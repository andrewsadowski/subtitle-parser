2; ;00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:08,580; ;Today's topic: 'Unconsidered Needs':  How Changing the Conversation Wins Sales
3; ;00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:10,380; ;Jane is a careful buyer.
4; ;00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:16,280; ;She's researched her options, carefully documented her needs, and invited three top vendors -
5; ;00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:20,400; ;all offering competitive products and pricing -- to submit a proposal.
6; ;00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:24,860; ;If you were one of the vendors, how would you assess your chances of getting the business?
7; ;00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:26,500; ;About one in three?
8; ;00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:34,400; ;What if you could increase those odds dramatically by engaging Jane in a different conversation from the one she intended to have?
9; ;00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:39,720; ;What if you could lock up the deal while everyone else was still waiting around to see who won?
10; ;00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:44,160; ;Conventional wisdom suggests two ways to create that conversation:
11; ;00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,560; ;One, you can try to change the rules.
12; ;00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:50,200; ;You tell the buyer, “You asked for X, but you really need Y” -
13; ;00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:54,440; ;Y, of course, being something that gives you an edge over your competitors.
14; ;00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:59,600; ;In other words, you tell Jane that despite all her due diligence, she made a mistake.
15; ;00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:05,940; ;Or two, you can try to add value, by throwing in something extra to tip the scales.
16; ;00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:10,880; ;But these days, with so many vendors and so much information, it's hard to be unique.
17; ;00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:15,640; ;Whatever “added value” you can offer, competitors can usually match.
18; ;00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:22,900; ;In this Quick Take, you will learn another way to change the odds in your favor when you're facing a buyer who thinks they know what they want.
19; ;00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:24,900; ;Specifically, you will learn:
20; ;00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:30,420; ;How talking about “unconsidered needs” can position you as a safer and better choice.
21; ;00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:34,280; ;The best time to bring them up in your sales presentation or proposal.
22; ;00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:39,400; ;And how to identify “unconsidered needs” that will resonate with your buyers.
23; ;00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:45,960; ;To get a better understanding of unconsidered needs and how to use them, let's look at a recent experiment:
24; ;00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:53,380; ;The study recruited 400 people and told them to imagine they were business owners seeking a $10 million line of credit.
25; ;00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:57,560; ;Each participant was asked to consider four different proposals:
26; ;00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:00,240; ;Proposal 1 gave the buyer what they asked for:
27; ;00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:09,000; ;It offered the line of credit at a competitive rate and explained that the lender had been in the community for 75 years and understood small business.
28; ;00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,740; ;Proposal 2 responded with similar positioning and also introduced “value-added services.”
29; ;00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:20,100; ;Specifically, the proposal included tailored services and on-staff experts.
30; ;00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:23,640; ;Proposal 3 also responded to what the buyer had asked for,
31; ;00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:27,180; ;and late in the buying process introduced an “unconsidered need” -
32; ;00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:29,700; ;a need that the buyer had never expressed.
33; ;00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:32,880; ;Specifically, the presenter said something like this:
34; ;00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:38,800; ;“Forty-two percent of companies who take a line of credit end up failing due to underlying problems in the business.
35; ;00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:43,300; ;So we come in and analyze your business to make sure there are no hidden issues.”
36; ;00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:47,960; ;Proposal 4 introduced the unconsidered need up front, instead of at the end.
37; ;00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:51,320; ;When the “customers” were asked which offer they wanted to go with,
38; ;00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:54,760; ;they were significantly more likely to choose Proposal 4 --
39; ;00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:58,160; ;the one that presented unconsidered needs at the beginning.
40; ;00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:03,960; ;An "unconsidered need" involves more than simply adding value through things like better terms.
41; ;00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,960; ;Any vendor can do that.
42; ;00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:10,060; ;It involves an additional need the buyer isn't taking into account,
43; ;00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:12,060; ;until you bring it up.
44; ;00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:18,360; ;In this study for example, the winning proposal first identified a new but related problem.
45; ;00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:22,040; ;That a high percentage of businesses taking a loan end up failing.
46; ;00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:25,720; ;And second, offered a solution to that problem.
47; ;00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:28,860; ;An in depth analysis of the buyer's business.
48; ;00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:36,140; ;When presented at the beginning of the proposal, the "unconsidered need" disrupts the buyer's decision making process -- in a good way!
49; ;00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:39,200; ;It forces the buyer to reconsider their needs,
50; ;00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,460; ;which changed the rules of the game in your favor.
51; ;00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:46,420; ;While your competitors are only solving the buyer's original problem,
52; ;00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:50,500; ;You're solving that problem, plus a new and different one.
53; ;00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:54,820; ;Sales people are in an ideal position to identify "unconsidered needs".
54; ;00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:57,640; ;Because they bring deep knowledge to the table.
55; ;00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:03,040; ;For the buyer, purchasing your product or service is only one of many challenges on their plate.
56; ;00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:08,820; ;For you as a sales person, solving these sorts of problems is your full time job.
57; ;00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:11,980; ;Here are two more examples of "unconsidered needs":
58; ;00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:16,700; ;You're looking for a courier service that can provide same-day delivery to your customers.
59; ;00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:21,280; ;But often that means deliveries will happen outside regular office hours.
60; ;00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:23,400; ;So, when you place an order with us,
61; ;00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:29,020; ;our dispatcher immediately calls your customer, to be sure someone will be available to accept delivery.
62; ;00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:34,060; ;Or, you're looking for a consultant who can help stream-line your business processes.
63; ;00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:38,820; ;But studies show that one of the most common reasons new business processes fail,
64; ;00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:41,980; ;is because front-line workers feel a lack of ownership.
65; ;00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:47,440; ;So, we collect ongoing input and feedback from these workers as part of our program.
66; ;00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:52,780; ;As you identify and present "unconsidered needs", consider three caveats:
67; ;00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:57,700; ;One: You’ll need to identify actual needs, not invented needs.
68; ;00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:02,040; ;This approach isn’t about pushing the buyer towards your product’s particular strengths.
69; ;00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:05,360; ;And it isn’t about finding an upselling opportunity.
70; ;00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:08,200; ;It’s about disrupting the buyer’s thinking.
71; ;00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:13,720; ;Two: Though we’ve called these needs “unconsidered,” the buyer may in fact be aware of them.
72; ;00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:19,080; ;But when you explicitly put them back on the table, you create the same disruptive effect.
73; ;00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:21,840; ;You're solving problems that your competitors aren't.
74; ;00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:27,340; ;And you gain credibility with your buyer by demonstrating that you understand their world.
75; ;00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:31,140; ;Three: Be careful how you phrase the unconsidered need.
76; ;00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:35,820; ;If you introduce it by saying, “Did you know…”, your buyer may feel patronized.
77; ;00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:40,800; ;Instead, simply identify the issue or introduce it with soft language –
78; ;00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:45,480; ;– for example, “We've found…” Or “What happens if…?”
79; ;00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:47,480; ;Let’s review what we’ve learned:
80; ;00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:53,220; ;When you merely respond to buyers’ stated needs, or emphasize value-added services,
81; ;00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:56,440; ;you risk getting lumped together with your competitors.
82; ;00:05:56,440 --> 00:06:00,700; ;Introducing “unconsidered needs” can disrupt the decision-making process,
83; ;00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:04,380; ;allowing you to propose a unique solution that sets you apart,
84; ;00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:06,500; ;and ultimately lands you the sale.
85; ;00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:07,660; ;Thanks for watching.

2; ;00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:08,160; ;Today’s topic: Communication: How prospects first decide whether to trust you.
3; ;00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:13,740; ;In this Quick Take, we’re going explore how prospects first decide whether to trust you.
4; ;00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:16,200; ;Let’s start with a basic question:
5; ;00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:17,940; ;What is trust?
6; ;00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:25,520; ;In long-term relationships with buyers, it means they believe they can count on us to do what we say and to treat them fairly.
7; ;00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:31,480; ;Over time, we have the chance to say and do things that build and sustain trust with our customers.
8; ;00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:34,380; ;But what about buyers we’ve never worked with before?
9; ;00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:39,260; ;What causes buyers to trust, or distrust, you in your initial meetings?
10; ;00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:41,440; ;In this Quick Take, you will learn:
11; ;00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:45,340; ;The two factors that determine trust early in relationships
12; ;00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:53,040; ;How quickly buyers make decisions about trustworthiness, based on verbal cues that salespeople often trigger unconsciously.
13; ;00:00:53,040 --> 00:01:00,860; ;And the four categories of verbal cues  – and how deploying them successfully will make people perceive you as more trustworthy.
14; ;00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:12,620; ;Numerous scientific studies have found that in the very early stages of any relationship – including a buyer-seller relationship – the decision to trust someone comes down to two questions:
15; ;00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:17,880; ;First: Is this person on my side – that is, are they willing to help me?
16; ;00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:22,100; ;And second, are they competent – are they able to help me?
17; ;00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:33,300; ;A study from Southern Methodist University found that people make up their minds about these two factors within minutes, and that the judgments are remarkably consistent from one person to the next.
18; ;00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:44,760; ;The researchers found that certain verbal cues – cues that you can incorporate into your initial sales conversations -- will increase prospects’ trust and willingness to engage with you.
19; ;00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:57,980; ;In the SMU experiment, researchers videotaped college students who’d been asked to speak off the cuff about various mundane topics – their classes, their experiences at college, what was going on in their lives at that moment.
20; ;00:01:57,980 --> 00:02:11,460; ;Then the researchers showed snippets of these videos – each snippet lasting about a minute and a half -- to a second group of students and asked them to evaluate each speaker on a variety of measures, including trustworthiness.
21; ;00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:21,580; ;The researchers analyzed the language used in the interviews, evaluating such things as how often people used negative words and positive words and how often they referred to themselves.
22; ;00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:26,140; ;Then the researchers looked at how the language related to trustworthiness.
23; ;00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:30,940; ;They found four verbal cues that were associated with high perceived trust:
24; ;00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:37,120; ;Using fewer “negative emotion” words – words such as “angry,” “sad” and “wrong”
25; ;00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:44,340; ;Speaking  in the present tense – that is, statements focused on the here-and-now rather than what’s happened in the past
26; ;00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:48,680; ;Using fewer “I,” “me” and “our” statements, and
27; ;00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:51,140; ;Speaking simply and directly.
28; ;00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:54,340; ;Nothing on this list will surprise sales reps.
29; ;00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:59,100; ;We’ve all been taught to be positive, present, customer-focused and clear.
30; ;00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:07,800; ;What may be less obvious is how deeply these four factors in particular relate to perceptions of trust when you first meet a prospect.
31; ;00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:15,120; ;They often operate on an unconscious level, sending the message to buyers that you’re willing and able to help them.
32; ;00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:20,520; ;Of the four, the one with the greatest impact on trust is speaking simply and directly.
33; ;00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:25,480; ;Researchers measured it by counting the number of “unique words” in each video snippet.
34; ;00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:30,440; ;People who speak simply used a limited vocabulary of everyday words over and over.
35; ;00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:41,120; ;Those who fill their speech with jargon, fillers and qualifiers end up with a higher unique word count, and are perceived as anxious, uncertain or dishonest.
36; ;00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:45,040; ;For example, how much would you trust someone who said this?
37; ;00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:48,600; ;“We would all have to say that mistakes were made in terms of comments.
38; ;00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:55,840; ;I was overenthusiastic in my comments … particularly if you look at them in the context of developments that have taken place.”
39; ;00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:04,660; ;That statement, which of course sounds evasive and dishonest, came from Nixon’s press secretary in 1973, during Watergate.
40; ;00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:07,920; ;You’d trigger the same reaction if you told a prospect,
41; ;00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:18,680; ;“All things being equal, and assuming conditions remain largely in line with current expectations, you can expect to see a reasonable increase in revenues, beginning over the course of 60 to 90 days.”
42; ;00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:25,460; ;Buyers trust straight talk, as in, “You can expect revenues to go up 6% in a couple of months.”
43; ;00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:31,580; ;Now let’s turn to the other three cues that influence trust, starting with negative emotions.
44; ;00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:41,140; ;The research found that words such as “angry,” “sad” and “wrong” undermine perceived trustworthiness, even when the speakers were talking about mundane topics.
45; ;00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:43,280; ;There’s no real surprise there.
46; ;00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:50,460; ;But it’s easy for negative language to creep into conversations with prospects, even when we’re trying to be positive and helpful.
47; ;00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:55,240; ;We might ask, for example, “What would you say is your biggest challenge right now?”
48; ;00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:58,120; ;Or even worse, “What keeps you up at night?”
49; ;00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:03,900; ;Later in a relationship, after you’ve built up a reservoir of trust, you can ask questions like that.
50; ;00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:10,660; ;But in initial encounters, eliciting negative emotions undermines prospects’ confidence in you.
51; ;00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:19,940; ;This finding is consistent with other studies showing that focusing too much on buyers’ fears can increase their anxiety and make them less likely to buy.
52; ;00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:22,640; ;Of course you must discover the buyer’s needs.
53; ;00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:26,100; ;But you can use positive instead of negative language.
54; ;00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:28,880; ;Instead of challenges, ask about opportunities:
55; ;00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,960; ;“If you could do one thing better, what would it be?”
56; ;00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:38,000; ;Instead of asking about the buyer’s “pain,” ask: “What would the ideal outcome look like for you?”
57; ;00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,280; ;Instead of asking what keeps them up at night, find out what would make them sleep better.
58; ;00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:49,640; ;The last two factors -- present tense and fewer I statements – seem to be about mindfulness and focus.
59; ;00:05:49,640 --> 00:06:03,520; ;Citing your track record with other customers, or your own credentials, takes the spotlight off the buyer’s biggest concern – whether you can help him or her right now -- and puts it on what you did for someone else at another time.
60; ;00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:14,500; ;You may think you’re showing your willingness and ability to help the prospect, but the “I” language, and references to past successes, causes the buyer to disconnect and erodes trust.
61; ;00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:16,820; ;Let’s review what we’ve learned today:
62; ;00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:23,920; ;Prospects will make a gut decision – often within the first minute or two -- about whether they trust you enough to continue to engage.
63; ;00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:27,000; ;They’re judging you on two key questions:
64; ;00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,400; ;“Are you willing to help me?” And “are you able to help me?”
65; ;00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:35,980; ;How you structure that first conversation will have a big impact on those answers.
66; ;00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:42,180; ;Research has found four verbal cues that you can use to increase your perceived trustworthiness:
67; ;00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:43,980; ;Avoid negative language.
68; ;00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:47,580; ;Speak in the present tense—focus on the here and now.

1; ;00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:02,840; ;Welcome to this Quick Take rapid learning module.
2; ;00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:08,160; ;Today’s topic: Communication: How prospects first decide whether to trust you.
3; ;00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:13,740; ;In this Quick Take, we’re going explore how prospects first decide whether to trust you.
4; ;00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:16,200; ;Let’s start with a basic question:
5; ;00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:17,940; ;What is trust?
6; ;00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:25,520; ;In long-term relationships with buyers, it means they believe they can count on us to do what we say and to treat them fairly.
7; ;00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:31,480; ;Over time, we have the chance to say and do things that build and sustain trust with our customers.
8; ;00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:34,380; ;But what about buyers we’ve never worked with before?
9; ;00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:39,260; ;What causes buyers to trust, or distrust, you in your initial meetings?
10; ;00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:41,440; ;In this Quick Take, you will learn:
11; ;00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:45,340; ;The two factors that determine trust early in relationships.
12; ;00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:53,040; ;How quickly buyers make decisions about trustworthiness, based on verbal cues that salespeople often trigger unconsciously.
13; ;00:00:53,040 --> 00:01:00,860; ;And the four categories of verbal cues  – and how deploying them successfully will make people perceive you as more trustworthy.
14; ;00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:12,620; ;Numerous scientific studies have found that in the very early stages of any relationship – including a buyer-seller relationship – the decision to trust someone comes down to two questions:
15; ;00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:17,880; ;First: Is this person on my side – that is, are they willing to help me?
16; ;00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:22,100; ;And second, are they competent – are they able to help me?
17; ;00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:33,300; ;A study from Southern Methodist University found that people make up their minds about these two factors within minutes, and that the judgments are remarkably consistent from one person to the next.
18; ;00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:44,760; ;The researchers found that certain verbal cues – cues that you can incorporate into your initial sales conversations -- will increase prospects’ trust and willingness to engage with you.
19; ;00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:57,980; ;In the SMU experiment, researchers videotaped college students who’d been asked to speak off the cuff about various mundane topics – their classes, their experiences at college, what was going on in their lives at that moment.
20; ;00:01:57,980 --> 00:02:11,460; ;Then the researchers showed snippets of these videos – each snippet lasting about a minute and a half -- to a second group of students and asked them to evaluate each speaker on a variety of measures, including trustworthiness.
21; ;00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:21,580; ;The researchers analyzed the language used in the interviews, evaluating such things as how often people used negative words and positive words and how often they referred to themselves.
22; ;00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:26,140; ;Then the researchers looked at how the language related to trustworthiness.
23; ;00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:30,940; ;They found four verbal cues that were associated with high perceived trust:
24; ;00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:37,120; ;Using fewer “negative emotion” words – words such as “angry,” “sad” and “wrong”
25; ;00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:44,340; ;Speaking  in the present tense – that is, statements focused on the here-and-now rather than what’s happened in the past.
26; ;00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:51,140; ;Using fewer “I,” “me” and “our” statements, and speaking simply and directly.
27; ;00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:54,340; ;Nothing on this list will surprise sales reps.
28; ;00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:59,100; ;We’ve all been taught to be positive, present, customer-focused and clear.
29; ;00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:07,800; ;What may be less obvious is how deeply these four factors in particular relate to perceptions of trust when you first meet a prospect.
30; ;00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:15,120; ;They often operate on an unconscious level, sending the message to buyers that you’re willing and able to help them.
31; ;00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:20,520; ;Of the four, the one with the greatest impact on trust is speaking simply and directly.
32; ;00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:25,480; ;Researchers measured it by counting the number of “unique words” in each video snippet.
33; ;00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:30,440; ;People who speak simply used a limited vocabulary of everyday words over and over.
34; ;00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:41,120; ;Those who fill their speech with jargon, fillers and qualifiers end up with a higher unique word count, and are perceived as anxious, uncertain or dishonest.
35; ;00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:45,040; ;For example, how much would you trust someone who said this?
36; ;00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:48,600; ;“We would all have to say that mistakes were made in terms of comments.
37; ;00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:55,840; ;I was overenthusiastic in my comments … particularly if you look at them in the context of developments that have taken place.”
38; ;00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:04,660; ;That statement, which of course sounds evasive and dishonest, came from Nixon’s press secretary in 1973, during Watergate.
39; ;00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:07,920; ;You’d trigger the same reaction if you told a prospect,
40; ;00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:18,680; ;“All things being equal, and assuming conditions remain largely in line with current expectations, you can expect to see a reasonable increase in revenues, beginning over the course of 60 to 90 days.”
41; ;00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:25,460; ;Buyers trust straight talk, as in, “You can expect revenues to go up 6% in a couple of months.”
42; ;00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:31,580; ;Now let’s turn to the other three cues that influence trust, starting with negative emotions.
43; ;00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:41,140; ;The research found that words such as “angry,” “sad” and “wrong” undermine perceived trustworthiness, even when the speakers were talking about mundane topics.
44; ;00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:43,280; ;There’s no real surprise there.
45; ;00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:50,460; ;But it’s easy for negative language to creep into conversations with prospects, even when we’re trying to be positive and helpful.
46; ;00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:55,240; ;We might ask, for example, “What would you say is your biggest challenge right now?”
47; ;00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:58,120; ;Or even worse, “What keeps you up at night?”
48; ;00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:03,900; ;Later in a relationship, after you’ve built up a reservoir of trust, you can ask questions like that.
49; ;00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:10,660; ;But in initial encounters, eliciting negative emotions undermines prospects’ confidence in you.
50; ;00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:19,940; ;This finding is consistent with other studies showing that focusing too much on buyers’ fears can increase their anxiety and make them less likely to buy.
51; ;00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:22,640; ;Of course you must discover the buyer’s needs.
52; ;00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:26,100; ;But you can use positive instead of negative language.
53; ;00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:28,880; ;Instead of challenges, ask about opportunities:
54; ;00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,960; ;“If you could do one thing better, what would it be?”
55; ;00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:38,000; ;Instead of asking about the buyer’s “pain,” ask: “What would the ideal outcome look like for you?”
56; ;00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,280; ;Instead of asking what keeps them up at night, find out what would make them sleep better.
57; ;00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:49,640; ;The last two factors -- present tense and fewer I statements – seem to be about mindfulness and focus.
58; ;00:05:49,640 --> 00:06:03,520; ;Citing your track record with other customers, or your own credentials, takes the spotlight off the buyer’s biggest concern – whether you can help him or her right now -- and puts it on what you did for someone else at another time.
59; ;00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:14,500; ;You may think you’re showing your willingness and ability to help the prospect, but the “I” language, and references to past successes, causes the buyer to disconnect and erodes trust.
60; ;00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:16,820; ;Let’s review what we’ve learned today:
61; ;00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:23,920; ;Prospects will make a gut decision – often within the first minute or two -- about whether they trust you enough to continue to engage.
62; ;00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:27,000; ;They’re judging you on two key questions:
63; ;00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,400; ;“Are you willing to help me?” And “are you able to help me?”
64; ;00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:35,980; ;How you structure that first conversation will have a big impact on those answers.

1; ;00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:02,840; ;Welcome to this Quick Take rapid learning module.
2; ;00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:08,160; ;Today’s topic: Communication: How prospects first decide whether to trust you.
3; ;00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:13,740; ;In this Quick Take, we’re going explore how prospects first decide whether to trust you.
4; ;00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:16,200; ;Let’s start with a basic question:
5; ;00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:17,940; ;What is trust?
6; ;00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:25,520; ;In long-term relationships with buyers, it means they believe they can count on us to do what we say and to treat them fairly.
7; ;00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:31,480; ;Over time, we have the chance to say and do things that build and sustain trust with our customers.
8; ;00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:34,380; ;But what about buyers we’ve never worked with before?
9; ;00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:39,260; ;What causes buyers to trust, or distrust, you in your initial meetings?
10; ;00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:41,440; ;In this Quick Take, you will learn:
11; ;00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:45,340; ;The two factors that determine trust early in relationships.
12; ;00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:53,040; ;How quickly buyers make decisions about trustworthiness, based on verbal cues that salespeople often trigger unconsciously.
13; ;00:00:53,040 --> 00:01:00,860; ;And the four categories of verbal cues  – and how deploying them successfully will make people perceive you as more trustworthy.
14; ;00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:12,620; ;Numerous scientific studies have found that in the very early stages of any relationship – including a buyer-seller relationship – the decision to trust someone comes down to two questions:
15; ;00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:17,880; ;First: Is this person on my side – that is, are they willing to help me?
16; ;00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:22,100; ;And second, are they competent – are they able to help me?
17; ;00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:33,300; ;A study from Southern Methodist University found that people make up their minds about these two factors within minutes, and that the judgments are remarkably consistent from one person to the next.
18; ;00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:44,760; ;The researchers found that certain verbal cues – cues that you can incorporate into your initial sales conversations -- will increase prospects’ trust and willingness to engage with you.
19; ;00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:57,980; ;In the SMU experiment, researchers videotaped college students who’d been asked to speak off the cuff about various mundane topics – their classes, their experiences at college, what was going on in their lives at that moment.
20; ;00:01:57,980 --> 00:02:11,460; ;Then the researchers showed snippets of these videos – each snippet lasting about a minute and a half -- to a second group of students and asked them to evaluate each speaker on a variety of measures, including trustworthiness.
21; ;00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:21,580; ;The researchers analyzed the language used in the interviews, evaluating such things as how often people used negative words and positive words and how often they referred to themselves.
22; ;00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:26,140; ;Then the researchers looked at how the language related to trustworthiness.
23; ;00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:30,940; ;They found four verbal cues that were associated with high perceived trust:
24; ;00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:37,120; ;Using fewer “negative emotion” words – words such as “angry,” “sad” and “wrong”
25; ;00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:44,340; ;Speaking  in the present tense – that is, statements focused on the here-and-now rather than what’s happened in the past.
26; ;00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:51,140; ;Using fewer “I,” “me” and “our” statements, and speaking simply and directly.
27; ;00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:54,340; ;Nothing on this list will surprise sales reps.
28; ;00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:59,100; ;We’ve all been taught to be positive, present, customer-focused and clear.
29; ;00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:07,800; ;What may be less obvious is how deeply these four factors in particular relate to perceptions of trust when you first meet a prospect.
30; ;00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:15,120; ;They often operate on an unconscious level, sending the message to buyers that you’re willing and able to help them.
31; ;00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:20,520; ;Of the four, the one with the greatest impact on trust is speaking simply and directly.
32; ;00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:25,480; ;Researchers measured it by counting the number of “unique words” in each video snippet.
33; ;00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:30,440; ;People who speak simply used a limited vocabulary of everyday words over and over.
34; ;00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:41,120; ;Those who fill their speech with jargon, fillers and qualifiers end up with a higher unique word count, and are perceived as anxious, uncertain or dishonest.
35; ;00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:45,040; ;For example, how much would you trust someone who said this?
36; ;00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:48,600; ;“We would all have to say that mistakes were made in terms of comments.
37; ;00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:55,840; ;I was overenthusiastic in my comments … particularly if you look at them in the context of developments that have taken place.”
38; ;00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:04,660; ;That statement, which of course sounds evasive and dishonest, came from Nixon’s press secretary in 1973, during Watergate.
39; ;00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:07,920; ;You’d trigger the same reaction if you told a prospect,
40; ;00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:18,680; ;“All things being equal, and assuming conditions remain largely in line with current expectations, you can expect to see a reasonable increase in revenues, beginning over the course of 60 to 90 days.”
41; ;00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:25,460; ;Buyers trust straight talk, as in, “You can expect revenues to go up 6% in a couple of months.”
42; ;00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:31,580; ;Now let’s turn to the other three cues that influence trust, starting with negative emotions.
43; ;00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:41,140; ;The research found that words such as “angry,” “sad” and “wrong” undermine perceived trustworthiness, even when the speakers were talking about mundane topics.
44; ;00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:43,280; ;There’s no real surprise there.
45; ;00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:50,460; ;But it’s easy for negative language to creep into conversations with prospects, even when we’re trying to be positive and helpful.
46; ;00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:55,240; ;We might ask, for example, “What would you say is your biggest challenge right now?”
47; ;00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:58,120; ;Or even worse, “What keeps you up at night?”
48; ;00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:03,900; ;Later in a relationship, after you’ve built up a reservoir of trust, you can ask questions like that.
49; ;00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:10,660; ;But in initial encounters, eliciting negative emotions undermines prospects’ confidence in you.
50; ;00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:19,940; ;This finding is consistent with other studies showing that focusing too much on buyers’ fears can increase their anxiety and make them less likely to buy.
51; ;00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:22,640; ;Of course you must discover the buyer’s needs.
52; ;00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:26,100; ;But you can use positive instead of negative language.
53; ;00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:28,880; ;Instead of challenges, ask about opportunities:
54; ;00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,960; ;“If you could do one thing better, what would it be?”
55; ;00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:38,000; ;Instead of asking about the buyer’s “pain,” ask: “What would the ideal outcome look like for you?”
56; ;00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,280; ;Instead of asking what keeps them up at night, find out what would make them sleep better.
57; ;00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:49,640; ;The last two factors -- present tense and fewer I statements – seem to be about mindfulness and focus.
58; ;00:05:49,640 --> 00:06:03,520; ;Citing your track record with other customers, or your own credentials, takes the spotlight off the buyer’s biggest concern – whether you can help him or her right now -- and puts it on what you did for someone else at another time.
59; ;00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:14,500; ;You may think you’re showing your willingness and ability to help the prospect, but the “I” language, and references to past successes, causes the buyer to disconnect and erodes trust.
60; ;00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:16,820; ;Let’s review what we’ve learned today:
61; ;00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:23,920; ;Prospects will make a gut decision – often within the first minute or two -- about whether they trust you enough to continue to engage.
62; ;00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:27,000; ;They’re judging you on two key questions:
63; ;00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,400; ;“Are you willing to help me?” And “are you able to help me?”
64; ;00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:35,980; ;How you structure that first conversation will have a big impact on those answers.
65; ;00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:42,180; ;Research has found four verbal cues that you can use to increase your perceived trustworthiness:
66; ;00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:43,980; ;Avoid negative language.
67; ;00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:47,580; ;Speak in the present tense—focus on the here and now.
68; ;00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:49,220; ;Don’t talk about yourself.
69; ;00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:51,140; ;Keep the focus on your prospect.
70; ;00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:57,060; ;And most important, be direct—use simple language and don’t beat around the bush.
71; ;00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:58,080; ;Thanks for watching.
72; ;00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:01,020; ;Now, return to the program page and take the quiz.

2; ;00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:08,580; ;Today's topic: 'Unconsidered Needs':  How Changing the Conversation Wins Sales
3; ;00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:10,380; ;Jane is a careful buyer.
4; ;00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:20,400; ;She's researched her options, carefully documented her needs, and invited three top vendors - all offering competitive products and pricing -- to submit a proposal.
5; ;00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:24,860; ;If you were one of the vendors, how would you assess your chances of getting the business?
6; ;00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:26,500; ;About one in three?
7; ;00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:34,400; ;What if you could increase those odds dramatically by engaging Jane in a different conversation from the one she intended to have?
8; ;00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:39,720; ;What if you could lock up the deal while everyone else was still waiting around to see who won?
9; ;00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:44,160; ;Conventional wisdom suggests two ways to create that conversation:
10; ;00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,560; ;One, you can try to change the rules.
11; ;00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:50,200; ;You tell the buyer, “You asked for X, but you really need Y” -
12; ;00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:54,440; ;Y, of course, being something that gives you an edge over your competitors.
13; ;00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:59,600; ;In other words, you tell Jane that despite all her due diligence, she made a mistake.
14; ;00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:05,940; ;Or two, you can try to add value, by throwing in something extra to tip the scales.
15; ;00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:10,880; ;But these days, with so many vendors and so much information, it's hard to be unique.
16; ;00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:15,640; ;Whatever “added value” you can offer, competitors can usually match.
17; ;00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:22,900; ;In this Quick Take, you will learn another way to change the odds in your favor when you're facing a buyer who thinks they know what they want.
18; ;00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:24,900; ;Specifically, you will learn:
19; ;00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:30,420; ;How talking about “unconsidered needs” can position you as a safer and better choice.
20; ;00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:34,280; ;The best time to bring them up in your sales presentation or proposal.
21; ;00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:39,400; ;And how to identify “unconsidered needs” that will resonate with your buyers.
22; ;00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:45,960; ;To get a better understanding of unconsidered needs and how to use them, let's look at a recent experiment:
23; ;00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:53,380; ;The study recruited 400 people and told them to imagine they were business owners seeking a $10 million line of credit.
24; ;00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:57,560; ;Each participant was asked to consider four different proposals:
25; ;00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:00,240; ;Proposal 1 gave the buyer what they asked for:
26; ;00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:09,000; ;It offered the line of credit at a competitive rate and explained that the lender had been in the community for 75 years and understood small business.
27; ;00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,740; ;Proposal 2 responded with similar positioning and also introduced “value-added services.”
28; ;00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:20,100; ;Specifically, the proposal included tailored services and on-staff experts.
29; ;00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:29,700; ;Proposal 3 also responded to what the buyer had asked for, and late in the buying process introduced an “unconsidered need” - a need that the buyer had never expressed.
30; ;00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:32,880; ;Specifically, the presenter said something like this:
31; ;00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:38,800; ;“Forty-two percent of companies who take a line of credit end up failing due to underlying problems in the business.
32; ;00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:43,300; ;So we come in and analyze your business to make sure there are no hidden issues.”
33; ;00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:47,960; ;Proposal 4 introduced the unconsidered need up front, instead of at the end.
34; ;00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:51,320; ;When the “customers” were asked which offer they wanted to go with,
35; ;00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:54,760; ;they were significantly more likely to choose Proposal 4 --
36; ;00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:58,160; ;the one that presented unconsidered needs at the beginning.
37; ;00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:03,960; ;An "unconsidered need" involves more than simply adding value through things like better terms.
38; ;00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,960; ;Any vendor can do that.
39; ;00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:10,060; ;It involves an additional need the buyer isn't taking into account,
40; ;00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:12,060; ;until you bring it up.
41; ;00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:18,360; ;In this study for example, the winning proposal first identified a new but related problem.
42; ;00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:22,040; ;That a high percentage of businesses taking a loan end up failing.
43; ;00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:25,720; ;And second, offered a solution to that problem.
44; ;00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:28,860; ;An in depth analysis of the buyer's business.
45; ;00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:36,140; ;When presented at the beginning of the proposal, the "unconsidered need" disrupts the buyer's decision making process -- in a good way!
46; ;00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:42,460; ;It forces the buyer to reconsider their needs, which changed the rules of the game in your favor.
47; ;00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:46,420; ;While your competitors are only solving the buyer's original problem,
48; ;00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:50,500; ;You're solving that problem, plus a new and different one.
49; ;00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:54,820; ;Sales people are in an ideal position to identify "unconsidered needs".
50; ;00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:57,640; ;Because they bring deep knowledge to the table.
51; ;00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:03,040; ;For the buyer, purchasing your product or service is only one of many challenges on their plate.
52; ;00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:08,820; ;For you as a sales person, solving these sorts of problems is your full time job.
53; ;00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:11,980; ;Here are two more examples of "unconsidered needs":
54; ;00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:16,700; ;You're looking for a courier service that can provide same-day delivery to your customers.
55; ;00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:21,280; ;But often that means deliveries will happen outside regular office hours.
56; ;00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:29,020; ;So, when you place an order with us, our dispatcher immediately calls your customer, to be sure someone will be available to accept delivery.
57; ;00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:34,060; ;Or, you're looking for a consultant who can help stream-line your business processes.
58; ;00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:41,980; ;But studies show that one of the most common reasons new business processes fail, is because front-line workers feel a lack of ownership.
59; ;00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:47,440; ;So, we collect ongoing input and feedback from these workers as part of our program.
60; ;00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:52,780; ;As you identify and present "unconsidered needs", consider three caveats:
61; ;00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:57,700; ;One: You’ll need to identify actual needs, not invented needs.
62; ;00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:02,040; ;This approach isn’t about pushing the buyer towards your product’s particular strengths.
63; ;00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:05,360; ;And it isn’t about finding an upselling opportunity.
64; ;00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:08,200; ;It’s about disrupting the buyer’s thinking.
65; ;00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:13,720; ;Two: Though we’ve called these needs “unconsidered,” the buyer may in fact be aware of them.
66; ;00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:19,080; ;But when you explicitly put them back on the table, you create the same disruptive effect.
67; ;00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:21,840; ;You're solving problems that your competitors aren't.
68; ;00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:27,340; ;And you gain credibility with your buyer by demonstrating that you understand their world.
69; ;00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:31,140; ;Three: Be careful how you phrase the unconsidered need.
70; ;00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:35,820; ;If you introduce it by saying, “Did you know…”, your buyer may feel patronized.
71; ;00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:45,480; ;Instead, simply identify the issue or introduce it with soft language – – for example, “We've found…” Or “What happens if…?”
72; ;00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:47,480; ;Let’s review what we’ve learned:
73; ;00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:56,440; ;When you merely respond to buyers’ stated needs, or emphasize value-added services, you risk getting lumped together with your competitors.
74; ;00:05:56,440 --> 00:06:06,500; ;Introducing “unconsidered needs” can disrupt the decision-making process, allowing you to propose a unique solution that sets you apart, and ultimately lands you the sale.
75; ;00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:07,660; ;Thanks for watching.

3; ;00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:20,000; ;When prospects buy in to your sales proposals - when they start using language like “mine” and “ours” instead of “you” and “yours” - you know you're well on your way to winning the sale.
4; ;00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,940; ;But how do you get buyers there?
5; ;00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:26,340; ;What makes them take psychological ownership of the solutions you recommend?
6; ;00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:28,540; ;In this Quick Take, you will learn:
7; ;00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:34,160; ;The power of psychological ownership, and its effect on perceived value and loyalty.
8; ;00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:42,120; ;The critical element that creates a sense of ownership, and how to incorporate that element into your sales process.
9; ;00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:45,820; ;It's no secret that we put a higher value on the things we own.
10; ;00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:51,420; ;Think of your favorite coffee mug, the chair you always sit in at the dinner table or the brand of car you drive.
11; ;00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:55,340; ;They're not all that different or better than other mugs, chairs or cars.
12; ;00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:58,100; ;We simply like them more because they're ours.
13; ;00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:04,960; ;Psychologists call this phenomenon the “endowment effect” and it's been demonstrated in experiments many times.
14; ;00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:09,380; ;One of the most famous of those experiments actually did involve coffee mugs.
15; ;00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:16,660; ;Experimenters gave mugs to a group of people selected at random, then asked how much money they'd accept to part with “their” mug.
16; ;00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:20,540; ;The average price: Five dollars and seventy-eight cents.
17; ;00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:27,320; ;Then the researchers asked another group of people - who hadn't been given mugs - how much they'd be willing to pay to get one.
18; ;00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:32,380; ;This time the average price was far lower: just two dollars and twenty-one cents.
19; ;00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:34,500; ;Consider what that experiment means.
20; ;00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:39,340; ;The simple fact of ownership more than doubled the perceived value of the mugs.
21; ;00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:48,240; ;And that was for a generic low-value item that people hadn't asked for, hadn't selected, hadn't paid for and had only “owned” for a short time.
22; ;00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,620; ;The implications for sales are clear:
23; ;00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:57,960; ;Once your buyers take psychological ownership of your proposal, they value it much more highly and are more committed to it.
24; ;00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:02,280; ;But the question remains: How can you create that sense of ownership?
25; ;00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:07,920; ;You can use some well-established sales techniques to signal ownership when you present your recommendations.
26; ;00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:15,540; ;For example, referring to the product as “yours,” or offering trial periods or pilot programs to get buyers using it.
27; ;00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:19,780; ;But there's a deeper way to tap into the buyer's sense of ownership.
28; ;00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:23,800; ;Let's start by considering what it really means to own something.
29; ;00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:29,720; ;From a legal standpoint, ownership is fairly cut and dried -- a matter of rights and obligations.
30; ;00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:35,000; ;But psychological ownership is an emotion - we feel that something belongs to us.
31; ;00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,040; ;And it's closely related to feelings of power and control.
32; ;00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:45,760; ;When we own something, it means we get to make decisions about how it's used and what it's used for.
33; ;00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:49,900; ;It turns out that those feelings run in the other direction too.
34; ;00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:54,520; ;When we exert control over something, psychological ownership increases.
35; ;00:02:54,520 --> 00:03:01,460; ;So giving buyers the opportunity to exert control over proposals is the critical element for getting their buy in.
36; ;00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:11,440; ;To see how control influences psychological ownership, let's look at another series of experiments, involving online sites that allowed people to “build” their own products.
37; ;00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:17,480; ;Though these experiments involved Web purchases, the results are relevant to nearly any type of sale.
38; ;00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:22,940; ;Not surprisingly, when people were invited to “design” a T-shirt, scarf or cellphone case,
39; ;00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:26,840; ;they were willing to pay more for it than for a similar off-the-shelf product.
40; ;00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:32,120; ;But what's interesting about these experiments is that people weren't really “designing” their products.
41; ;00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:34,340; ;They were simply making choices.
42; ;00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:42,400; ;With the T-shirts, for example, people had only a limited set of options to select from, and could make only minor modifications to the designs.
43; ;00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:47,840; ;Even so, they were willing to pay 44% more than for an off-the-shelf product.
44; ;00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,440; ;Because they'd “designed it themselves.”
45; ;00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:54,380; ;You can take a similar approach to building proposals. Here's how:
46; ;00:03:54,380 --> 00:04:03,320; ;Whether you're selling ball bearings, software, professional services or anything else, nearly every sales proposal involves a series of decision points.
47; ;00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:06,900; ;Invite the buyer to participate in some of those decisions.
48; ;00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:09,080; ;Note the word “some.”
49; ;00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:13,340; ;Decades of research has shown that too much choice is counterproductive.
50; ;00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:18,020; ;Buyers become overwhelmed and often end up choosing nothing at all.
51; ;00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:21,920; ;Instead, do what the researchers did in the T-shirt experiment:
52; ;00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:25,940; ;Offer a few choices within the context of your overall proposal.
53; ;00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:29,140; ;Their buyers couldn't design tuxedos or hats.
54; ;00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:33,340; ;They couldn't draw their own designs. They really only had a few decisions.
55; ;00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:37,860; ;Which design to select, where it would be placed on the shirt, and so on.
56; ;00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:42,300; ;But those limited choices were enough to create perceived ownership.
57; ;00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:45,840; ;Look for similar opportunities in your own proposal process.
58; ;00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:52,060; ;For a professional services company, you might scope a project in three different ways and let prospects choose.
59; ;00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:59,160; ;For manufactured goods, you might invite buyers to choose from among several options for delivery, training or service.
60; ;00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:04,120; ;According to the research, it doesn't much matter whether these decisions are large or small.
61; ;00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:10,760; ;What's important is that when prospects make choices, they begin to see “your” proposal as their own.
62; ;00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:13,320; ;Let's review what we've learned in this Quick Take:
63; ;00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:17,500; ;Psychological ownership increases perceived value and loyalty.
64; ;00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:23,260; ;Ultimately, ownership is an emotion, closely related to feelings of power and control.
65; ;00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:30,940; ;To increase psychological ownership, offer buyers choices and let them “build their own solution” - with your guidance and help.
66; ;00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:34,920; ;Thanks for watching. Now, return to the program page and take the quiz.
67; ;00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:41,120; ;Also, please take 15 seconds to click on the survey link and fill out an evaluation of this program.
1; ;00:00:06,848 --> 00:00:11,600; ;Hi, I'm Stephen Smith and I'm part of the Global Enterprise segment, office of the CTO.
2; ;00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:18,496; ;And today we're going to be discussing the cloud-ready network, and why it's important to you and more so to your customer.
3; ;00:00:18,490 --> 00:00:26,576; ;To begin with I'd like to start with three key takeaways, and if you remember nothing else from this presentation these are the three most important items for you to consider.
4; ;00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:30,660; ;First, the cloud ready network is a blueprint - a blueprint.
5; ;00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:34,112; ;We've had other successful blueprints at Cisco.
6; ;00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:45,536; ;The security architecture framework for enterprise, or SAFE, that gave us a way to introduce security technologies into our customers' network and give a very prescriptive way of doing that.
7; ;00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:50,940; ;We also had AVID, the architecture for voice video and integrated data.
8; ;00:00:50,940 --> 00:01:00,912; ;Again, giving us credibility, showing how we could take a PBX-switched network and moving that onto an IP network, a very prescriptive way of doing that.
9; ;00:01:00,910 --> 00:01:15,680; ;The cloud-ready network is very similar: it provides an end-to-end mapping of our enterprise architectures to paint a clear picture of how customers can address all the changing dynamics of their applications and their network today.
10; ;00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:20,820; ;The second thing I'd like to talk about is cloud-ready network is real, and this is really important.
11; ;00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:34,592; ;It's real, it's built on real architectures, real validated designs; our customers can adopt that today as products we sell today, our partners can install it, we have advanced services, it's real.
12; ;00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:39,160; ;And the third item: it's our advantage. It takes us out of the knife fight.
13; ;00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:49,248; ;No longer are we selling an access point against this competitive access point, or a router against a competitive router: we're taking a better together approach, a platform approach.
14; ;00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:57,880; ;I'd like you to consider this: I had a customer the other day, which a major account in GES, average run rate of about 7 million dollars a year.
15; ;00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:12,300; ;And over the course of a 12 week engagement, using the "IT as a business" business case, which I'll introduce shortly, they were able to put a proposal on the table with less than a 2 year ROI for 73 million dollars.
16; ;00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:20,780; ;Now I know that seems like a lot, but let's just say that you could double the run rate in your account by implementing this type of template, this type of blueprint.
17; ;00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:23,520; ;That would be a pretty big deal.
18; ;00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,380; ;So more importantly, what are our customers asking for?
19; ;00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:32,180; ;So if we take a look at that, our customers are asking for a couple of key things that we can provide.
20; ;00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:36,340; ;First, they're looking for agility, agility in their business.
21; ;00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:42,860; ;So they can launch new digital services and partnerships into their business model.
22; ;00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:47,040; ;In addition, they're looking at things like digitizing end-to-end.
23; ;00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:54,300; ;And by that digitization, they are able to consolidate current business processes and give them more agility.
24; ;00:02:54,300 --> 00:03:01,260; ;And last, they're looking to improve execution in key areas, things like sales effectiveness or supply chain management.
25; ;00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:12,240; ;All of those things contribute to a couple of key topics, or key summary points, which are things like increasing revenue, driving profitability, and doing it in secure fashion.
26; ;00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:16,980; ;So growing the top line and bottom line, but doing it securely.
27; ;00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:19,640; ;So how does Cloud-Ready Network impact that?
28; ;00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:23,700; ;So financially if we take a look at it there's a couple of key areas there.
29; ;00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:27,300; ;First taking cost out of the network.
30; ;00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:35,700; ;On average we're seeing 25-30% cost take out on network transport alone and the operations of that network.
31; ;00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:46,100; ;We're able to provide increased agility in those networks, which basically equates to faster time-to-market for new applications and services for their customers.
32; ;00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:47,920; ;That's a big deal.
33; ;00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:52,180; ;And last in provides increased security.
34; ;00:03:52,180 --> 00:04:02,860; ;That security is key to everything they do today, when on average security breaches in the US are now topping 7 million dollars per occurence.
35; ;00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:09,500; ;All right, but if you really take a step back and look at this, what does this really give us an opportunity to do?
36; ;00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:19,200; ;It's drive network refresh, all right, drive network refresh by freeing up the capital, the budget, by taking cost out of their existing network.
37; ;00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:27,140; ;And that's a really big deal because customers usually have that as the stop point when we try to introduce new technologies.
38; ;00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:30,880; ;So this does give us that ability.
39; ;00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:37,800; ;And that is based on using a business case called IT as a business, that supports the cloud-ready network.
40; ;00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:42,540; ;It's a very prescriptive way of targeting your addressable network spend.
41; ;00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:46,780; ;Which is roughly 15% on average of your IT budget in a customer.
42; ;00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:54,060; ;You look at that and it's about two different pieces: transport cost and the cost to operate that.
43; ;00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:59,840; ;We take an as-is snapshot (how much are you spending today?) and then a proposed to-be.
44; ;00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:05,620; ;And that to-be on average reduces that network spend by 25-30%.
45; ;00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:09,380; ;Again that's where you find the money to fund the network refresh.
46; ;00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:13,560; ;So this is very important, this blueprint has a business case behind it.
47; ;00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:20,640; ;So each area of the network, you can attribute some sort of cost out.
48; ;00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:23,020; ;So what is this cloud-ready network?
49; ;00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:28,460; ;So if you look at how networks have been built for the past 30 plus years, they've been data-center centric.
50; ;00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:29,800; ;What does that mean?
51; ;00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:34,380; ;Well that means you assume that most of your applications live in the data center.
52; ;00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:48,900; ;Those models were based on a customer and an employee being in a brick and mortar location, traveling across the network on some kind of private, carrier-centric line, be it private data circuits, or MPLS...
53; ;00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:59,020; ;connecting to a data center, where again you assume that the application was going to be in the data center, the exception was you'd access something outside the data center on the Internet.
54; ;00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:05,960; ;As we've seen now, most of these applications that our customers are actually using are now not living in their data center.
55; ;00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:13,240; ;They're outside the data center in a public cloud or in some hosted location.
56; ;00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:21,580; ;So you have to take a look at that and say "is that the most effective model for my customers or employees to access the applications?".
57; ;00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:30,860; ;We're introducing most latency, more hops on the network; so Cloud-Ready Network addresses the inefficiencies of that model.
58; ;00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:48,280; ;Where our applications live today may not be in the data center; it allows us to reduce the cost of the network circuits, introduce items like virtualization and enhanced security, because now again those applications are no longer in the data center.
59; ;00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:50,260; ;So how would that benefit a customer?
60; ;00:06:50,260 --> 00:07:01,340; ;A couple of key areas: so number 1, it introduces agility, so now they can integrate third party platforms, they can introduce new applications and services more quickly.
61; ;00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:05,360; ;It means faster time to market, which is a competitive advantage.
62; ;00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:12,920; ;It's highly scalable, you've now eliminated the dependency on the data center, so now you have a more scalable model.
63; ;00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:20,960; ;It's highly secure, because we're going to introduce new technologies that allow us to have visibility into every application flow.
64; ;00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:29,260; ;It's highly available, and most important it takes cost out of not only the network, but the operations of that network.
65; ;00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:39,060; ;So we're going to walk through each area of Cloud Ready Network and talk about how we differentiate Cisco against our competition, and what benefits our customers can derive.
66; ;00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:46,580; ;On the left-hand side of this diagram, you see an as-is customer's architecture for the consumer side.
67; ;00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:57,340; ;The branch and campus were usually built on a wired first model, meaning that if you wanted to access services, be it voice or data services, you would plug physically into switchboards.
68; ;00:07:57,340 --> 00:08:04,500; ;If there was a wireless network, it was usually there to prevent wireless access, maybe a tattle tale network.
69; ;00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:10,480; ;Also it never had the capabilities that you had on a wired port, that prevented BYOD.
70; ;00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:21,200; ;So I was able to access wireless network in some situations, but I did not have the same capabilities on a wireless network that I had on a wired network.
71; ;00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:33,780; ;There was a lot of manual configuration and a lot of [unintelligible] on these, so once you had a network defined and I needed to move from one location to another there was usually some manual intervention.
72; ;00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:46,180; ;All of those locations access the data center through private lines, and again those were either MPLS circuits, or private circuits from a carrier, usually home run back to a data center.
73; ;00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:52,460; ;So if we look at the proposed to-be state, that's based on DNA.
74; ;00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:59,160; ;DNA we've been selling here at Cisco for a couple of years, and it continues to get better, it is our differentiation.
75; ;00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:06,700; ;In DNA, we offer things like enhanced security; it's integrated into the network, we use the network as a sensor.
76; ;00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:13,940; ;It provides a seamless policy between wired and wireless connectivity, so now I can support BYOD.
77; ;00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:20,280; ;I can provide the same services on a wireless network that I did on a wired network.
78; ;00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:27,420; ;We're able to automate, automate the configuration and change management; it's intent-based.
79; ;00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:34,100; ;It's very open and programmable, and we have proactive assurance.
80; ;00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:41,540; ;So in other words we're able to launch new services and capabilities into these locations much more quickly than we had been in the past.
81; ;00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:46,944; ;So lots of agility here; DNA is our advantage.
82; ;00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:54,380; ;If we take a step further along that communication path, we're introducing a technology called Secure Agile Exchange.
83; ;00:09:54,380 --> 00:10:03,460; ;In this model, you see that consumers and the providers of the applications are becoming more distributed.
84; ;00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:09,160; ;And because of that our customers have to be more open to the Internet.
85; ;00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:12,720; ;And be able to access those applications outside of the data center.
86; ;00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:27,580; ;What Secure Agile Exchange provides is a model to address that in both a private, hybrid and a public cloud, and introducing security and network capabilities in a way that we haven't been able to do before.
87; ;00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:39,520; ;In the past, most of those communication paths were built on physical devices, having to hand stitch all of these together either through physical wires or virtual wires, but it was highly complicated and each was unique.
88; ;00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:48,320; ;With Secure Agile Exchange, we're able to virtualize all of those services on traditional X 86 platforms; specifically at Cisco it's the CSP2100.
89; ;00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:54,980; ;But we're able to virtualize network services, like WAN optimization, routing capabilities through IOS...
90; ;00:10:54,980 --> 00:11:05,824; ;And then all the security capabilities that might be needed for that communication flow, including third party applications because we understand that some of our customers need to have that openness.
91; ;00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:20,816; ;But SAE is an advantage: this can be hosted either in a private data center as a next-generation DMZ there, or in a colocation facility, carrier neutral facility, or IS situation as well.
92; ;00:11:20,810 --> 00:11:28,080; ;So it's highly flexible and you can put this where you need it, where your customers see the best advantage for them.
93; ;00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,904; ;So what makes it special?
94; ;00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:43,760; ;The differentiation in SAE are service chains, and service chains are a way to identify an application flow based on a user or an endpoint, and then the provider of that application.
95; ;00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:51,568; ;And what we do is we break down each of those flows into trusted, semi-trusted and untrusted locations.
96; ;00:11:51,620 --> 00:12:01,960; ;So if we take an example, for instance, the onsite employee; an onsite employee is a trusted person and that person is going to access an application, so we're going to walk through that.
97; ;00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:08,740; ;So that application might need some sort of WAN acceleration, some application acceleration to make it more efficient on the network.
98; ;00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:14,840; ;I might need some identity services to guarantee that that is an employee and they have access to the network.
99; ;00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:20,180; ;But then let's say they're accessing an application that might live in the data center.
100; ;00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:28,900; ;In the data center we might offer some kind of load-balancing capabilities, some firewalling capabilities, or some routing capabilities as we enter into the data center to access that server.
101; ;00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:36,820; ;That's a trusted communication path, so that's a service chain; we might be able to apply that same service chain to multiple applications.
102; ;00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:45,380; ;If that same customer, that same employee, wanted to access let's say a SAS application, Office 365.
103; ;00:12:45,380 --> 00:13:02,100; ;You would have the same service chain for the consumer side, but on the provider side now we might run through the same types of load-balancing services, but we might need let's say DLP services and look at data loss prevention, maybe put it through some sort of web proxy.
104; ;00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:08,980; ;Possibly a semi-trusted firewall connection, and then an untrusted network on the back side which might be Office 365.
105; ;00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:16,660; ;But again providing very prescriptive flows based on applications, consumers, and providers.
106; ;00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:29,740; ;The neat thing about this is now you can spin these chains up very quickly in a virtualized model, test it and roll it into production without significant down time and scheduled maintenance.
107; ;00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:38,940; ;This is very critical to customers because they're able to quickly onboard new partner connections, new applications that might live outside the data center.
108; ;00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:44,600; ;So this gives them a tremendous amount of flexibility and agility they haven't had in the past.
109; ;00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:47,264; ;So let's walk one step further.
110; ;00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:57,800; ;If we look at one of the key areas that we're introducing into the cloud-ready network is the ability to leverage colocation and facilities, or carrier neutral facilities.
111; ;00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:10,660; ;Carrier neutral facilities are locations where you have carrier independent connections coming in, and most of our SAS providers are past providers have connections directly into those locations as well.
112; ;00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:12,100; ;So what does that give to our customer?
113; ;00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:22,460; ;It gives them reduced expenses on network cost; that's key because again those are the areas that we're going to use to help fund network refresh.
114; ;00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:33,220; ;In a carrier neutral facility, you have the ability to one hop away from any application, be it in my data center or off my network.
115; ;00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:37,120; ;You're able to lower cost by accessing cheaper bandwidth.
116; ;00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:45,460; ;And I'll give you an example: we had one customer who had a 1GB circuit costing them on average $10,000 a month.
117; ;00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:47,760; ;And that was to bring that back to their data center.
118; ;00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:58,800; ;In a "Co-Lo" model, no longer was they having to bring that circuit all the way back, they were actually only paying a $250 cross-connect fee.
119; ;00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:11,000; ;So 10,000 to 250, and I know that's a really extreme example, but you can start thinking and let's just say if you cut the cost in half of what they're paying on some of these circuits, how much could that contribute to the bottom line.
120; ;00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:17,280; ;So it's a big deal because now you're paying for cross connects, you're not bringing circuits all the way back to your data center.
121; ;00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:20,620; ;As a matter of fact, the data center becomes what we call a cul-de-sac.
122; ;00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:27,900; ;What does that mean? That means you only go to the data center if you need to access an application that resides in that data center.
123; ;00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:40,640; ;Because all applications might not be hosted in the cloud, so those applications are left in your data center but you only traverse the network to the data center if you have to.
124; ;00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:42,760; ;That allows a couple of key benefits for customers.
125; ;00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:50,660; ;Number 1: it's driving data center consolidation, so maybe instead of having 4 or 6 data centers you can consolidate to half of that.
126; ;00:15:50,660 --> 00:16:05,520; ;That reduces real-estate cost, and it also reduces a lot of dependencies on circuits in those data centers because now you're not taking all traffic, driving it through a data center just to access to some sort of hosted connection on the Internet.
127; ;00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:11,160; ;So Cloud Ready network takes into account carrier neutral facilities.
128; ;00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:22,060; ;One other benefit of carrier neutral is application delivery is much faster, because now you can onboard and offer those up without having to provision everything through the data center.
129; ;00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:35,280; ;So again, alternative forms of transport into the data center, like software-defined WAN, but also much easier access to bandwidth and off net applications.
130; ;00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:39,200; ;So the last stop is in the data center, what are we doing different there?
131; ;00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:45,360; ;Cloud-Ready Network takes into account some of the penny points we've had in traditional network builds.
132; ;00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:57,000; ;So data centers have always been built with a core aggregation access model, whether that was traditional catalyst switches back in the day, or now based on the Nexus product line.
133; ;00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:08,780; ;But those were highly labor intensive; you had a lot of manual configuration, if you moved devices from one port to another you had to change configurations to accommodate that.
134; ;00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:18,880; ;It had limited scalability because it was a 3 tiered model; and it was very complex, so what you ended up doing was decreasing agility.
135; ;00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:26,720; ;What we're introducing on the right-hand side in the to-be state, we're leveraging ASAP, which is our advantage.
136; ;00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:42,860; ;ASAP leverages application-centric architecture, ACI, and it has a high degree of automation through ACI, real-time analytics are embedded, we're using tetration for assurance and segmentation.
137; ;00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:50,280; ;It is system-oriented, it is intent-based; it is also much more simple, much more simple.
138; ;00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:55,960; ;And if you look, it's a spine leaf design, it's no longer a three tier design so it's highly scalable.
139; ;00:17:55,960 --> 00:18:02,920; ;So what does that equate to? Speed, agility, and highly secure.
140; ;00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:10,080; ;All three things are benefits that we need our customers to take advantage of in their networks.
141; ;00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:13,720; ;So in closing I want to go back to the original starting point.
142; ;00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:22,160; ;CRN is a blueprint, it's a way that we can introduce these capabilities; end-to-end architecture, leveraging what's on the truck today
143; ;00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:29,020; ;We're not introducing any new concepts, we're leveraging what you can sell today, what you've been selling today.
144; ;00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:32,840; ;But it's a vision of how you put it all together, how you tie this together.
145; ;00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:39,440; ;It's real, so real products, real validated designs, our partners can sell it, our partners can install it.
146; ;00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:47,940; ;And it's our advantage, a competitive advantage; it's a platform approach, it's totally different than a product versus product approach.
147; ;00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:59,420; ;Bottom line: it delivers customers higher revenue and profitability, and it helps us refresh the network. Thank you.
1; ;00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:08,260; ;Hi, my name's Ian Rutherford.
2; ;00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:13,920; ;I'm the vice president responsible for IT transformation in Global Enterprise Segment.
3; ;00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:30,580; ;Today I'm going to talk to you about how we drive value both for our clients and for Cisco as a result of network transformation and network as a platform that was described by Graham in the technology segment earlier.
4; ;00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:33,260; ;So value is about two things.
5; ;00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:42,640; ;It's about driving business outcomes for our clients and how we can take cost out over a sustained period of time for them.
6; ;00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:55,820; ;And from a Cisco perspective, it's how we get into a relationship with our clients where we can see revenue over a sustained period of time and we can see commitments from the client over a sustained period of time.
7; ;00:00:55,820 --> 00:01:02,080; ;Rather than single transactional interfaces that we have with them day to day.
8; ;00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:12,940; ;So this is about platform economics and how we put propositions together that make our clients see value in making long term commitments with Cisco.
9; ;00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:17,320; ;So why should our clients talk to Cisco at all in the first place?
10; ;00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:26,900; ;From a business perspective, our clients are trying to do very different things today and tomorrow from what they've done in the past.
11; ;00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:32,760; ;Yes they want speed and yes they want cost out and yes they want security.
12; ;00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:44,540; ;But when we look at the way they spend money from a technology perspective today and how we expect it to continue going forward, it's very different from how they've spent it in the past.
13; ;00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:48,620; ;Where we're seeing the spend today is around 3 category areas.
14; ;00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:57,380; ;Around applications, around development platforms, and around systems architecture and systems capability.
15; ;00:01:57,380 --> 00:02:02,500; ;And they're making those spend decisions for very, very specific reasons.
16; ;00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:05,080; ;So let's take some examples.
17; ;00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:09,000; ;So I'll start with the retail client Argos in the UK.
18; ;00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:16,880; ;They made a decision they need to substantially change the way they spend their capital.
19; ;00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:24,720; ;Both from a store's perspective but also for how they can access the internet and how they can provide those products globally.
20; ;00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:29,680; ;To do that, they needed to make fundamental changes in that application spend.
21; ;00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:46,540; ;And they made decisions to go with IBM, looking at how they invest and how they track stock, how they can control stock and how they can catalog that and place it onto the internet to make it available to compete with Amazon and other providers.
22; ;00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:49,560; ;So very much a software as a service.
23; ;00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:55,180; ;Same case with AllianceBernstein, the capital of capital providers in the U.S.
24; ;00:02:55,180 --> 00:03:01,180; ;They made a decision to go with Salesforce for all of their advisors in the U.S.
25; ;00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:11,000; ;And again they chose a software as a service platform so they could quickly move their advisors onto those new platforms and become productive quickly.
26; ;00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,040; ;Let's take another example with BP.
27; ;00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:29,060; ;They made the decision that they wanted to have much more rapid capability to develop applications and they were going to a lot of that application development internally, with the vast amounts of data that you'd expect an oil and gas company like BP to have.
28; ;00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:33,760; ;And they made decisions to invest in Azure, a development platform.
29; ;00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:47,340; ;And they made decisions to invest in AWS as a serving platform to actually enable those applications and that data to be served out both to themselves but also to their providers and their customers.
30; ;00:03:47,340 --> 00:04:00,560; ;So those 3 examples are clients making very specific point investments, some at very very large scale, to make fundamental differences to how they operate.
31; ;00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:04,900; ;But why would they talk to Cisco about networks?
32; ;00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:16,660; ;And the first place that we need to look is where the spend is made today with Cisco, which is with our IT counterparts, both the CIO, CTO and network engineering organizations.
33; ;00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:25,560; ;Today our mode of operation with many of those clients does look at things such as risk and cost and speed.
34; ;00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:32,880; ;But maybe some of those decisions are not made in the way that we would think are most beneficial to that business need that we just talked about.
35; ;00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:38,420; ;So for example, they will sweat assets to try and drive down capital spend.
36; ;00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:45,220; ;They will make decisions about multivendor in order to get best of breed or best in class.
37; ;00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:56,560; ;Or in the case of security as we see, very often they will have a complete variety of different providers where they will pick only the best in class in each particular product segment.
38; ;00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:01,060; ;And the result is that network solution is not very well integrated.
39; ;00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:12,420; ;They do have issues in all of these clients with how they segment that network out, they have issues with security and they have issues with the performance of that system as well.
40; ;00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:25,920; ;So a lot of the history of how IT spend is being made doesn't fit well with what our customers are actually trying to achieve making those major changes that I just talked about.
41; ;00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:38,920; ;So we need to be much more relevant in helping the CTO and the CIO link what they invest in the network side with what the business is demanding on the righthand side of the screen.
42; ;00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:48,200; ;So from a cost perspective, we need to be able to present solutions to our clients that take sustained cost out over a period of time.
43; ;00:05:48,200 --> 00:06:05,020; ;We need to be able to demonstrate that they can connect and they can integrate those solutions from those providers on the righthand side much more easily than they do today and the network does not become a barrier to enabling those solutions to be put in place.
44; ;00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:17,460; ;And last but by no means least, we've got to be able to demonstrate that we can deliver security top to bottom from the cloud and those providers of cloud services all the way down to the consumer at the other end.
45; ;00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:29,600; ;Whether that be an internal user or an external user, that they are fully secured and understood from a network perspective from that connection point all the way to the cloud provision.
46; ;00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:37,160; ;So those are the success factors that we need to join together for our clients to help them be relevant to their business.
47; ;00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:42,460; ;So the network is a fundamental component part of that.
48; ;00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:50,440; ;So how does that actually look from a value perspective, because at the end of the day we need to demonstrate value to our clients.
49; ;00:06:50,440 --> 00:07:02,100; ;So the network as a platform component that Graham has spoken about has got 3 major components that are going to drive out value, which we can demonstrate in a business case.
50; ;00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:06,980; ;Firstly we have the transported self, the physical network.
51; ;00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:18,300; ;We can move our clients from very fixed and very hard to change networks that they have today that are point to point in many cases.
52; ;00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:30,960; ;Through to something that's far more agile, uses different technologies such as the internet, and allows us to configure those changes in a much simpler way, at a much much lower price point.
53; ;00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:49,660; ;We need to apply automation and virtualization as part of that cloud-ready network capability that we have to allow cost to be taken out both in capital, in equipment spend, but also in the operational side of how we actually support and operate that network day to day.
54; ;00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:59,660; ;So those are the 3 big value drivers from a financial perspective that are a big part of that platform economics that I talked about at the beginning.
55; ;00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:12,740; ;But the other part of cloud-ready networks that it enables is a major change in how we move the client from internally delivered applications to external, whether that be private or public.
56; ;00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:24,980; ;But also how we allow proliferation of users to access that network or consumers to access that network in a far more agile way, securely.
57; ;00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:29,860; ;So that's the approach, that's where the value pieces come from.
58; ;00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:33,180; ;Let's actually take a look at a couple of examples.
59; ;00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:40,300; ;So this example was the very first discussion that we had with the CTO of CVS.
60; ;00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:45,380; ;And there was 2 major pieces that put on the table in front of the CTO.
61; ;00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:52,420; ;One was how do we enable you to do 2 things on the lefthand side from an architecture point of view?
62; ;00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:59,800; ;One is to be able to take on acquisitions and mergers, which CVS are a very acquisitive company.
63; ;00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:07,240; ;And how do we enable that change of that network to be integrated much more easily than it was before?
64; ;00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:18,860; ;And we proposed a CoLo based system with secure agile exchange as the core so that we can actually control how data centers are put onto the network.
65; ;00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:22,060; ;And the other thing they wanted to do is take much more advantage of the cloud.
66; ;00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:35,660; ;So how could we allow them to connect to the cloud in a more cost-effective way but also to be able to do that in hours and minutes rather than days and weeks of a traditional engineering set of connectivity.
67; ;00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:43,020; ;And how do we allow that access from a user perspective or consumers up into that network?
68; ;00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:46,220; ;So that was the platform strategy that we proposed.
69; ;00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:54,380; ;But we've also delivered our point of view of where we think the benefits could come from for a value perspective in a financial case.
70; ;00:09:54,380 --> 00:10:02,300; ;And don't forget in this case, as it was the first meeting, we had no data around that client's spend; or we thought we didn't.
71; ;00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:12,520; ;The reality was we had a good idea and a good understanding of their technology spend based on what they've spent with Cisco and what other third parties we know they have.
72; ;00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:18,540; ;We had a good understanding of how the network was configured from a transport perspective, so we could estimate that.
73; ;00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:27,220; ;And as they were internally delivering the operational side, we could actually estimate quite accurately where their staffing spend was as well.
74; ;00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:33,520; ;So as we took them through the picture from a financial point of view, we were able to paint a picture that said:
75; ;00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:52,840; ;Let's take the guard and the model on the very lefthand side of that financial model, which shows where the network spend forms part of total IT spend, break that out to the relevant components that we see that we can impact as a result of our transformation on the lefthand side.
76; ;00:10:52,840 --> 00:11:07,580; ;What those components are whether it be transport, operations, third parties, or technology itself and where we saw those major components of spend saving to deliver an outcome on the righthand side in the 2B.
77; ;00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:20,180; ;And that was a major step in helping the client understand that in fact transformation not only delivers a capability, it also delivers a sustained value to them as well.
78; ;00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:28,860; ;Let's take another case from a major account, because it's not just our largest enterprise customers that can adopt this kind of approach.
79; ;00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:42,480; ;The reality is all of our clients from an enterprise perspective, whether they are commercial, whether they're major accounts, or whether they're large enterprises have spend in the exact same form that I've just described.
80; ;00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:52,460; ;It's operational spend in terms of transport and day to day support and it's capital spend in terms of technology and software.
81; ;00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:58,840; ;And in each case we can look at those component parts and see where we can drive value for our client.
82; ;00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:05,660; ;Even our service providers, at the end of the day they deliver services to their customers who are enterprises.
83; ;00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:16,200; ;And that enterprise customer at the end of that service provider is still trying to make changes, sustained value changes to how they deliver services to their users.
84; ;00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:33,680; ;And in this case with Navy Credit, we were able to show them how automation and virtualization over a plan of 18 to 24 months would make a sustained difference to their support charges but also give them capabilities that they didn't have before.
85; ;00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:42,140; ;And as you'll probably notice in this case, because it's a smaller account there wasn't the benefits around the transport spend because their transport was actually fairly small.
86; ;00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:53,800; ;So we'll see differences from account to account and from client type to client type, but the reality is each of those spend categories we can look at as we go through them.
87; ;00:12:53,800 --> 00:13:03,100; ;So let's spend some time and take a look at the tools that we have to help create that value case for our clients.
88; ;00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:05,580; ;Let's start with what we do know.
89; ;00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:13,760; ;We know exactly what our clients have spent with us over the previous 3, 4, 5 years.
90; ;00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:24,020; ;And as a result of that we can take that data, whether it be from our financial systems or whether it's from our AS services such as SmartNet.
91; ;00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:42,700; ;And we can build a picture very quickly around not only what is deployed in the field but also where we see the technologies that are aging and where we see that aging occurring both in terms of the business, the location of it and the timing of it.
92; ;00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:51,120; ;So that gives us a very good first impression of where that spend is from a technology and capital perspective.
93; ;00:13:51,120 --> 00:14:02,720; ;But it also allows us to hone down our proposition to say well maybe what we should be doing with our client is looking at the areas where we can have the maximum impact in the shortest amount of time.
94; ;00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:16,920; ;So in this particular example we've taken a view of 2019 as being the area where we'd want to make the most significant changes to their network and we can very quickly assess the cost of that spend as it is today.
95; ;00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:27,380; ;And as we apply the cloud-ready network transformation to it, we can build out a view of what that cost will be in the 2B state once transformation is completed.
96; ;00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:35,340; ;So that base of technology spend is an important category of the 3 categories of spend that we're going to look at.
97; ;00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:38,740; ;The second category is around the transport itself.
98; ;00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:49,260; ;So this is taking exactly the same profile of locations but instead it's looking at the access costs from a transport perspective.
99; ;00:14:49,260 --> 00:15:06,560; ;We have access to a global database of all spend for every carrier that will tell us the exact costs from a market perspective of what a link would be from location A to location B based on a certain capacity.
100; ;00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:28,360; ;And we can see each case where that spend is and we can see the areas where we would look to address some of the technology changes such as software defined networking, or putting in a CoLo location and maybe using fiber cross connects to connect that client to the cloud rather than putting in expensive links.
101; ;00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:42,520; ;And here's a case where we can look at a data center today, we can look at the network links that are connected to it, we can assess the cost of it, and we can take a view of how we would build out a 2B view using the cloud-ready approach.
102; ;00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:48,380; ;So that's a second area of spend category that's important for us to look at and to know.
103; ;00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:58,020; ;But what we need to know to start with is where are the locations and where are the circuits that join those locations together and the capacity of them.
104; ;00:15:58,020 --> 00:16:03,140; ;So we start to assemble that into an overall construct of the business case.
105; ;00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:13,140; ;And what you'll see is out of the spend categories that are on the lefthand side building out the as-is, there are certain things that we know such as the technology as I've just described.
106; ;00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:20,940; ;There are things that we can assume and calculate such as the transport costs in the way I just spoke about.
107; ;00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:36,880; ;But the third area which is probably the hardest for us to do is actually assessing the other operational spend which is typically the support charges, which would be from either third parties or from the staffing that is delivered by the client internally.
108; ;00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:52,300; ;And we can make assumptions and we can make assessments of what we think that spend would be by comparing this particular client with a large reference database that we have of other clients of similar size and the spend that they have.
109; ;00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:54,840; ;And we can put that into quartiles.
110; ;00:16:54,840 --> 00:17:06,000; ;We can also use Cisco IT and compare our client to Cisco IT spend and take a view of whether this client would be as efficient or less efficient than we do it ourselves.
111; ;00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:14,200; ;And that allows us to start to build out a complete view of all the spend for that particular client.
112; ;00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:32,260; ;Once we've got our solution together, we can actually package that complete solution up to our client and show them not only a cash based or a PNL based view of that value, we can also show them exactly how each architecture affects each category of spend.
113; ;00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:42,380; ;So in this particular case on the bottom lefthand side I'm showing the secure agile exchange as a technology being deployed into an [unintelligible] CoLo location.
114; ;00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:52,900; ;And the resulting spend savings in the bottom middle section showing where the spend is coming from that's actually going to save money over the long term.
115; ;00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:59,220; ;So it's both in terms of support charges because it's a virtualized platform and automated.
116; ;00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:11,740; ;It's in the technology itself as a result of virtualization and it's also in the transport charges as we move from point to point connections to fiber cross connects for example.
117; ;00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:20,400; ;And then on the bottom right, we can show each of those spend categories and where the investments are going in and where the costs are coming out over time.
118; ;00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:37,320; ;If we've made assumptions, we can also put those assumptions up on the top righthand side and show our confidence level as to how closely we think we've got those numbers and how accurate we think that solution is based on our understanding of the client.
119; ;00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:54,760; ;And this is a great way of being able to package the whole proposition together and demonstrate to the client how we're impacting every spend category, every investment and every outcome to give the client a complete value statement at the end of the day.
120; ;00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:56,760; ;So let's bring this all together.
121; ;00:18:56,760 --> 00:19:07,260; ;We talked at the beginning about how network as a platform delivers economics which delivers benefit both to our customers and to Cisco.
122; ;00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:13,180; ;Let's take an example of HSBC, a large global retail in investment bank.
123; ;00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:19,520; ;They wanted Cisco to provide a new network service for all of their users globally.
124; ;00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:33,160; ;Which not only reduced cost, but delivered capabilities to allow them to deliver new services to their clients. particularly around mortgage advice to their customers in their branch network.
125; ;00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:45,600; ;The result was that we were able to commit an 18% cost reduction on their existing spend of network services and deliver that within 18 months of us putting the system in.
126; ;00:19:45,600 --> 00:20:03,620; ;Not only that, from a mortgage perspective the ability to put their mortgage advisors in the contact center rather than in their branch network allowed them to drive up their appointment rate through greater utilization and also allowed them to increase their revenue as a result.
127; ;00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:09,240; ;And deliver sustained unit cost reduction of their mortgage sales.
128; ;00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:11,240; ;What did it mean for Cisco?
129; ;00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:20,620; ;From a Cisco perspective, Cisco was able to enter into a long term sustained agreement with HSBC over a period of 5 years.
130; ;00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:34,100; ;With Cisco and our partners looking at delivery of product, services, enterprise licensing agreements and all of the capabilities that our partners deliver to our clients.
131; ;00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:47,580; ;This is a great example of network as a platform and platform economics and this is the way that we want to bring sustained benefit both to our clients and to Cisco.
132; ;00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:49,580; ;Thanks very much.
1; ;00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:08,260; ;Hi, my name's Ian Rutherford.
2; ;00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:13,920; ;I'm the vice president responsible for IT transformation in Global Enterprise Segment.
3; ;00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:30,580; ;Today I'm going to talk to you about how we drive value both for our clients and for Cisco as a result of network transformation and network as a platform that was described by Graham in the technology segment earlier.
4; ;00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:33,260; ;So value is about two things.
5; ;00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:42,640; ;It's about driving business outcomes for our clients and how we can take cost out over a sustained period of time for them.
6; ;00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:55,820; ;And from a Cisco perspective, it's how we get into a relationship with our clients where we can see revenue over a sustained period of time and we can see commitments from the client over a sustained period of time.
7; ;00:00:55,820 --> 00:01:02,080; ;Rather than single transactional interfaces that we have with them day to day.
8; ;00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:12,940; ;So this is about platform economics and how we put propositions together that make our clients see value in making long term commitments with Cisco.
9; ;00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:17,320; ;So why should our clients talk to Cisco at all in the first place?
10; ;00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:26,900; ;From a business perspective, our clients are trying to do very different things today and tomorrow from what they've done in the past.
11; ;00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:32,760; ;Yes they want speed and yes they want cost out and yes they want security.
12; ;00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:44,540; ;But when we look at the way they spend money from a technology perspective today and how we expect it to continue going forward, it's very different from how they've spent it in the past.
13; ;00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:48,620; ;Where we're seeing the spend today is around 3 category areas.
14; ;00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:57,380; ;Around applications, around development platforms, and around systems architecture and systems capability.
15; ;00:01:57,380 --> 00:02:02,500; ;And they're making those spend decisions for very, very specific reasons.
16; ;00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:05,080; ;So let's take some examples.
17; ;00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:09,000; ;So I'll start with the retail client Argos in the UK.
18; ;00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:16,880; ;They made a decision they need to substantially change the way they spend their capital.
19; ;00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:24,720; ;Both from a store's perspective but also for how they can access the internet and how they can provide those products globally.
20; ;00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:29,680; ;To do that, they needed to make fundamental changes in that application spend.
21; ;00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:46,540; ;And they made decisions to go with IBM, looking at how they invest and how they track stock, how they can control stock and how they can catalog that and place it onto the internet to make it available to compete with Amazon and other providers.
22; ;00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:49,560; ;So very much a software as a service.
23; ;00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:55,180; ;Same case with AllianceBernstein, the capital of capital providers in the U.S.
24; ;00:02:55,180 --> 00:03:01,180; ;They made a decision to go with Salesforce for all of their advisors in the U.S.
25; ;00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:11,000; ;And again they chose a software as a service platform so they could quickly move their advisors onto those new platforms and become productive quickly.
26; ;00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,040; ;Let's take another example with BP.
27; ;00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:29,060; ;They made the decision that they wanted to have much more rapid capability to develop applications and they were going to a lot of that application development internally, with the vast amounts of data that you'd expect an oil and gas company like BP to have.
28; ;00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:33,760; ;And they made decisions to invest in Azure, a development platform.
29; ;00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:47,340; ;And they made decisions to invest in AWS as a serving platform to actually enable those applications and that data to be served out both to themselves but also to their providers and their customers.
30; ;00:03:47,340 --> 00:04:00,560; ;So those 3 examples are clients making very specific point investments, some at very very large scale, to make fundamental differences to how they operate.
31; ;00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:04,900; ;But why would they talk to Cisco about networks?
32; ;00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:16,660; ;And the first place that we need to look is where the spend is made today with Cisco, which is with our IT counterparts, both the CIO, CTO and network engineering organizations.
33; ;00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:25,560; ;Today our mode of operation with many of those clients does look at things such as risk and cost and speed.
34; ;00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:32,880; ;But maybe some of those decisions are not made in the way that we would think are most beneficial to that business need that we just talked about.
35; ;00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:38,420; ;So for example, they will sweat assets to try and drive down capital spend.
36; ;00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:45,220; ;They will make decisions about multivendor in order to get best of breed or best in class.
37; ;00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:56,560; ;Or in the case of security as we see, very often they will have a complete variety of different providers where they will pick only the best in class in each particular product segment.
38; ;00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:01,060; ;And the result is that network solution is not very well integrated.
39; ;00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:12,420; ;They do have issues in all of these clients with how they segment that network out, they have issues with security and they have issues with the performance of that system as well.
40; ;00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:25,920; ;So a lot of the history of how IT spend is being made doesn't fit well with what our customers are actually trying to achieve making those major changes that I just talked about.
41; ;00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:38,920; ;So we need to be much more relevant in helping the CTO and the CIO link what they invest in the network side with what the business is demanding on the righthand side of the screen.
42; ;00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:48,200; ;So from a cost perspective, we need to be able to present solutions to our clients that take sustained cost out over a period of time.
43; ;00:05:48,200 --> 00:06:05,020; ;We need to be able to demonstrate that they can connect and they can integrate those solutions from those providers on the righthand side much more easily than they do today and the network does not become a barrier to enabling those solutions to be put in place.
44; ;00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:17,460; ;And last but by no means least, we've got to be able to demonstrate that we can deliver security top to bottom from the cloud and those providers of cloud services all the way down to the consumer at the other end.
45; ;00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:29,600; ;Whether that be an internal user or an external user, that they are fully secured and understood from a network perspective from that connection point all the way to the cloud provision.
46; ;00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:37,160; ;So those are the success factors that we need to join together for our clients to help them be relevant to their business.
47; ;00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:42,460; ;So the network is a fundamental component part of that.
48; ;00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:50,440; ;So how does that actually look from a value perspective, because at the end of the day we need to demonstrate value to our clients.
49; ;00:06:50,440 --> 00:07:02,100; ;So the network as a platform component that Graham has spoken about has got 3 major components that are going to drive out value, which we can demonstrate in a business case.
50; ;00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:06,980; ;Firstly we have the transported self, the physical network.
51; ;00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:18,300; ;We can move our clients from very fixed and very hard to change networks that they have today that are point to point in many cases.
52; ;00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:30,960; ;Through to something that's far more agile, uses different technologies such as the internet, and allows us to configure those changes in a much simpler way, at a much much lower price point.
53; ;00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:49,660; ;We need to apply automation and virtualization as part of that cloud-ready network capability that we have to allow cost to be taken out both in capital, in equipment spend, but also in the operational side of how we actually support and operate that network day to day.
54; ;00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:59,660; ;So those are the 3 big value drivers from a financial perspective that are a big part of that platform economics that I talked about at the beginning.
55; ;00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:12,740; ;But the other part of cloud-ready networks that it enables is a major change in how we move the client from internally delivered applications to external, whether that be private or public.
56; ;00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:24,980; ;But also how we allow proliferation of users to access that network or consumers to access that network in a far more agile way, securely.
57; ;00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:29,860; ;So that's the approach, that's where the value pieces come from.
58; ;00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:33,180; ;Let's actually take a look at a couple of examples.
59; ;00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:40,300; ;So this example was the very first discussion that we had with the CTO of CVS.
60; ;00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:45,380; ;And there was 2 major pieces that put on the table in front of the CTO.
61; ;00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:52,420; ;One was how do we enable you to do 2 things on the lefthand side from an architecture point of view?
62; ;00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:59,800; ;One is to be able to take on acquisitions and mergers, which CVS are a very acquisitive company.
63; ;00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:07,240; ;And how do we enable that change of that network to be integrated much more easily than it was before?
64; ;00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:18,860; ;And we proposed a CoLo based system with secure agile exchange as the core so that we can actually control how data centers are put onto the network.
65; ;00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:22,060; ;And the other thing they wanted to do is take much more advantage of the cloud.
66; ;00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:35,660; ;So how could we allow them to connect to the cloud in a more cost-effective way but also to be able to do that in hours and minutes rather than days and weeks of a traditional engineering set of connectivity.
67; ;00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:43,020; ;And how do we allow that access from a user perspective or consumers up into that network?
68; ;00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:46,220; ;So that was the platform strategy that we proposed.
69; ;00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:54,380; ;But we've also delivered our point of view of where we think the benefits could come from for a value perspective in a financial case.
70; ;00:09:54,380 --> 00:10:02,300; ;And don't forget in this case, as it was the first meeting, we had no data around that client's spend; or we thought we didn't.
71; ;00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:12,520; ;The reality was we had a good idea and a good understanding of their technology spend based on what they've spent with Cisco and what other third parties we know they have.
72; ;00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:18,540; ;We had a good understanding of how the network was configured from a transport perspective, so we could estimate that.
73; ;00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:27,220; ;And as they were internally delivering the operational side, we could actually estimate quite accurately where their staffing spend was as well.
74; ;00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:33,520; ;So as we took them through the picture from a financial point of view, we were able to paint a picture that said:
75; ;00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:52,840; ;Let's take the guard and the model on the very lefthand side of that financial model, which shows where the network spend forms part of total IT spend, break that out to the relevant components that we see that we can impact as a result of our transformation on the lefthand side.
76; ;00:10:52,840 --> 00:11:07,580; ;What those components are whether it be transport, operations, third parties, or technology itself and where we saw those major components of spend saving to deliver an outcome on the righthand side in the 2B.
77; ;00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:20,180; ;And that was a major step in helping the client understand that in fact transformation not only delivers a capability, it also delivers a sustained value to them as well.
78; ;00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:28,860; ;Let's take another case from a major account, because it's not just our largest enterprise customers that can adopt this kind of approach.
79; ;00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:42,480; ;The reality is all of our clients from an enterprise perspective, whether they are commercial, whether they're major accounts, or whether they're large enterprises have spend in the exact same form that I've just described.
80; ;00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:52,460; ;It's operational spend in terms of transport and day to day support and it's capital spend in terms of technology and software.
81; ;00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:58,840; ;And in each case we can look at those component parts and see where we can drive value for our client.
82; ;00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:05,660; ;Even our service providers, at the end of the day they deliver services to their customers who are enterprises.
83; ;00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:16,200; ;And that enterprise customer at the end of that service provider is still trying to make changes, sustained value changes to how they deliver services to their users.
84; ;00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:33,680; ;And in this case with Navy Credit, we were able to show them how automation and virtualization over a plan of 18 to 24 months would make a sustained difference to their support charges but also give them capabilities that they didn't have before.
85; ;00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:42,140; ;And as you'll probably notice in this case, because it's a smaller account there wasn't the benefits around the transport spend because their transport was actually fairly small.
86; ;00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:53,800; ;So we'll see differences from account to account and from client type to client type, but the reality is each of those spend categories we can look at as we go through them.
87; ;00:12:53,800 --> 00:13:03,100; ;So let's spend some time and take a look at the tools that we have to help create that value case for our clients.
88; ;00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:05,580; ;Let's start with what we do know.
89; ;00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:13,760; ;We know exactly what our clients have spent with us over the previous 3, 4, 5 years.
90; ;00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:24,020; ;And as a result of that we can take that data, whether it be from our financial systems or whether it's from our AS services such as SmartNet.
91; ;00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:42,700; ;And we can build a picture very quickly around not only what is deployed in the field but also where we see the technologies that are aging and where we see that aging occurring both in terms of the business, the location of it and the timing of it.
92; ;00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:51,120; ;So that gives us a very good first impression of where that spend is from a technology and capital perspective.
93; ;00:13:51,120 --> 00:14:02,720; ;But it also allows us to hone down our proposition to say well maybe what we should be doing with our client is looking at the areas where we can have the maximum impact in the shortest amount of time.
94; ;00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:16,920; ;So in this particular example we've taken a view of 2019 as being the area where we'd want to make the most significant changes to their network and we can very quickly assess the cost of that spend as it is today.
95; ;00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:27,380; ;And as we apply the cloud-ready network transformation to it, we can build out a view of what that cost will be in the 2B state once transformation is completed.
96; ;00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:35,340; ;So that base of technology spend is an important category of the 3 categories of spend that we're going to look at.
97; ;00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:38,740; ;The second category is around the transport itself.
98; ;00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:49,260; ;So this is taking exactly the same profile of locations but instead it's looking at the access costs from a transport perspective.
99; ;00:14:49,260 --> 00:15:06,560; ;We have access to a global database of all spend for every carrier that will tell us the exact costs from a market perspective of what a link would be from location A to location B based on a certain capacity.
100; ;00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:28,360; ;And we can see each case where that spend is and we can see the areas where we would look to address some of the technology changes such as software defined networking, or putting in a CoLo location and maybe using fiber cross connects to connect that client to the cloud rather than putting in expensive links.
101; ;00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:42,520; ;And here's a case where we can look at a data center today, we can look at the network links that are connected to it, we can assess the cost of it, and we can take a view of how we would build out a 2B view using the cloud-ready approach.
102; ;00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:48,380; ;So that's a second area of spend category that's important for us to look at and to know.
103; ;00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:58,020; ;But what we need to know to start with is where are the locations and where are the circuits that join those locations together and the capacity of them.
104; ;00:15:58,020 --> 00:16:03,140; ;So we start to assemble that into an overall construct of the business case.
105; ;00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:13,140; ;And what you'll see is out of the spend categories that are on the lefthand side building out the as-is, there are certain things that we know such as the technology as I've just described.
106; ;00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:20,940; ;There are things that we can assume and calculate such as the transport costs in the way I just spoke about.
107; ;00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:36,880; ;But the third area which is probably the hardest for us to do is actually assessing the other operational spend which is typically the support charges, which would be from either third parties or from the staffing that is delivered by the client internally.
108; ;00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:52,300; ;And we can make assumptions and we can make assessments of what we think that spend would be by comparing this particular client with a large reference database that we have of other clients of similar size and the spend that they have.
109; ;00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:54,840; ;And we can put that into quartiles.
110; ;00:16:54,840 --> 00:17:06,000; ;We can also use Cisco IT and compare our client to Cisco IT spend and take a view of whether this client would be as efficient or less efficient than we do it ourselves.
111; ;00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:14,200; ;And that allows us to start to build out a complete view of all the spend for that particular client.
112; ;00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:32,260; ;Once we've got our solution together, we can actually package that complete solution up to our client and show them not only a cash based or a PNL based view of that value, we can also show them exactly how each architecture affects each category of spend.
113; ;00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:42,380; ;So in this particular case on the bottom lefthand side I'm showing the secure agile exchange as a technology being deployed into an [unintelligible] CoLo location.
114; ;00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:52,900; ;And the resulting spend savings in the bottom middle section showing where the spend is coming from that's actually going to save money over the long term.
115; ;00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:59,220; ;So it's both in terms of support charges because it's a virtualized platform and automated.
116; ;00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:11,740; ;It's in the technology itself as a result of virtualization and it's also in the transport charges as we move from point to point connections to fiber cross connects for example.
117; ;00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:20,400; ;And then on the bottom right, we can show each of those spend categories and where the investments are going in and where the costs are coming out over time.
118; ;00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:37,320; ;If we've made assumptions, we can also put those assumptions up on the top righthand side and show our confidence level as to how closely we think we've got those numbers and how accurate we think that solution is based on our understanding of the client.
119; ;00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:54,760; ;And this is a great way of being able to package the whole proposition together and demonstrate to the client how we're impacting every spend category, every investment and every outcome to give the client a complete value statement at the end of the day.
120; ;00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:56,760; ;So let's bring this all together.
121; ;00:18:56,760 --> 00:19:07,260; ;We talked at the beginning about how network as a platform delivers economics which delivers benefit both to our customers and to Cisco.
122; ;00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:13,180; ;Let's take an example of HSBC, a large global retail in investment bank.
123; ;00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:19,520; ;They wanted Cisco to provide a new network service for all of their users globally.
124; ;00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:33,160; ;Which not only reduced cost, but delivered capabilities to allow them to deliver new services to their clients. particularly around mortgage advice to their customers in their branch network.
125; ;00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:45,600; ;The result was that we were able to commit an 18% cost reduction on their existing spend of network services and deliver that within 18 months of us putting the system in.
126; ;00:19:45,600 --> 00:20:03,620; ;Not only that, from a mortgage perspective the ability to put their mortgage advisors in the contact center rather than in their branch network allowed them to drive up their appointment rate through greater utilization and also allowed them to increase their revenue as a result.
127; ;00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:09,240; ;And deliver sustained unit cost reduction of their mortgage sales.
128; ;00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:11,240; ;What did it mean for Cisco?
129; ;00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:20,620; ;From a Cisco perspective, Cisco was able to enter into a long term sustained agreement with HSBC over a period of 5 years.
130; ;00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:34,100; ;With Cisco and our partners looking at delivery of product, services, enterprise licensing agreements and all of the capabilities that our partners deliver to our clients.
131; ;00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:47,580; ;This is a great example of network as a platform and platform economics and this is the way that we want to bring sustained benefit both to our clients and to Cisco.
132; ;00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:49,580; ;Thanks very much.
1; ;00:00:06,848 --> 00:00:12,672; ;Hi, my name is Graham Vann, I'm the chief technology officer of the global enterprise segment.
2; ;00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:20,224; ;What I'm going to talk about today is an exciting initiative that's part of the Network Intuitive core collaborating networks.
3; ;00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:28,464; ;When we meet with CTO's from our customer's today,  what they tell us again and again is the sheer amount of complexity that they're dealing with.
4; ;00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:32,400; ;Whether this is the huge shift that we're seeing in terms of bandwidth economics,
5; ;00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:35,056; ;because of the connectivity, costs are coming down and down.
6; ;00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:39,024; ;The connectivity options are getting greater and greater within their organization.
7; ;00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:43,232; ;And what we don't see is any shift of that going forwards over time.
8; ;00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:57,200; ;Next we're also dealing with the huge change in their user environment as more and more of their environment evolves towards a mobile-based connectivity model from what has been a fixed, PC-based connectivity model.
9; ;00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:02,960; ;Similarly, more and more of the services that they're looking to provide access to across their networks and within their environment
10; ;00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:09,104; ;are not under their control, but are actually cloud-hosted or SAT-hosted applications.
11; ;00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:13,936; ;The next big challenge they're looking to deal with is what happens when they evolve their networks
12; ;00:01:13,930 --> 00:01:17,888; ;from connecting the tens of thousands of devices that they have today
13; ;00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:26,144; ;to potentially millions of devices as we go forward and start to see this explosion of connectivity as a result of the Internet of Things.
14; ;00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:30,240; ;They're also looking at how they can start to use more and more automation based technology
15; ;00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:34,208; ;to drive out the costs associated with making changes within their environment.
16; ;00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:40,240; ;And to be able to make those changes quicker and to make their network far more agile than it is today.
17; ;00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:44,256; ;And next we're also able to deliver technologies today where we can start to provide
18; ;00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:47,792; ;networking functions on x86 based systems
19; ;00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:52,352; ;which gives us a lot more flexibility to potentially put networking capabilities in places
20; ;00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:55,808; ;that it's never been possible or feasible before.
21; ;00:01:55,800 --> 00:02:00,512; ;Finally what they're looking for is data and information about the way their networks are operating.
22; ;00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:18,944; ;And with the analytics based capabilities that we're starting to increasingly deliver more and more of across our networking platforms, coupled with applications based analytics, we're talking about being able to deliver huge and very, very different insights to the level of visibility they have of their operating environment today.
23; ;00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:21,392; ;Now if we pick off just one of those areas,
24; ;00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:23,696; ;and look at the way that our customers are evolving,
25; ;00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:29,568; ;to the cloud, we've started to see customers evolving to one of three key segments.
26; ;00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:33,952; ;Firstly, on the left hand side, you see the concept of a private first customer.
27; ;00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:39,808; ;This is a customer who is very conservative in their move to cloud-connectivity.
28; ;00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:56,880; ;What they're typically doing is still have their network very much anchored around their private data-centers and they're providing connectivity out to those cloud-based and sass-based services through DMZ's that they've stood up for years within those private data centers, and that's the perimeter of their network.
29; ;00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:06,064; ;But because 95% of their applications and their data still live in their private data centers,  that's the way that they still run and operate the network today.
30; ;00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:13,232; ;If we look down the middle, we see a set of customers who are being far more aggressive in terms of their adoption of cloud-based services.
31; ;00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:21,296; ;These customers are looking to consolidate and close data-centers right the way across their enterprises they're looking to get out to the data-center business.
32; ;00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:24,032; ;What they're looking to with the major cloud providers,
33; ;00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:28,384; ;as a new location for them to move all of their existing applications
34; ;00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:33,168; ;and they want to lift and shift the applications as fast as they can from their existing data-centers
35; ;00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:36,416; ;into these new cloud-hosted locations.
36; ;00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:49,960; ;What we've seen whilst this is a very interesting concept for those customers, once the customers have started on that journey they're running into some consistent obstacles that we're seeing again and again as we engage with those customers in the marketplace.
37; ;00:03:49,960 --> 00:04:02,080; ;One of the biggest issues is these customers have run their enterprises for many years, if not decades, and they run tens and hundreds and thousands of legacy applications within those private data centers.
38; ;00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:15,540; ;the realization that's hitting them is the cost of picking up those applications; lifting and shifting them into these cloud providers is hugely expensive, hugely complex and takes a huge amount of time.
39; ;00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:23,640; ;And for that reason what we're seeing is more and more customers are settling on the model that we see on the righthand side, which is what we call a Cloud First model.
40; ;00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:33,040; ;In the Cloud First model that customer is retaining, albeit a smaller number of their legacy data centers, to maintain and run those key legacy applications.
41; ;00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:44,140; ;But what they're increasingly doing now is starting to embrace the use of the cloud where their developers are going to Cloud First models for the development of new applications and new services.
42; ;00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:49,280; ;That's just why they have their developers working, maybe creating new mobile apps.
43; ;00:04:49,280 --> 00:05:06,640; ;What they're also doing is they are increasingly embracing the use of SaaS spaced applications from companies like Microsoft, Oracle and SAP as the applications from those companies start to be delivered on more attractive consumption models and procurement models going forwards.
44; ;00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:11,800; ;What that means is these customers are inherently now sitting in a hybrid IT environment.
45; ;00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:22,980; ;And the question we have to ask is, is the network that we've always delivered that supports the Private First customer still the right network to support the Cloud First customer?
46; ;00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:31,740; ;If we now come and look at network topology, what we see is that the way that networks have been put together has been remarkably consistent over the decades.
47; ;00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:44,160; ;On the lefthand diagram you see what we would call a DC Centric network architecture, which is the network that's in place for the majority of those Private First customers that we showed on the previous slide.
48; ;00:05:44,160 --> 00:06:01,000; ;They have users that connect to their campus and branches, across wide area networks, connect then into data centers where they have 95% plus of their applications and then connecting directly to those applications which typically run on a fairly static set of servers and mainframes.
49; ;00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:07,660; ;They then have a break out to the internet through a DMZ to provide access to external services.
50; ;00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:15,220; ;this network topology hasn't changed significantly in 30/40 years, in fact all of the time that Cisco's been in existence.
51; ;00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:30,500; ;If we look on the righthand side we believe it's now time for that topology to change and cloud-ready networks is the initiative that has allowed us to now revisit the existing topology and put forward this new cloud-centric network topology to our customers.
52; ;00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:41,960; ;What we see here firstly is, if we look on the lefthand side of this diagram on the righthand side, you see the enormous change that we're starting to see of the consumer environment, of what we're calling now the consumer environment.
53; ;00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:53,260; ;This is being driven by more and more devices being connected, there is more and more users carrying more and more devices and potentially, with the influx of IoT, many many more devices being connected.
54; ;00:06:53,260 --> 00:07:03,440; ;Many of which are being connected not now through wired ports but across wireless technology, so we have lots of mobility and users moving and devices moving around in that space.
55; ;00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:13,740; ;If we come across to the righthand side, we also see significant change in what we call the provider environments and the provider environment is basically where we manage our applications.
56; ;00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:36,800; ;If you look down the righthand side whereas, again, we typically have applications connected directly to servers or mainframes, we've now disaggregated the application environments whereby those applications can now be in the data center, in the cloud-based providers, or in SaaS space providers and they can be across any of those locations all at the same time.
57; ;00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:42,540; ;What this means is there's now huge complexity being introduced also in the provider side of the architecture.
58; ;00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:53,060; ;So to address this, what we've done is introduce the consumer side of the architecture, the provider side of the architecture so that we can address the individual complexities of both of these domains.
59; ;00:07:53,060 --> 00:08:06,380; ;What we also need to introduce in this environment is a new cloud edge location and this is the point purely where we provide connectivity between the consumer side and the provider side of the network.
60; ;00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:18,620; ;Now alongside this evolving topology, we also believe there is the opportunity to introduce a very significant business case to the customer as to why they should look to transform their network in the way that we just described on the previous slide.
61; ;00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:32,500; ;What I'm going to do on this slide is take a walk from the lefthand side to the righthand side of the slide which is going to indicate to you the way in which customers are able to identify key savings as they evolve and go through that network transformation.
62; ;00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:44,180; ;On the lefthand side you see a breakdown of the way that Gardner identified the IT spending stack and the orange portion of that chart identifies the piece that's allocated towards networking.
63; ;00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:59,420; ;If we take one step over from the left we now come to what is an exploded view of that chart and you can see that that spend is predominantly focused on the data network, spending on voice communications and also an element of data center spend is allocated to the network.
64; ;00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:06,060; ;So we're only going after an element, or including an element of the data center spend in this business case.
65; ;00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:16,840; ;If we come one step further over, again to the righthand side, you see a breakdown in terms of the way that the costs for those 3 areas are broken out and it really breaks out into 2 main areas.
66; ;00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:31,520; ;Firstly into the cost of transport, that's the costs that these customers are paying to their large service providers to provide the connectivity to move the data around the network; these are ongoing costs that are paid month by month, year by year by every customer.
67; ;00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:35,960; ;And that represents about 2/3 of the total networking spend.
68; ;00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:40,060; ;If we look at the remaining 1/3 you can see that that comes down to operations.
69; ;00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:46,280; ;And operations divides further, as we come one step over to the righthand side, into 2 buckets.
70; ;00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:55,200; ;The first bucket is spend on Opex operations which is basically tied to the spend associated with keeping the lights on within the environment.
71; ;00:09:55,200 --> 00:10:05,500; ;This is the money that the customer allocates every year for the ongoing maintenance, support and operation of the network and the support stuff within their environment to keep that network up and running.
72; ;00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:13,360; ;We look at the remaining bucket, that's allocated to Capex and that Capex slice is Cisco's equipment spend lives.
73; ;00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:19,980; ;So this where they have budget allocated towards buying equipment to refresh and keep the network up to speed.
74; ;00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:29,700; ;Now that means if you look at Cisco's total spend of the total networking budget, it's a slice of a slice of a slice of the total IT spend.
75; ;00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:42,480; ;However, if we look at the previous topology we highlighted earlier, the cloud-ready network's topology, what you can see now are the bars in the green represent where the cost savings come to the customer as they go through that transformation.
76; ;00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:51,940; ;If we look firstly at the transport costs, we're going to highlight through the remainder of this presentation how a customer can save anything up to 1/3 of those total transport costs.
77; ;00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:59,020; ;And when you consider that that's almost 2/3 of their total networking spend, that's a very significant amount.
78; ;00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:08,900; ;If we come down and look at the operations area we can demonstrate how, by using automation-based technologies, we can reduce the spend in that area by up to 1/3.
79; ;00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:18,800; ;And if we look at the Capex area we can identify how, by using virtualization technologies, we can reduce that by anywhere between 20 and 25%.
80; ;00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:32,720; ;What that means is as we take the next walk over to the righthand side and reconstitute those buckets, what you see is a total saving, when we compare that with the orange buckets on the lefthand side, of anywhere between 25 and 30% for the customer.
81; ;00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:44,180; ;And if we reconstitute that back, take it one more step over to the righthand side into the total IT stack, you can see how that represents anywhere between 3 to 5% of total IT cost savings for the customer.
82; ;00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:56,760; ;These are very very significant amounts which when brought together with the topology change we discussed earlier are very very significant and will grab your customer's attention.
83; ;00:11:56,760 --> 00:12:01,060; ;Now when we talk about topology change what does that really mean in the different places in the network?
84; ;00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:07,960; ;So we spoke earlier about the concept of consumer side and provider side of this new topology or this new architecture.
85; ;00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:13,940; ;What I'm going to do first is take a walk through the transformation we're seeing in the consumer side of the architecture.
86; ;00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:25,960; ;On the lefthand side you see the as-is architectures both for the existing branches and campuses and this is how 90% + of our customers have implemented branch and campus networking within their environments today.
87; ;00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:36,880; ;If we look at the top half of the picture first and just look at branch, what you're gonna see is the transformation we're proposing in the context of an as-is and a to-be architecture.
88; ;00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:48,140; ;when we look at the as-is architecture for branch you can see it's very heavily based around large service provider MPLS infrastructure and as we highlighted in the business case, that's where the majority of the spend is today.
89; ;00:12:48,140 --> 00:13:00,480; ;When we move across to the right, you can see that the physical infrastructure or topology doesn't change significantly but what does change is we're going to start to introduce the use of internet as a transport capability.
90; ;00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:11,540; ;And just the introduction of internet can help drive costs in that environment down very significantly, the technology or the architecture being used there is what we call Software Defined WAN.
91; ;00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:20,340; ;If we now look at the bottom half of this chart, again transformation of the consumer architecture, you can see the changes taking place in the campus environment.
92; ;00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:25,060; ;On the lefthand side you see a typical wired-centric campus.
93; ;00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:33,220; ;The reason we use wired-centric is because the majority of devices in this environment are hardwired to the access layer of the network.
94; ;00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:45,680; ;We will have some wireless within the environment but it's typically used for lower priority connectivity, guest connectivity, printer connectivity; but it's certainly not the predominant connectivity that we use in that  campus environment.
95; ;00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:52,860; ;We're probably connecting about 80% to the devices using wired and only 20% using wireless.
96; ;00:13:52,860 --> 00:14:00,620; ;When we now walk across to the to-be architecture for campus, you can now see we're talking about what we call a wireless-centric office.
97; ;00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:06,980; ;When we start to look at a wireless-centric topology, the first thing you'll notice is a significantly reduced number of switches.
98; ;00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:12,460; ;The reason for that is because we're not hardware connecting as many devices to the network as we were previously.
99; ;00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:29,680; ;But what we will see and you will notice is a significant increase in the amount of wireless connectivity in that environment to reflect the fact that at the access layer of the network we now have up to 80% of the devices now being wirelessly connected as opposed to wire connected.
100; ;00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:37,100; ;Probably some of the greatest transformation we see in terms of the way that the network evolves with a cloud-ready network is in the provider environments.
101; ;00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:43,880; ;And what you see on the lefthand side of the diagram is a traditional data center centric provider network.
102; ;00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:55,640; ;What customers have done is they've built their backbone networks in between their data centers as a high speed network between their data centers, the reason for that is because that's where 95% of the applications reside.
103; ;00:14:55,640 --> 00:15:04,580; ;What you see is they typically build the network with high speed connectivity between redundant data center pairs in different regions around their organization.
104; ;00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:15,680; ;The other thing to notice is they provide all of their external connectivity to cloud, SaaS and internet through those data centers as we identified in the topology diagrams earlier.
105; ;00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:40,140; ;The big change that's happening within the industry is that what we've seen over the last 2 or 3 years is major Colo providers, companies like Equinix have increasingly not only been providing cheap transport connectivity between their sites but they've increasingly been inviting the major cloud SaaSer internet providers into their facilities or they've been locating their data centers very very close to those facilities.
106; ;00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:49,120; ;What that means is we can now question whether, in the diagram on the lefthand side, the data center is still the most appropriate hub point for the network.
107; ;00:15:49,120 --> 00:16:02,760; ;Again when we look at the picture on the lefthand side, all of those cloud, SaaS and internet based lines that you see from that one data center are all lease lined circuits that the customer has to pay bills for to the service provider on a month by month basis.
108; ;00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:20,020; ;When we come across to the righthand side and look at what we call the Colo-centric network architecture, all of the connectivity now to the cloud, SaaS and internet providers is just cheap, cross-connect fiber that is provisioned at very very high speed at very very low cost within the Colo provider themselves.
109; ;00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:35,080; ;What this means is we can now actually move the data centers out as edge nodes on our network, dual home the remaining data centers into those Colo sites and build new virtual background networks between the Colos to constitute our new core.
110; ;00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:42,900; ;We can also now institute much much cheaper connectivity and far higher speed connectivity to the major cloud providers.
111; ;00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:51,900; ;Now to enable this what we also have to do is to provide some key technology within the Colo providers environment to constitute that next generation hub.
112; ;00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:56,880; ;And what you see in the box below is what we call our secure agile exchange.
113; ;00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:14,420; ;This is a very sophisticated set of capabilities that we can put in a single rack in a Colo provider's location which is fully virtualized, fully automated and fully secure which is the connectivity point between the consumer side of the architecture and the provider side of the architecture.
114; ;00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:32,180; ;By implementing secure agile exchange in each of these Colo's locations, we can now build out a next generation core network for the customer with high speed connectivity to cloud, SaaS and internet based  applications that guarantees high speed user experience.
115; ;00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:41,040; ;Just to give one example and double click on that for a second, if you look at the picture on the lefthand side you see the actual topology of a data center centric network.
116; ;00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:49,060; ;In this case you see an East coast and West coast data center pairs connected redundantly in a high speed pair of redundant rings.
117; ;00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:58,420; ;But you see that all of the connectivity to the internet, SaaS and cloud-based services is via hard wired circuits from those data centers.
118; ;00:17:58,420 --> 00:18:08,060; ;Similarly you see the consumer side of the architecture which is typically those existing WAN networks dual homed into those data centers.
119; ;00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:21,300; ;When we move across to the right hand side we look at the bottom half, the first thing to notice is that the consumer networks, those SD WANs that we spoke about earlier, are now actually dual homed into the Colo hub locations.
120; ;00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:32,600; ;Similarly what we've also done is we've reduced the number of data centers because the customer has consolidated data centers as they move applications out to the cloud and start to use more SaaS based connectivity.
121; ;00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:39,400; ;But at the same time all of the internet, cloud and SaaS based connectivity is now directly connected also through those hubs.
122; ;00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:53,720; ;this means that the users in the consumer side of the architecture are only ever one hop either to a legacy application in their existing data centers or to new applications that are now loaded in the internet, cloud and SaaS based environment.
123; ;00:18:53,720 --> 00:19:13,460; ;By implementing this topology, one of the other benefits for the customer is all of their analytics, all of their orchestration, all of their security can now also be implemented in those performance hubs or those hub locations that we have now created within the Colo environments with our secure agile exchange platform.
124; ;00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:27,100; ;If we look at this logically in terms of how this all comes together, really what customers want to do is focus on the top half of this chart and focus far less on the bottom half of this chart and the technologies that we actually implement within their environments.
125; ;00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:41,620; ;What they would really like to do is to be able to build a service intent and policy-driven architecture, have those policies loaded into some sort of automation tool and have that automation tool automatically write those policies down into the network.
126; ;00:19:41,620 --> 00:20:01,560; ;By the same token what they want to do is to have the devices within the infrastructure automatically be able to read from the network through some kind of centralized assurance capability and then be able to export that to the tools that they use to guarantee services, maintain SLAs and guarantee the security of the environment.
127; ;00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:15,180; ;Below the orange line in this chart is where we actually bring together the consumer side architecture we spoke about earlier, the provider side architecture we spoke about earlier and interconnect that through this new cloud exchange environment.
128; ;00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:21,560; ;So being able to bring all of this together we can start to talk about the network now really being delivered to that customer as a platform.
129; ;00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:37,500; ;Because increasingly now all they do is write to the environment, read from the environment and everything underneath the line happens either through automation capabilities or being read from the platform through assurance based technologies and capabilities.
130; ;00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:49,960; ;When we look at the CRN architecture it's also important to highlight the security capabilities and what we've also done is we've taken time to complete the overlay, the complete end-to-end security portfolio across that CRN architecture.
131; ;00:20:49,960 --> 00:21:04,060; ;Whether that's our cloud-based security capabilities at the top of the diagram right the way down to the user access technology that we provide to secure uses and do identity management as they access the network at the bottom of the diagram.
132; ;00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:09,440; ;Key here, however, is the amount of security capability we provide through the middle of this picture.
133; ;00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:21,300; ;Again, because the secure agile exchange is within that architecture, now become the point that every interconnection between the consumer side of the network and the provider side of the network.
134; ;00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:27,700; ;Finally what I wanted to do is to take you through an example of an existing customer who's already on this journey with Cisco.
135; ;00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:40,820; ;Where they started was on the lefthand side, was with a set of separate architectures that they've built out over time using products and technologies from different vendors, using the topology diagram that we spoke about on the very first slide.
136; ;00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:51,220; ;When you look at that in detail you see some of the challenges that that customer has running that environment in reality through having different vendors in each one of those different architectures.
137; ;00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:57,300; ;What they highlighted to us is how difficult they're finding it to run different... to run networking services end-to-end.
138; ;00:21:57,300 --> 00:22:10,860; ;The challenges that they're having in terms of being able to implement features on the products that they buy and the challenges that they have in terms of implementing new services or making repairs or troubleshooting when they have a problem with the network.
139; ;00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:19,240; ;Their aim partnering with us was to start with the end in mind and if you looked at the righthand side, where their focus is is very much around building the network as a platform.
140; ;00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:36,080; ;Based directly on the picture that we showed on the previous slide, they want black boxed operation of the network, predictive maintenance of the environment so that they get predictive information around failures on the network but to get to this point they have to start in the center.
141; ;00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:43,100; ;And so we're in the process with that account team and with that customer at the moment of laying out and implementing this next generation topology.
142; ;00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:49,880; ;Firstly they're building out their end-to-end network which has given us the opportunity to build a wireless-centric environment within their campus and branch.
143; ;00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:59,420; ;Giving us the opportunity to now but ACI in the data centers and we're now putting in the secure agile exchange as the interconnect point between their consumer and provider environment.
144; ;00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:04,180; ;We're also working with that customer right now on a large SD WAN opportunity.
145; ;00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:15,260; ;Once they get to that point where the topology is built, they're now going to be looking at a services oriented network and starting to deliver end-to-end services across the environment and all the benefits that that's going to bring to them.
146; ;00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:18,940; ;But their ultimate endgame is get to network as a platform.
147; ;00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:36,840; ;So Cloud Ready Networks, in summary, is all about helping our customers on this journey using all of the latest trends and technologies we spoke about at the very beginning of the presentation, leveraging the business case to take cost out of the running of the network and evolve to network as a platform.
148; ;00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:40,800; ;Thank you very much for watching this video, I hope it's been really helpful.
1; ;00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:02,940; ;Welcome to this Quick Take Rapid Learning Module.
2; ;00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:09,180; ;Today’s topic: Concessions: How they can destroy – or enhance – your credibility.
3; ;00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:12,670; ;Amber and Leo are negotiating a major equipment lease.
4; ;00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:19,020; ;Amber, the buyer, insists on a big discount, but Leo’s already gone as low as he can go.
5; ;00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:25,820; ;Leo knows Amber is concerned about the equipment becoming obsolete and doesn’t want to lock in to a long-term lease.
6; ;00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:29,880; ;He sees an opportunity to break the logjam with a meaningful concession.
7; ;00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:36,910; ;So he asks his manager if he can modify the terms, making it easier for Amber to get out of the lease early.
8; ;00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:39,050; ;Leo’s manager initially balks.
9; ;00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:41,800; ;He hates giving up guaranteed recurring revenue.
10; ;00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:46,380; ;But seeing no other option, he reluctantly agrees to the concession.
11; ;00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:49,820; ;When Leo brings the offer to Amber, she’s unimpressed.
12; ;00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:52,200; ;In fact, she’s suspicious.
13; ;00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:55,440; ;“Leo understands leases better than I do,” she thinks.
14; ;00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,740; ;“There must be a catch in here somewhere.”
15; ;00:00:57,740 --> 00:01:02,010; ;The discussions go nowhere and Leo fails to get the business.
16; ;00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:04,090; ;In this Quick Take, you will learn:
17; ;00:01:04,090 --> 00:01:11,480; ;Why buyers are likely to dismiss concessions, even when they’re made in good faith and come at considerable cost to the seller.
18; ;00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:23,080; ;Why concessions can undermine a buyer’s trust in sellers, and how to craft and present concessions in a way that will make them more likely to be taken in good faith and reciprocated.
19; ;00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:24,920; ;So what happened with Amber?
20; ;00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:31,440; ;Why would she push back, win a major concession, and still perceive that she was being taken advantage of?
21; ;00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:35,070; ;Is it because Leo is simply a bad communicator?
22; ;00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:36,200; ;Probably not.
23; ;00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:41,080; ;More likely she engaged in a phenomenon called “reactive devaluation.”
24; ;00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:49,790; ;Multiple studies have shown that concessions offered by one party tend to be seen as trivial or even underhanded by the other party.
25; ;00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:54,650; ;Even when those concessions are in fact significant and offered in good faith.
26; ;00:01:54,650 --> 00:02:00,190; ;Reactive devaluation isn’t about the substance of the concession; it’s about the source.
27; ;00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:04,920; ;The concession is devalued simply because it’s coming from the other side.
28; ;00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:16,410; ;In a classic study on reactive devaluation, researchers during the Cold War stopped Americans on the street and described a plan to drastically reduce U.S. and Soviet nuclear arsenals.
29; ;00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:21,160; ;When told that President Reagan had proposed the plan, 90 percent favored it.
30; ;00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:29,200; ;But when others were shown the exact same plan and told that the Soviets had proposed it, only 44 percent favored it.
31; ;00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:36,030; ;Now, it might not surprise you that people would be deeply suspicious of proposals offered by a long-term adversary.
32; ;00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:43,630; ;But researchers have found that reactive devaluation occurs even when people don’t see the other side as sworn enemies.
33; ;00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:53,530; ;For example, a set of studies focused on how students at Stanford University reacted to two proposals the school was considering for its apartheid-related investments.
34; ;00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:58,440; ;The students and administration weren’t enemies; in fact they had the same goal.
35; ;00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:06,240; ;But when researchers asked students to evaluate the investment strategies, the pattern was identical to the U.S.-Soviet study.
36; ;00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:15,280; ;When the students were told that the administration favored one plan over the other, support for it dropped from 85 percent to 40 percent.
37; ;00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:25,900; ;Reactive devaluation has derailed many negotiations – not only in politics, but also in company mergers, divorce settlements and, of course, sales.
38; ;00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:34,650; ;It can leave both sides feeling angry, disrespected and unwilling to make a deal, even when both parties would benefit.
39; ;00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:42,090; ;The good news is that if you understand reactive devaluation and why it happens, you can mitigate its effects.
40; ;00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:44,860; ;Here’s why reactive devaluation happens:
41; ;00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:51,710; ;First, the other party assumes that if you’re willing to offer a concession, it must not be that important to you.
42; ;00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:57,710; ;Second, the other party assumes you know something they don’t, or have a hidden agenda.
43; ;00:03:57,710 --> 00:04:00,750; ;And third is the “grass is greener” effect.
44; ;00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:05,480; ;Multiple studies show that people put a higher value on what they can’t get.
45; ;00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:10,540; ;So as soon as you put a concession on the table, it becomes less valuable.
46; ;00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:17,820; ;There is a way to structure concessions that will maximize the likelihood that they’ll be accepted and reciprocated.
47; ;00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:23,240; ;The key is to give buyers the perception that they’re in control, not you.
48; ;00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:27,150; ;In the example we just described, don’t offer a concession.
49; ;00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:35,400; ;Get the buyer to choose from what researchers call a “menu of concessions” that you provide based on knowledge you’ve gained about their needs.
50; ;00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:43,340; ;You might be thinking, “Wait a minute, why would offering prospects three options rather than one make them less distrustful?”
51; ;00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:46,360; ;It has to do with the way human beings are wired.
52; ;00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:52,960; ;Choices, by their very nature, give people the perception that they’re more empowered and more in control.
53; ;00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:59,290; ;And studies have shown that when people feel more powerful, they become more trusting and more cooperative.
54; ;00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:11,440; ;The key is to listen carefully throughout the sales process for language that you can use later to frame concessions around what the buyer considers valuable, not what you think is significant.
55; ;00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:17,610; ;Here’s how Leo might have framed a menu of concessions for Amber and reduced her level of distrust:
56; ;00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:21,440; ;“Amber, let’s see if we can get you more of what you want in this lease.
57; ;00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:25,580; ;If you can agree to our price, here are three alternatives we can offer.
58; ;00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:30,620; ;I can’t give you all three, of course – but which one would be most valuable to you?"
59; ;00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:35,840; ;One, “You said you didn’t want to get stuck with obsolete equipment and needed a shorter lease term.
60; ;00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:40,140; ;What if I could add a clause saying you can get out after three years?”
61; ;00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:42,160; ;Two, “You mentioned downtime.
62; ;00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:48,780; ;What if we could guarantee service calls within 24 hours, instead of the 72 hours in the standard contract?”
63; ;00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:54,170; ;Three, “You expressed concern about surprise wear-and-tear charges at the end of the lease.
64; ;00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:59,720; ;What if we could increase the allowances for normal wear and tear and eliminate those surprises?”
65; ;00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:02,720; ;Will this approach work every time?  Of course not.
66; ;00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:07,720; ;But offering a menu of concessions can often prevent “reactive devaluation.”
67; ;00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:14,840; ;It empowers prospects, lowers distrust, and increases the odds they’ll make a choice that lands you a sale.
68; ;00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:15,820; ;Thanks for watching.

1; ;00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:03,200; ;Welcome to this Quick Take rapid learning module.
2; ;00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:08,750; ;Today’s topic – How “consumption visions” can help customers sell themselves.
3; ;00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:13,860; ;It’s no secret that inviting buyers to dream can be a powerful sales tool.
4; ;00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:20,060; ;We tell them: Think how much better you’ll sleep after you’ve replaced that old equipment with something new and trouble free.
5; ;00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:25,100; ;Wouldn’t it be great to tell your boss that you came in 20% under budget on this project?
6; ;00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:28,820; ;What will your company be able to do with the money you're saving?
7; ;00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:33,280; ;It’s easy to see how talking up benefits can encourage people to buy.
8; ;00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:40,940; ;But psychological research suggests that something deeper happens when buyers do the talking instead of you.
9; ;00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:47,680; ;When they imagine themselves using your products and services, their intention to buy increases.
10; ;00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:50,040; ;In this Quick Take, you will learn:
11; ;00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:58,880; ;Why “consumption visions” – conversations in which buyers imagine themselves buying and using your product or service – are so powerful.
12; ;00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:09,900; ;Why they’re not just about imagining favorable outcomes and how to help buyers construct consumption visions that will make them more likely to buy from you.
13; ;00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:11,820; ;What is a consumption vision?
14; ;00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:20,420; ;It’s a mental picture that the buyer constructs, in which they imagine themselves “consuming” – that is, using -- your product or service.
15; ;00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:25,540; ;Studies show that these visions can have a powerful influence over intentions.
16; ;00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:31,640; ;To get a better idea of consumption visions and how they work, let’s look at some of the research:
17; ;00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:40,020; ;In one study, done at Penn State University, 129 subjects were asked to imagine themselves on vacation in Aruba.
18; ;00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:47,440; ;The researchers found that the vision increased the subjects’ intention to “consume” the actual vacation experience later on.
19; ;00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:52,560; ;That is, imagining the trip made them more likely to want to take the trip.
20; ;00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:59,280; ;Now, the idea of getting prospects to dream about something as enticing as a week in the sun may seem obvious.
21; ;00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,340; ;But there’s a subtle twist here:
22; ;00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:09,360; ;Other studies have shown that consumption visions aren’t just about imagining pleasurable experiences, or the benefits of what we sell.
23; ;00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:16,460; ;They also involve more mundane behaviors – those that aren’t especially fun and where there’s no clear reward.
24; ;00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:28,100; ;For example, researchers at Rice University had 114 college students draw cartoons of people engaging in various behaviors, including donating blood and getting a job.
25; ;00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:31,400; ;One group was asked to draw themselves doing these things.
26; ;00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:34,920; ;Another group was asked to draw someone else doing them.
27; ;00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:41,620; ;When people drew themselves in the picture, their intentions to give blood or look for a job increased.
28; ;00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:46,820; ;But when they drew someone else, their intentions didn’t change significantly.
29; ;00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:51,440; ;This experiment tells us something about why consumption visions work:
30; ;00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:58,100; ;The researchers concluded that they create a “behavioral script”, which we then apply to our future actions.
31; ;00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:05,500; ;In other words, they help us imagine ourselves engaging in the behavior – which is why we need to be in the picture.
32; ;00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:07,640; ;Another key finding of the research:
33; ;00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:13,640; ;When subjects went back and revisited their consumption visions, their intentions grew even stronger.
34; ;00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:17,880; ;So how can we create consumption visions for our customers?
35; ;00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:23,540; ;In most situations, the place to start isn’t by painting a picture for the buyer.
36; ;00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:27,600; ;Instead, get the buyer to paint his or her own picture.
37; ;00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:33,000; ;It’s important that they themselves articulate the process of “consuming” what you sell.
38; ;00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,460; ;Invite your buyer to tell you how they imagine using your product or service.
39; ;00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:41,640; ;Have them envision the process, not just the outcome.
40; ;00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:44,700; ;For example, you might say something like this:
41; ;00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:50,720; ;“Assuming we end up doing business together, walk me through how you’d be using the product day to day.”
42; ;00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:55,020; ;Or: “Imagine you’ve made your decision and decided to go with our product.
43; ;00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,800; ;Tell me what you’ll do next.”
44; ;00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:01,380; ;The best place to have conversations like these is in discovery.
45; ;00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:03,660; ;There, they serve a dual purpose:
46; ;00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:08,780; ;They help you get inside your customer’s world and understand what they’re dealing with.
47; ;00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:14,440; ;And they help the customer begin to see your product or service as part of their future.
48; ;00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:23,120; ;Since research shows that repetition helps lock in the effect, look for follow-up opportunities to re-engage the customers in their consumption vision.
49; ;00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:34,500; ;For example, when you’re recapping what you’ve learned from discovery, or as you’re preparing to close, invite customers to articulate once again how they envision using your product.
50; ;00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:39,060; ;You can also use consumption visions to advance the sales process itself.
51; ;00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:47,380; ;Encourage your customer to envision themselves not only using your product or service, but the steps involved in actually buying it.
52; ;00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:49,260; ;For example, you might say:
53; ;00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:53,700; ;“Can you describe to me the steps you’ll go through to make your buying decision?”
54; ;00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:57,620; ;Or “You’ve said that your CEO will have to sign off on this deal.
55; ;00:04:57,620 --> 00:05:03,380; ;Take me through what has to happen, from your perspective, in order to get the CEO’s approval.”
56; ;00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:06,460; ;Let’s review what we’ve learned in this Quick Take:
57; ;00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:16,240; ;When people imagine themselves engaging in some behavior – such as consuming your product – their intention to engage in that behavior increases.
58; ;00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:22,140; ;These “consumption visions” aren’t just about the buyer imagining a favorable outcome.
59; ;00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:27,000; ;They’re also about the process of buying and using what you sell.
60; ;00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:33,840; ;Your role isn’t to create a “consumption vision” for buyers, but to help them build their own.
61; ;00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:34,960; ;Thanks for watching.

1; ;00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,880; ;Welcome to this Quick Take Rapid Learning Module.
2; ;00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:10,110; ;Today’s topic: Price resistance: Why talking about features and benefits can undermine your value proposition.
3; ;00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:12,940; ;Here’s a true story of two sales teams.
4; ;00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:14,810; ;Both sold the same product.
5; ;00:00:14,810 --> 00:00:17,370; ;Both called on the same kinds of customers.
6; ;00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:19,900; ;Both had gone through the same product training.
7; ;00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:24,720; ;In nearly every respect but one, the teams were identical.
8; ;00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:29,420; ;Yet one team was getting 30% more price objections than the other.
9; ;00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:30,940; ;Why?
10; ;00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:33,150; ;In this Quick Take, you will learn:
11; ;00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:38,640; ;The one thing salespeople do that almost always increases price resistance.
12; ;00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:49,610; ;Why well-intended efforts to “add value” often backfire, and the right way – and the wrong way – to talk to buyers about features and benefits.
13; ;00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:52,520; ;Why do buyers push back on price?
14; ;00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:54,540; ;Some are just made that way.
15; ;00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:57,040; ;Others don’t have much money to spend.
16; ;00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:04,030; ;But, it turns out, in many cases price resistance has more to do with the seller than with the buyer.
17; ;00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:09,180; ;To see why, let’s take a closer look at those two sales teams we mentioned earlier:
18; ;00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:11,310; ;They were both part of the same company.
19; ;00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:13,980; ;One was the company’s original sales force.
20; ;00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:24,040; ;But after the company started losing sales to a low-price competitor, it hired away some of their top salespeople and set them up as a separate sales force.
21; ;00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:30,080; ;The company was convinced that this second team would significantly outsell the original sales force.
22; ;00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:34,460; ;After all, they’d been doing just that when they’d been working for the competition.
23; ;00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:36,810; ;But that’s not what happened.
24; ;00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:40,990; ;The hot new team closed far fewer sales than the original sales team.
25; ;00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:47,000; ;In fact, they seemed to be driving prospects right into the arms of their former employer.
26; ;00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,540; ;So what happened?
27; ;00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:52,300; ;Call reviews found a critical difference between the two teams:
28; ;00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:57,640; ;The new team was presenting many more features and benefits than the established sales force.
29; ;00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:03,130; ;In their former jobs – where they’d been selling on price – that approach had helped them win sales.
30; ;00:02:03,130 --> 00:02:05,100; ;Now it was working against them:
31; ;00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:10,300; ;The more they talked up these features and benefits, the more price sensitive buyers became.
32; ;00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:15,420; ;So it turned out that the established sales force was actually doing a pretty good job.
33; ;00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:22,480; ;Experience had taught them that a less-is-more approach increased the perceived value of what they were selling.
34; ;00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:27,680; ;So why does that happen? Why do lots of benefits make buyers price sensitive?
35; ;00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:34,220; ;You’d think it would be the other way around: that the more benefits you present, the more a buyer should be willing to pay.
36; ;00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:37,420; ;But that’s not how buyers see value.
37; ;00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:42,890; ;Sales researcher Neil Rackham, who reported this case in his groundbreaking book Spin Selling,
38; ;00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:51,280; ;concluded that buyers don’t judge value by how many benefits are piled on the scale, but by how well these benefits fit.
39; ;00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:58,250; ;In high-value, consultative sales, buyers expect a seller who can create a solution tailored just for them.
40; ;00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:05,320; ;So instead of piling on the benefits, add value – and protect your price -- by improving the fit.
41; ;00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:14,280; ;Specifically, Rackham’s research found that benefits must be linked to a specific need, want or problem that the buyer has expressed.
42; ;00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:23,980; ;For example, if your buyer says, “I need something that does A, B and C,” you add value when you talk about how your product does A, B and C.
43; ;00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:30,800; ;But if you also mention D, E and F, you send a troubling message to your buyer:
44; ;00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:33,370; ;“I don’t really understand your problem.
45; ;00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:42,140; ;I’m proposing something that isn’t exactly what you need —perhaps because I lack confidence that I can actually deliver on A, B and C.”
46; ;00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:46,880; ;Is it any surprise that buyers start looking for a cheaper alternative?
47; ;00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:51,480; ;But wait. What if everybody’s product does A, B and C?
48; ;00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:55,290; ;What if D, E and F are the things that make you special?
49; ;00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:58,400; ;Can you really afford not to mention them?
50; ;00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:04,780; ;This study – as well as other research – suggests that you can still leverage these unique benefits.
51; ;00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:09,200; ;By turning them into questions that uncover additional needs.
52; ;00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:20,890; ;Here’s how: If the customer says she needs A, B and C, resist the temptation to say, “By the way, our product also does D, E and F.”
53; ;00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:25,280; ;Instead, frame a series of questions along these lines:
54; ;00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,820; ;“You said you need A, B and C.
55; ;00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:32,570; ;Just so I truly understand what you’re looking for, let me ask you about D.
56; ;00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:35,690; ;Is that also something that would be important to you?”
57; ;00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:39,880; ;“Well, yes,” the buyer might say, “I suppose it is.”
58; ;00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:42,330; ;“Tell me why,” you reply.
59; ;00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:47,180; ;Then you move on to E and F, using the same approach.
60; ;00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:51,550; ;Questions like these don’t push irrelevant benefits onto a buyer.
61; ;00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:56,030; ;Rather, they prompt buyers to think more deeply about their needs.
62; ;00:04:56,030 --> 00:05:04,940; ;And once you’ve firmly established additional needs, you can then go ahead and discuss the corresponding benefits – because now they fit.
63; ;00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:08,190; ;Keep in mind two caveats with this approach:
64; ;00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:17,470; ;One, don’t put words in the buyer’s mouth, or assume that half-hearted agreement means the buyer really does need D, E or F.
65; ;00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:26,490; ;Probe deeply: You’re looking to identify actual needs, not trying to talk buyers into something you want them to want.
66; ;00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:31,880; ;Two, don’t assume you must find a need related to your unique benefit.
67; ;00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:40,080; ;If the buyer says: “No, none of those things matter; all I really want is A, B and C,” that’s powerful information in its own right.
68; ;00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:46,120; ;Because your less skillful competitors will probably be pushing their irrelevant benefits.
69; ;00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:51,100; ;If you know what your buyer really wants, you won’t make that mistake.
70; ;00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:53,920; ;You’ll offer the solution that fits like a glove.
71; ;00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:57,690; ;And that’s something buyers will pay for.
72; ;00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:00,460; ;Let’s review what we’ve learned today:
73; ;00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:08,780; ;When salespeople present irrelevant features and benefits, price considerations move front and center in the decision-making process.
74; ;00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:19,440; ;You can reduce price objections by taking the time to truly understand what’s valuable to your buyer, and keeping your sales conversations focused on these high-value areas.
75; ;00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:25,790; ;When you’re selling against low-cost competitors, don’t try to outdo them by offering more stuff.
76; ;00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:30,000; ;Outdo them by showing that your solution is the better fit.
77; ;00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,060; ;Thanks for watching.

2; ;00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:07,840; ;Today's topic: Communication: Getting your buyer to see the light.
3; ;00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:10,660; ;Veronica's client, Sam, is furious.
4; ;00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:16,060; ;“Every month, the bill I get from you people is bigger than the one before,” he fumes.
5; ;00:00:16,060 --> 00:00:20,700; ;Veronica's perplexed. The bills have been up a little one month, down the next.
6; ;00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:24,300; ;But overall, they've been steady for the last 12 months.
7; ;00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:29,920; ;Veronica tells Sam, “Maybe I'm missing something, but we haven't increased our average billings.”
8; ;00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:36,020; ;Sam persists. “If you want to keep my business, I expect an adjustment on this bill.”
9; ;00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:39,200; ;The customer is always right, right?
10; ;00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:40,800; ;Please.
11; ;00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,520; ;Sometimes, customers are dead wrong when they say things like:
12; ;00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:53,680; ;“I know for a fact that your products aren't as reliable as Brand X.” Or, “Your product failed.” Or, “We never hear from you.”
13; ;00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:57,000; ;So how do you get a customer to see the light?
14; ;00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,340; ;In this Quick Take you will learn:
15; ;00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:13,320; ;The best way to communicate hard truths to buyers, how to present evidence in a way that's less likely to lead to a debate, and why we communicate better when we speak in the brain's “native language.”
16; ;00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,300; ;Let's get back to Veronica.
17; ;00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:22,720; ;Her sales manager tells her, “Stick to your guns - but don't make Sam mad. His business is important to us.”
18; ;00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:28,620; ;Veronica  is worried that with his emotions running high, Sam won't admit he's wrong.
19; ;00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:30,980; ;She considers three approaches:
20; ;00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:35,420; ;One, review copies of old invoices one by one.
21; ;00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:40,320; ;Two, present a chart showing the billings for the past 12 months.
22; ;00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:49,440; ;Three, build up Sam's self-esteem, praising him for his well-deserved reputation for fairness, before she asks him to review the billings.
23; ;00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:56,180; ;So what's the best way to counter a person who has deeply held, but incorrect beliefs?
24; ;00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:59,360; ;A Dartmouth University study gives us the answer.
25; ;00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:05,160; ;In the experiment, the researchers presented people with facts that contradicted their political views.
26; ;00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:13,000; ;They deliberately chose emotional topics - highly polarizing issues that make people really dig in their heels.
27; ;00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:21,200; ;People who'd opposed President Bush's “surge strategy” in the Iraq war were presented with evidence that the strategy had reduced violence in Iraq.
28; ;00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:30,820; ;And people who disapproved of Barack Obama's handling of the economy were shown evidence showing that jobs had increased during the first year of his presidency.
29; ;00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:35,580; ;The point wasn't to prove anyone wrong or promote a specific political agenda.
30; ;00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:43,200; ;The researchers simply wanted to know what might get people to consider evidence that contradicted their deeply held views.
31; ;00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:49,100; ;When presenting this evidence, the researchers used approaches similar to Veronica's three options:
32; ;00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:51,200; ;Explain the data in words.
33; ;00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:58,540; ;Summarize the evidence in a chart, and build up the buyer's self esteem before presenting the evidence in words.
34; ;00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:03,600; ;The least effective approach? Simply explaining the facts in words.
35; ;00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:07,200; ;Building up the buyer's self-esteem didn't work either.
36; ;00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:12,060; ;The most effective technique was to present the information in a chart.
37; ;00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:13,400; ;But why?
38; ;00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:17,580; ;It has to do with the brain's structure, according to neuroscientists.
39; ;00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:28,140; ;Cognitive researchers suggest that the human brain has evolved in such a way that it's more likely to see visuals as “true” and words as, literally, “debatable.”
40; ;00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:34,320; ;It seems that when evidence is presented in words, our brains tend to view them as part of an “argument.”
41; ;00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:40,160; ;So when that evidence contradicts our beliefs, the brain begins creating counterarguments.
42; ;00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:44,620; ;Present that same evidence visually, however, and we process it differently.
43; ;00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:48,520; ;We see it as “real” in a way that mere words are not.
44; ;00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:53,540; ;It's no secret, of course, that visuals are extremely powerful tools of persuasion.
45; ;00:03:53,540 --> 00:04:04,300; ;A classic study from the University of Minnesota, for example, found that presentations using visual aids are 43% more persuasive than unaided presentations.
46; ;00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:10,360; ;The Minnesota study also found that visuals don't have to be especially striking or provocative.
47; ;00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:16,680; ;Images don't persuade because they're pretty. They persuade because they're in the “native language” of the brain.
48; ;00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:25,480; ;More of the brain's processing power is devoted to visual information, so we understand and remember images better than words.
49; ;00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:38,520; ;What's more, neurological studies show that the brain has to work much harder to process words than pictures, creating more opportunities for the information to be corrupted, manipulated, modified or misunderstood.
50; ;00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:41,700; ;So for Veronica, the best option is clear.
51; ;00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:46,260; ;When she meets with Sam, she doesn't show up with a folder full of old invoices.
52; ;00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:49,440; ;She doesn't try to tell him what a great guy he is.
53; ;00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:56,820; ;She hands him a single chart showing that despite some monthly fluctuations, his bills haven't gone up.
54; ;00:04:56,820 --> 00:05:00,880; ;“Sam,” she says, “you raised some concerns about billing.
55; ;00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:06,780; ;So I put together this chart showing how much we've billed you each month this year versus last year.”
56; ;00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:11,940; ;Then she remains silent and lets the graphics do the explaining.
57; ;00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:14,840; ;Of course, this approach might not always work.
58; ;00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:20,940; ;Sam's complaints about the bills might be a smokescreen for another issue, or a negotiating ploy.
59; ;00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:30,980; ;But he's more likely to be persuaded by a chart than by a conversation over a stack of backup invoices or attempts to make him feel good about himself.
60; ;00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:36,280; ;This research has implications that go beyond correcting a buyer's misperceptions, of course.
61; ;00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:40,520; ;Telling buyers they're wrong is one of the toughest challenges in sales.
62; ;00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:47,440; ;And if visuals can help with that, consider how they can help you persuade buyers in other situations as well.
63; ;00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,720; ;Thanks for watching.

1; ;00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,120; ;Welcome to this Quick Take Rapid Learning Module.
2; ;00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:06,980; ;Today's topic: Overcoming call reluctance.
3; ;00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:10,660; ;These days, there are lots of new ways to reach out to prospects.
4; ;00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:18,960; ;But to establish a connection, qualify a customer and win share of mind, nothing replaces an actual person-to-person phone call.
5; ;00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,420; ;And yet salespeople are still reluctant to make that call.
6; ;00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:27,920; ;According to one survey, 80 percent of new salespeople fail because of call reluctance.
7; ;00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:30,760; ;But this isn't just a problem for new reps.
8; ;00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:38,200; ;In a recent survey of nearly 200,000 salespeople, 90 percent said they experienced some degree of call reluctance.
9; ;00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:43,400; ;Other studies have found it to be the number-one reason for underperformance in sales.
10; ;00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:54,600; ;In this Quick Take, you will learn: the psychological basis of call reluctance, why traditional approaches to dealing with it often backfire and steps you can take to overcome it.
11; ;00:00:54,600 --> 00:01:01,500; ;Call reluctance is so common because it's related to a fundamental human drive: the need for acceptance.
12; ;00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:09,400; ;In situations where we might be judged negatively by others -- for example, giving a speech or applying for a job -- we feel anxious.
13; ;00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:18,600; ;And we feel especially anxious when approaching strangers - as in cold calling -- because we have so little information and can't predict their reaction.
14; ;00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:22,920; ;Of course, nearly everyone experiences this kind of social anxiety.
15; ;00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:29,200; ;It only becomes dysfunctional when it leads to what psychologists call “self-focus attention”:
16; ;00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:36,400; ;When a potential encounter is seen as a threat to our social standing, we can become hyperfocused on what we say and do.
17; ;00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:47,000; ;At the same time, the anxiety causes physical symptoms - a racing heartbeat, shallow breathing, sweaty palms - that focus us even more on ourselves.
18; ;00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:53,260; ;This “self-focus attention” amplifies the initial anxiety and crowds out rational thought.
19; ;00:01:53,260 --> 00:02:03,160; ;It leads to avoidant behaviors - procrastinating, overpreparing, not making the call at all, bailing at the first sign of trouble or not asking for the order.
20; ;00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:07,420; ;Making matters worse, self-focus creates a negative feedback loop:
21; ;00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:19,360; ;Buyers sense the anxiety and perceive the salesperson to be unknowledgeable, unprofessional, self-involved and incapable - which leads to a failed call, which leads to more anxiety in the future.
22; ;00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:26,160; ;When you understand how this feedback loop works, you can see why traditional approaches to call reluctance often fail.
23; ;00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:30,240; ;Threats and promised rewards simply amp up the anxiety.
24; ;00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:35,520; ;Relaxation and meditative techniques keep us focused on our own physical reactions.
25; ;00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:41,580; ;And when we try to visualize a successful outcome, we're still thinking about how we will feel.
26; ;00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:46,040; ;So how do we break this vicious cycle and stop focusing on ourselves?
27; ;00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:51,800; ;One of the best ways, research shows, is by shifting our focus to the task itself.
28; ;00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:59,220; ;Instead of framing the sales call around how well you’re performing, you approach the sales call as a task to be completed.
29; ;00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:05,080; ;That may sound like a tall order. But you don’t have to revamp your entire approach to sales calls.
30; ;00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:13,140; ;It’s more a matter of focus: Create a checklist that breaks the call down into a series of small, discrete tasks or steps.
31; ;00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:18,520; ;As you work through the call, you simply focus on completing the very next step.
32; ;00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:23,320; ;So, for example, when you pick up the phone, you focus on dialing the number.
33; ;00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:31,840; ;Once you’ve dialed the number, you focus on what you’ll say when the prospect answers, or what you’ll do if you reach voicemail or a gatekeeper.
34; ;00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:41,700; ;Research suggests that when you train yourself to work through the call like this – one small step at a time -- you can reduce anxiety and improve your performance.
35; ;00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:50,000; ;One study looked specifically at salespeople and found that a task-focused orientation correlated with more successful sales calls.
36; ;00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:57,280; ;Another study found that a task-focused orientation helps salespeople bounce back after losing a major sale.
37; ;00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:01,980; ;So why does task focus reduce anxiety and call reluctance?
38; ;00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:05,440; ;Because the brain only has so much bandwidth.
39; ;00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:10,560; ;When we concentrate on the task itself, there’s less room for dysfunctional thoughts.
40; ;00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:17,860; ;Instead of anxiety crowding out our ability to perform the task, the task itself crowds out the anxiety.
41; ;00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:26,480; ;The most critical time to stay task focused is during the first few steps of the call – picking up the phone, dialing the number and starting the conversation.
42; ;00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:31,600; ;That’s when you know the least about your prospects and are most worried about their reaction.
44; ;00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:40,880; ;Once the conversation gets rolling and you’re engaged, the anxiety usually dissipates.
43; ;00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:35,060; ;So that’s when you need to crowd out dysfunctional thinking.
45; ;00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:46,220; ;Here are some ways to make a task-focused approach more successful, based on the research:
46; ;00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:51,960; ;Don’t think ahead. When it’s time to dial the phone, don’t think about your opening statement.
47; ;00:04:51,960 --> 00:05:01,040; ;Just focus on dialing. When the prospect answers, don’t think about how you’ll counter objections; just deliver your opening statement.
48; ;00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:04,720; ;Approach objections as problems, not judgments.
49; ;00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:12,060; ;For example, if the prospect says, “We have someone who does that already,” it’s not a judgment of you or what you sell.
50; ;00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:14,440; ;Define it as a problem to be solved.
51; ;00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:26,120; ;If the “problem” is, “How do I keep this conversation going?” the “solution” might be to ask: “Do you think it might be worthwhile to find out what other options are available to you in case your needs change?”
52; ;00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:32,600; ;And if the call is unsuccessful, interpret it as a problem you couldn’t solve, not as personal rejection.
53; ;00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:37,740; ;Don’t ruminate over what you did wrong; simply move on to the next task.
54; ;00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:42,500; ;Of course, a task-focused approach doesn’t mean you’ll reach your goal for every call.
55; ;00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:47,860; ;But if you’re experiencing call reluctance, it can help you make more calls, and better ones.
56; ;00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:51,740; ;Your anxiety will diminish. You’ll procrastinate less.
57; ;00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:59,060; ;Your calls will begin with more confidence and will more likely result in a productive, meaningful conversation.

2; ;00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:06,960; ;Today's topic: GAPS: How to Gain When There's No Pain.
3; ;00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:12,340; ;Our subject matter expert is Steve Von Hoene, President of Journey Learning LLC.
4; ;00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:17,160; ;Like doctors, salespeople are trained to find pain and make it go away.
5; ;00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:22,100; ;But what if the prospect isn't in pain and feels no urgency to change?
6; ;00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:29,920; ;For example, Gwen makes a warm call to a prospect named Ron, who tells her, “I only agreed to this meeting because a friend referred you.
7; ;00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:34,320; ;I'm satisfied with my current vendor. You've got five minutes.”
8; ;00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,460; ;Imagine that 15 minutes later, Ron is still listening.
9; ;00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:45,580; ;Thirty minutes later Gwen has booked a next-steps appointment and feels confident she can win Ron's business.
10; ;00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:47,700; ;How did she do that?
11; ;00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:54,350; ;In this Quick take, you will learn: Why trying to find a prospect's PAIN could mean a PROBLEM for you.
12; ;00:00:54,350 --> 00:01:00,240; ;An alternative to find-the-pain selling that gives you a way to connect with more prospects, and…
13; ;00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:05,740; ;GAPS… A conversational road map that can lead to unexpected opportunities.
14; ;00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:11,280; ;There's nothing wrong with focusing on pain when prospects are feeling a strong urgency to change.
15; ;00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:21,260; ;But if the buyer seems satisfied with the status quo, sending him the message, “You're in pain but just don't know it,” turns YOU into a source of pain.
16; ;00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:28,480; ;The buyer is thinking, “This salesperson is trying to CREATE dissatisfaction just so she can sell me something.”
17; ;00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:31,260; ;So how did Gwen advance her sale with Ron?
18; ;00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:36,520; ;Instead of probing for Ron's pain, she found his “preferred situation.”
19; ;00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:45,025; ;All buyers have a Preferred Situation - even when their initial point of focus is something as mundane as, say, buying office paper.
20; ;00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:49,860; ;They may not have thought much about their preferred situation, or even know what it is.
21; ;00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:56,900; ;But even with “satisfied” prospects, there's almost always a gap between where they are now and where they could be.
22; ;00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:59,425; ;And that's the opening you're looking for.
23; ;00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:04,180; ;Some buyers will have a clear picture of where they'd like to be. But others won't.
24; ;00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:13,300; ;They need your help and expertise to guide them -- which means asking questions to help you genuinely understand them and what they're trying to accomplish.
25; ;00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:24,540; ;That's what Gwen did for Ron - and why her five-minute appointment turned into a 30-minute conversation that got him thinking in new ways about who supplies his office paper.
26; ;00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:30,100; ;Gwen used a discovery process called GAPS - G. A. P. S.
27; ;00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:32,300; ;G is general information.
28; ;00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:38,920; ;You begin with a broad discussion showing what you know about the business and getting the prospect to share more.
29; ;00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:44,600; ;Next, you move to A - the Actual situation the buyer is in at that moment.
30; ;00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:54,880; ;And finally, you find the gap between the actual situation and the Preferred Situation - that's the PS in GAPS -- that the prospect would like to reach.
31; ;00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:57,660; ;Here's how Gwen handles this GAPS call.
32; ;00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:03,560; ;She starts by sharing what she's learned on LinkedIn and the company Website about Ron's business.
33; ;00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:07,740; ;She's built rapport and shown Ron she's earnest and knowledgeable.
34; ;00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:22,320; ;And she's earned the right to start asking “G” questions, seeking information from Ron about, for example, growth plans, recent changes in company operations and organizational structure, how purchasing decisions are made, and so on.
35; ;00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:28,060; ;Next, Gwen moves on to A - Ron's Actual, or current, situation.
36; ;00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:30,580; ;“Help me get the lay of the land,” she says.
37; ;00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:35,440; ;“What are the key issues - good or bad - that you're focusing on right now?”
38; ;00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:41,120; ;Ron cites several items - none of which seem to have an obvious connection with printer paper.
39; ;00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:50,980; ;He mentions delivery challenges, efforts to fill key vacant positions, a disappointing ad campaign and the company's new sustainability initiative.
40; ;00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:57,250; ;Now, at this point a pain-oriented sales approach might try to find a problem to solve.
41; ;00:03:57,250 --> 00:04:01,080; ;But Gwen's not necessarily looking for problems.
42; ;00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:06,480; ;She's looking for an opportunity to get Ron closer to a Preferred Situation.
43; ;00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:14,240; ;Of the various issues that Ron mentioned, the sustainability issue seems like one that might be most relevant to what she sells.
44; ;00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:16,400; ;So she digs deeper.
45; ;00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:24,975; ;She asks Ron who's pushing the sustainability issue and he says, “Employees. They want to work for an environmentally responsible company.”
46; ;00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:33,100; ;Gwen now realizes she's teased out a Preferred Situation, and that it's anchored in value that she can deliver.
47; ;00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:38,260; ;She explains that she's helped many companies cut paper consumption by 20%.
48; ;00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:55,360; ;She commits to a free usage analysis, promises a plan to consume less paper, and offers to show Ron how other companies have created messaging around sustainability that positively affects multiple stakeholders, including employees, job candidates, prospects and customers.
49; ;00:04:55,360 --> 00:05:03,200; ;NOW Gwen's really got Ron's attention. She's reframed her value proposition so that she's no longer “just selling paper.”
50; ;00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:09,775; ;And she's done it not by finding pain but by helping Ron get to a  Preferred Situation.
51; ;00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:14,625; ;GAPS is a more sophisticated consultative selling strategy than “finding pain.”
52; ;00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:20,525; ;It requires more skill, and more practice, and frankly doesn't always yield immediate results.
53; ;00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:24,500; ;In our example, Gwen made huge progress in a single call.
54; ;00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:38,560; ;You may find that it takes several meetings to help a prospect to move from “I'm satisfied with the status quo” to “the status quo is holding me back and I'm feeling urgency to pursue a solution I'd never even considered.”
55; ;00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:47,650; ;At least not until someone with your experience, and your ability to ask the right questions, revealed a better situation in the buyer's future.

1; ;00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:03,050; ;Welcome to this Quick Take rapid learning module.
2; ;00:00:03,050 --> 00:00:07,525; ;Today’s topic: Why salespeople just can’t shut up.
3; ;00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:12,550; ;As salespeople, we know we make more money when we talk less and listen more.
4; ;00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:17,725; ;We know the dangers of droning on about ourselves, our products and our companies.
5; ;00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:21,560; ;And yet salespeople still talk too much.
6; ;00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:29,025; ;According to one study, the average salesperson talks over 81 percent of the time in a selling situation.
7; ;00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:35,150; ;So why do we keep dominating conversations with customers, even when we know we shouldn’t?
8; ;00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:45,400; ;In this Quick Take, you will learn: What scientific research can tell us about why salespeople talk too much – about themselves, their companies, and their products.
9; ;00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:49,025; ;Why we talk about ourselves more than we think we do.
10; ;00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:55,600; ;Three simple techniques you can use to overcome the brain’s natural inclination to keep talking, and
11; ;00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:01,925; ;Five nonverbal cues that will tell you when it’s time to turn the conversation over to the buyer.
12; ;00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:07,500; ;Let’s look at a series of studies conducted by neuroscientists from Harvard University.
13; ;00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:11,475; ;In the first set of studies, the researchers set up a simple choice.
14; ;00:01:11,470 --> 00:01:23,350; ;They offered volunteers money for answering questions about well-known people -- for example, to speculate about whether these people were intelligent, enjoyed snowboarding or liked mushrooms on their pizza.
15; ;00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:29,950; ;Or the volunteers could choose to answer similar questions about themselves -- and get paid nothing.
16; ;00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:34,625; ;It turned out that people couldn’t resist the opportunity to talk about themselves.
17; ;00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:43,650; ;The study found that people would give up between 17 and 25% of their potential earnings to talk about themselves rather than others!
18; ;00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:47,260; ;That’s exactly what happens in sales every day.
19; ;00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:55,325; ;Salespeople forgo earnings – in the form of commissions and bonuses – for the privilege of talking about themselves.
20; ;00:01:55,320 --> 00:02:01,380; ;In a second series of studies, the researchers wanted to discover why this urge is so powerful.
21; ;00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:08,250; ;So they used MRI tests to track brain responses while subjects talked about themselves.
22; ;00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:19,625; ;They found that such talk triggered the “meso-limbic dopamine system” -- the same part of the brain associated with feelings of reward and satisfaction from food, sex or money.
23; ;00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:25,600; ;The reason we can’t stop talking about ourselves is because it feels so good.
24; ;00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:32,350; ;The research also found that self-talk is self-perpetuating: The more you do it, the more you want to do it.
25; ;00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:43,000; ;Which is understandable because the brain's meso-limbic dopamine system, the part activated by self-talk, is involved in compulsive and binging behaviors.
26; ;00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:51,000; ;These studies also shed light not only on why we talk about ourselves but also why we do it more than we think we do.
27; ;00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,950; ;As with other types of compulsions, self-talk often occurs automatically.
28; ;00:02:55,950 --> 00:03:02,450; ;We engage in it almost without thinking, but afterwards the brain works hard to rationalize the behavior.
29; ;00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:13,250; ;We convince ourselves that the information we’re dumping on buyers is valuable, or that the buyer is hungry to learn more, or that we weren’t really talking that much anyway.
30; ;00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:19,000; ;So how can we overcome this powerful psychological urge to talk about ourselves?
31; ;00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,425; ;Being aware of why it’s happening is a start.
32; ;00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:35,350; ;But because the behavior is driven by automatic and often-unconscious processes, it’s also useful to cultivate habits of speech that force ourselves to stop and pay attention to what we’re saying.
33; ;00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:40,380; ;Here are three to consider: One: The 30- to 60-second rule.
34; ;00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:45,760; ;Talk freely about 30 seconds, then look for a place to stop before you get to 60.
35; ;00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:50,580; ;You can practice this technique with a colleague, using a watch and trading roles.
36; ;00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:57,200; ;You may be surprised by how short a minute seems when you’re talking, and how long it seems when you’re listening.
37; ;00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:00,075; ;Two: Single-sentence responses.
38; ;00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:05,075; ;A customer’s question often becomes an excuse to launch into a long monologue.
39; ;00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:12,925; ;Instead, answer questions with one sentence, then stop and ask for the customer’s feedback before you continue.
40; ;00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:18,000; ;If your customer wants a more elaborate answer, he or she will say so.
41; ;00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,350; ;Three: Speak, stop and ask.
42; ;00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:26,400; ;This technique breaks the flow and invites customers to engage.
43; ;00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:30,300; ;For example, you’ve just explained a key feature of your offering.
44; ;00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:36,425; ;Instead of elaborating, stop and ask the customer, “How might that be helpful to you?”
45; ;00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:44,175; ;Before we conclude, let’s look at some customer cues that can give you a heads up before the buyer has decided to check out.
46; ;00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:51,925; ;Research has found that the body displays loss of attention up to nine seconds before the conscious mind is aware of it.
47; ;00:04:51,920 --> 00:05:00,325; ;These physical cues can act as an early warning system, allowing you to shift the conversation before you lose the other person:
48; ;00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:06,075; ;Cue number 1: They angle their body away from you, creating physical distance.
49; ;00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:14,250; ;Number 2: They turn their feet toward the door of the room -- unconsciously displaying a literal desire to escape.
50; ;00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:21,475; ;Three: They display physical signs of agitation: they tap their fingers, doodle or play with a smart phone.
51; ;00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:25,975; ;Four: They smile too widely and/or for too long.
52; ;00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:30,900; ;Here the facial expression becomes a substitute for, not a sign of, attention.
53; ;00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:37,000; ;And five: Their eye contact becomes fixed and their head becomes very still.
54; ;00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:43,775; ;When you’re on the phone, of course, you can’t see these visual cues, so it’s much harder to tell when a buyer’s attention is drifting.
55; ;00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:55,200; ;But if the buyer is responding with monosyllables, or isn’t responding at all, or tries to interrupt, stop talking and ask your customer or prospect to tell you what’s on their mind.
56; ;00:05:55,200 --> 00:06:03,675; ;Let’s review what we’ve learned in this Quick Take: Buyers see yackers as less likable, less credible and less worthy of their business.
57; ;00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:10,160; ;But brain research shows that it's really hard not to talk about yourself because it makes you feel so good.
58; ;00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:19,775; ;Use these techniques to keep the conversation focused on your buyer: The 30 to 60 second rule: speak for 30 seconds then look for a place to pause.
59; ;00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:27,025; ;Single sentence responses: When a buyer asks a question, respond with brief answers not a monologue.
60; ;00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:33,350; ;Speak, stop and ask: Make a statement then ask the buyer a question.

1; ;00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,900; ;Welcome to this Quick Take rapid learning module.
2; ;00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:08,700; ;Today’s topic: The value of small promises: Earning the "fairness premium."
3; ;00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:13,700; ;Abigail believes that if you want to win big, you have to make bold moves.
4; ;00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:19,875; ;So when her customer mentions that the big boss is coming to town next month, Abigail sees an opportunity.
5; ;00:00:19,870 --> 00:00:25,325; ;She promises to accelerate a key project so the customer will have results to show the boss.
6; ;00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:28,950; ;Then Abigail moves heaven and earth to meet the new deadline.
7; ;00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:33,175; ;In fact, she gets it to the customer two days early.
8; ;00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:35,225; ;The customer is blown away.
9; ;00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:37,800; ;But it took Abigail a lot of work.
10; ;00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:41,675; ;And it was risky: What if she hadn’t been able to deliver?
11; ;00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:46,650; ;And most important, Abigail wonders what she actually gained for her efforts.
12; ;00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:53,150; ;In the past, she’s overdelivered on promises to customers, only to find that the goodwill didn’t last long.
13; ;00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:59,950; ;When the next project came along, they bid it out and bought on price – just like always.
14; ;00:00:59,950 --> 00:01:07,525; ;So now Abigail is wondering: Is there an easier – and less risky – way to win a customer’s gratitude and trust?
15; ;00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:13,825; ;In this Quick Take, you will learn: What people feel when someone makes a promise to them and keeps it.
16; ;00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:25,675; ;How the concept of the “fairness premium” can help you improve your relationship with the buyer, and why the best strategy is to make lots of small promises that are easy to keep.
17; ;00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:30,500; ;Everyone understands the value of a promise made, and a promise kept.
18; ;00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:44,900; ;But research suggests that it’s not the size of promises but their frequency that matters most, and that making and keeping many small promises can do more to build your relationship than the occasional grand gesture.
19; ;00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:55,450; ;To see why, let’s take a closer look at the science of promises, with a study from the University of Chicago’s business school and the UC-San Diego school of management.
20; ;00:01:55,450 --> 00:02:01,800; ;Researchers asked people to imagine a scenario in which a friend promised to help them with an important task.
21; ;00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:05,400; ;Then, the researchers presented three different outcomes:
22; ;00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:11,800; ;One group of subjects was told that the friend dropped the ball, providing much less help than expected.
23; ;00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:15,600; ;The second group was told that the friend had done what he’d promised.
24; ;00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:21,050; ;The third group was told that the friend over-delivered – providing more help than expected.
25; ;00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:31,800; ;Next, the people in the experiment were asked how they felt about their hypothetical friend – to rate him as selfish, fair or generous, and to indicate how grateful they felt toward him.
26; ;00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:40,350; ;No surprise, the researchers found that evaluations were significantly more positive toward those who kept their promises than those who broke them.
27; ;00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:49,325; ;What is surprising is that overdelivering – giving people more than they expected -- brought no additional benefit to the promise maker.
28; ;00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:54,550; ;That last finding tells us something very important about the nature of promises.
29; ;00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:58,100; ;It’s making and keeping a promise that matters most.
30; ;00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:04,575; ;The researchers concluded that a kept promise earns something psychologists call a “fairness premium”:
31; ;00:03:04,570 --> 00:03:16,625; ;In order to be fair, the person receiving the promise feels obliged to acknowledge not only that the promise makers provided valuable help, but also that they are good, reliable human beings.
32; ;00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:20,425; ;Let’s stop and think about the power of that last idea.
33; ;00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:25,500; ;It suggests that when you keep a promise, you get a double dividend.
34; ;00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:28,150; ;You get credit for the value delivered.
35; ;00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:32,900; ;But you also get a personal premium for being trustworthy.
36; ;00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:39,475; ;Making and keeping multiple promises – even small ones – earns you the premium over and over.
37; ;00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:47,150; ;The customer learns that you are a person who always delivers what you promise, and never promises what you can’t deliver.
38; ;00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:50,300; ;So let’s go back to our example with Abigail.
39; ;00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:54,950; ;She saw one big opportunity to wow her buyer, and was right to take it.
40; ;00:03:54,950 --> 00:04:01,750; ;But the research says she probably didn’t get an extra "fairness premium" by overdelivering on her promise.
41; ;00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:14,600; ;To build a strong, durable long-term relationship with that buyer, she’d be wise to make and keep many smaller, lower-risk promises that establish her as a trusted, reliable person.
42; ;00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:19,900; ;So let’s review the practical implications of these findings for salespeople:
43; ;00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:23,975; ;One: Leverage the value of many little promises.
44; ;00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:29,800; ;Look for opportunities throughout the sales process to make small, easily keep-able promises.
45; ;00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:36,050; ;Remember, the fairness premium comes from keeping the promise – not the size of the promise.
46; ;00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:39,100; ;Two: Make the promises explicit.
47; ;00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:42,800; ;You’re probably making and keeping promises to buyers all the time.
48; ;00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:48,950; ;But if the buyer doesn’t perceive them as promises, you don’t earn the "fairness premium."
49; ;00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:58,475; ;There’s a huge difference, for example, between saying “Your order will arrive on Tuesday” and “I promise you that your order will arrive on Tuesday.”
50; ;00:04:58,470 --> 00:05:06,425; ;You don’t have to say “I promise” every time, but be clear that you are actively committing to making something happen.
51; ;00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:09,250; ;Three: Make promises personal.
52; ;00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:13,300; ;The fairness premium is about you, not your company or product.
53; ;00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:17,425; ;So don’t say, “We promise.” Say, “I promise.”
54; ;00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:20,325; ;And four: You don’t have to make a promise.
55; ;00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:23,525; ;But if you do, keep it no matter what.
56; ;00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:27,475; ;You pay a big price for every failed promise.
57; ;00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:28,520; ;Thanks for watching.

1; ;00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:02,840; ;Welcome to this Quick Take rapid learning module.
2; ;00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:08,160; ;Today’s topic: Communication: How prospects first decide whether to trust you.
3; ;00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:13,740; ;In this Quick Take, we’re going explore how prospects first decide whether to trust you.
4; ;00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:16,200; ;Let’s start with a basic question:
5; ;00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:17,940; ;What is trust?
6; ;00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:25,520; ;In long-term relationships with buyers, it means they believe they can count on us to do what we say and to treat them fairly.
7; ;00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:31,480; ;Over time, we have the chance to say and do things that build and sustain trust with our customers.
8; ;00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:34,380; ;But what about buyers we’ve never worked with before?
9; ;00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:39,260; ;What causes buyers to trust, or distrust, you in your initial meetings?
10; ;00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:41,440; ;In this Quick Take, you will learn:
11; ;00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:45,340; ;The two factors that determine trust early in relationships.
12; ;00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:53,040; ;How quickly buyers make decisions about trustworthiness, based on verbal cues that salespeople often trigger unconsciously.
13; ;00:00:53,040 --> 00:01:00,860; ;And the four categories of verbal cues  – and how deploying them successfully will make people perceive you as more trustworthy.
14; ;00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:12,620; ;Numerous scientific studies have found that in the very early stages of any relationship – including a buyer-seller relationship – the decision to trust someone comes down to two questions:
15; ;00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:17,880; ;First: Is this person on my side – that is, are they willing to help me?
16; ;00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:22,100; ;And second, are they competent – are they able to help me?
17; ;00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:33,300; ;A study from Southern Methodist University found that people make up their minds about these two factors within minutes, and that the judgments are remarkably consistent from one person to the next.
18; ;00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:44,760; ;The researchers found that certain verbal cues – cues that you can incorporate into your initial sales conversations -- will increase prospects’ trust and willingness to engage with you.
19; ;00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:57,980; ;In the SMU experiment, researchers videotaped college students who’d been asked to speak off the cuff about various mundane topics – their classes, their experiences at college, what was going on in their lives at that moment.
20; ;00:01:57,980 --> 00:02:11,460; ;Then the researchers showed snippets of these videos – each snippet lasting about a minute and a half -- to a second group of students and asked them to evaluate each speaker on a variety of measures, including trustworthiness.
21; ;00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:21,580; ;The researchers analyzed the language used in the interviews, evaluating such things as how often people used negative words and positive words and how often they referred to themselves.
22; ;00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:26,140; ;Then the researchers looked at how the language related to trustworthiness.
23; ;00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:30,940; ;They found four verbal cues that were associated with high perceived trust:
24; ;00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:37,120; ;Using fewer “negative emotion” words – words such as “angry,” “sad” and “wrong”
25; ;00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:44,340; ;Speaking  in the present tense – that is, statements focused on the here-and-now rather than what’s happened in the past.
26; ;00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:51,140; ;Using fewer “I,” “me” and “our” statements, and speaking simply and directly.
27; ;00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:54,340; ;Nothing on this list will surprise sales reps.
28; ;00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:59,100; ;We’ve all been taught to be positive, present, customer-focused and clear.
29; ;00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:07,800; ;What may be less obvious is how deeply these four factors in particular relate to perceptions of trust when you first meet a prospect.
30; ;00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:15,120; ;They often operate on an unconscious level, sending the message to buyers that you’re willing and able to help them.
31; ;00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:20,520; ;Of the four, the one with the greatest impact on trust is speaking simply and directly.
32; ;00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:25,480; ;Researchers measured it by counting the number of “unique words” in each video snippet.
33; ;00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:30,440; ;People who speak simply used a limited vocabulary of everyday words over and over.
34; ;00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:41,120; ;Those who fill their speech with jargon, fillers and qualifiers end up with a higher unique word count, and are perceived as anxious, uncertain or dishonest.
35; ;00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:45,040; ;For example, how much would you trust someone who said this?
36; ;00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:48,600; ;“We would all have to say that mistakes were made in terms of comments.
37; ;00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:55,840; ;I was overenthusiastic in my comments … particularly if you look at them in the context of developments that have taken place.”
38; ;00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:04,660; ;That statement, which of course sounds evasive and dishonest, came from Nixon’s press secretary in 1973, during Watergate.
39; ;00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:07,920; ;You’d trigger the same reaction if you told a prospect,
40; ;00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:18,680; ;“All things being equal, and assuming conditions remain largely in line with current expectations, you can expect to see a reasonable increase in revenues, beginning over the course of 60 to 90 days.”
41; ;00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:25,460; ;Buyers trust straight talk, as in, “You can expect revenues to go up 6% in a couple of months.”
42; ;00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:31,580; ;Now let’s turn to the other three cues that influence trust, starting with negative emotions.
43; ;00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:41,140; ;The research found that words such as “angry,” “sad” and “wrong” undermine perceived trustworthiness, even when the speakers were talking about mundane topics.
44; ;00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:43,280; ;There’s no real surprise there.
45; ;00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:50,460; ;But it’s easy for negative language to creep into conversations with prospects, even when we’re trying to be positive and helpful.
46; ;00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:55,240; ;We might ask, for example, “What would you say is your biggest challenge right now?”
47; ;00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:58,120; ;Or even worse, “What keeps you up at night?”
48; ;00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:03,900; ;Later in a relationship, after you’ve built up a reservoir of trust, you can ask questions like that.
49; ;00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:10,660; ;But in initial encounters, eliciting negative emotions undermines prospects’ confidence in you.
50; ;00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:19,940; ;This finding is consistent with other studies showing that focusing too much on buyers’ fears can increase their anxiety and make them less likely to buy.
51; ;00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:22,640; ;Of course you must discover the buyer’s needs.
52; ;00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:26,100; ;But you can use positive instead of negative language.
53; ;00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:28,880; ;Instead of challenges, ask about opportunities:
54; ;00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,960; ;“If you could do one thing better, what would it be?”
55; ;00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:38,000; ;Instead of asking about the buyer’s “pain,” ask: “What would the ideal outcome look like for you?”
56; ;00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,280; ;Instead of asking what keeps them up at night, find out what would make them sleep better.
57; ;00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:49,640; ;The last two factors -- present tense and fewer I statements – seem to be about mindfulness and focus.
58; ;00:05:49,640 --> 00:06:03,520; ;Citing your track record with other customers, or your own credentials, takes the spotlight off the buyer’s biggest concern – whether you can help him or her right now -- and puts it on what you did for someone else at another time.
59; ;00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:14,500; ;You may think you’re showing your willingness and ability to help the prospect, but the “I” language, and references to past successes, causes the buyer to disconnect and erodes trust.
60; ;00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:16,820; ;Let’s review what we’ve learned today:
61; ;00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:23,920; ;Prospects will make a gut decision – often within the first minute or two -- about whether they trust you enough to continue to engage.
62; ;00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:27,000; ;They’re judging you on two key questions:
63; ;00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,400; ;“Are you willing to help me?” And “are you able to help me?”
64; ;00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:35,980; ;How you structure that first conversation will have a big impact on those answers.
65; ;00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:42,180; ;Research has found four verbal cues that you can use to increase your perceived trustworthiness:
66; ;00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:43,980; ;Avoid negative language.
67; ;00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:47,580; ;Speak in the present tense—focus on the here and now.
68; ;00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:49,220; ;Don’t talk about yourself.
69; ;00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:51,140; ;Keep the focus on your prospect.
70; ;00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:57,060; ;And most important, be direct—use simple language and don’t beat around the bush.
71; ;00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:58,080; ;Thanks for watching.

1; ;00:00:05,710 --> 00:05:00,360; ;So, we are recording. Yeah. If you could just [unintelligible] Yeah, so, what you find is that in [unintelligible] network, they're managing to rule independent FMC's served. We've got.. .[unintelligible] one on Firesite at 5.4. Um... but that's going to be upgraded to 6.2. That's going to be retired pretty soon, right? Yeah, and then we'll be moving to our new 6.2 installation that's out there. Yeah, so what still is the idea is that the intersect still has the big heavy IDS only environment? And then we have networks which has the FMC 6.2 also. And they just started adding some of the threat prevention stuff in their environment. But, today they manage their systems independently. And I'm sure that you guys probably going to eventually have some work flow within networks FMC. At least as far as managing IPS internet policy. But they are separate today. So which system does what or which team does what, since you are using two separate systems. So the impulse tech team will handle all the IES. And the source fire clients is basically in their own FMC completely separate from ours. And then we have, we have several FMC instances. But we manage all the FTEs. So, it's interesting for us because the FTE is a new technology that's right for both teams. And since we've deployed it, we kind of have owned the IDS policy, the end policy, and the access control policy within our FTEs. So, at some point we're going to match the teams, I'd imagine. But we don't know how, when, the need hasn't come up yet. So, I imagine it will at some point too, but right now we're just kind of two separate entities. We're trying to partner better between teams. It just interesting how it's worked historically, so it's hard to change how we've always done things. And kind of have a new partnership mindset. And so, I heard that you guys also have a lot of ESPs. Are those separately manage, is there a separate team or? No, our team manages the ASAs. We've got about 2200, 2300 ASAs deployed. We have a CSM for managing that. So, a lot of our firewall experience is going to be related to CSM. And a lot of the features that we want to see definitely come from CSM. So, I don't want to continue to compare the two products. But, I don't know if you've got experience with CSM or if you've ever seen the tool. Nothing compares to CSM. There are kind of bugs in it and there's issues with it but, the tool is great. The amount of things you could do in there, single pane of glass, couple modules, event viewer and image management, stuff like that. But, it was just a perfect tool for calls. You guys just kind of stopped development on it so, we have to move to FMC. So, we wanna see some of the features from CSM make it to FMC. We want the experience to be as good as it was on CSM, if not better. And you, does your team think that the CSM will work as well? Yes. So... As in FTE? Yup, CSM, FT, FMC. The way the process works when requested. So security is involved in firewall request. They have to approve the request. But then our team takes them, holds them, and deploys them and owns it beyond just approving the access. So could you start a little at the beginning? Where are these request coming from and then what sort of work flow you use in the beginning? Yes. How does reporting go back and forth between you? Sure, it is a process that we're slowly looking to change. It's constantly evolving, we're trying to make it easier for the App teams. But right now, the expectation is for the App teams to understand their application and submit the access that they need. This slows things down. So, we've been asked to come up with a better way. More of a concierge service for them where we help them understand their application and we submit their request on their behalf. That hasn't happened yet. We don't wanna go that route but we're kind of being forced into that route. But right now, the App teams own their requests. And they bait click a lot on an excel spreadsheet that they downloaded on our ticketing system called service mount. They re-upload the spreadsheet, they submit the spreadsheet, Their manager has to approve the access they're requesting. Network has to approve the access, security has to approve the access, and then it gets assigned to somebody to actually code the change. So, by access, I'm understanding that the updates we need, or something to be opened up so our application can work, either repeat or [unintelligible] other system. Exactly.
2; ;00:05:00,360 --> 00:10:03,130; ;Internal as well? Yes, definitely. And then, so, they allow an excel spreadsheet, they go through the process being submitted, and then how do the approvals work? Does everyone get, does all the team, do all the teams get a notification? One at a time. What, so they are like a chain-link? Yes, the first one is the manager of the person just so there's kind of a team ownership and responsibility of the access, and it's not just random people submitting requests. The manager kind of takes responsibility on behalf of their engineer submitting. And then network team approves it to make sure to make sure the access is valid and it doesn't break any obvious policies that [unintelligible] set. So, some of the insecure ports, some of zone to zone communication that we would prefer not to allow or stuff that just doesn't make sense. So, we're kind of like the first point before it make the [unintelligible]. All right, the second part and then it goes to [unintelligible]. They go through their policies of what they allow and what they don't allow to make sure that the request is good. And then it goes to the engineer to actually code it. Okay so, once network and [unintelligible] approve, it's off to being paired? Yup, and we generally rely on our L2 team to code the access, unless it's project work. Then we usually have an L3 resource assigned to the project that would own the request or give them L2 to code. So it kind of goes both ways. We have a team L2 people and we're trying to give them full access to the deployments. One of the issues we're having in FMC is there's no work flow like there is in CSM. So, when somebody makes the change the L2 guy can't see the change that they actually made. I can see if they modified an access control policy. I can't see the actual rules that they deployed or what they change in the tool. Do they deploy or do they just make the change and then give one of you guys to log in and then... So, the FMC instances that we've deployed, we haven't really... They're technically production but they're not following our production model of specific deployment windows. The deployment windows we have were the result of issues that CSM caught. So, within FMC, we've never had an issues on deployments causing an issue. So, we're trying to be a little bit more relaxed in that environment. And the environments we have FTD in, they're our equinox products change and they're very dynamic. Right now, we have GCP Google out there and they're just all day long filling our firewall request. So, we have to kind of be able to respond to that and get the access in right away. So, we have dedicated project teams working on that and just deploying access as it goes. Our ASA environment is managed by CSM because CSM's caused issues in the past and upper management doesn't trust it that much. We have specific deployment windows for that. And so when you say your L3 team actually takes care of making changes based on, you know, everyone's approval of it. So, does this team touch all these devices so, like if any of it changes it's the same team as the FTE is the same team or... So the ASA changes most definitely the L2 team will handle. Right now, the cross training hasn't been there as mush as it should have been for the FTE environment. So that, then generally just the L3 resources doing the FT changes. But they are all of the same team, it's the same team that deploys any and all changes? Yes, eventually. All the network, security or whatever so, they specialize across... That would be the angle. That's a big problem for us because it ends up being about 24 people that need access to FMC or CSM. CSM from a resource perspective can't really handle 24 people logged in. So, we've got a lot of scenarios where we have jump boxes, and we ensure that there's only a few people logged in at once to cut resources. Actually... FMC, we haven't been able to really stress-test it with a lot of users using the system at once. And right now, because there's no work flow and no way to see what change was deployed, we're kind of hesitant to give L2 access. Because there's been scenarios where they've deployed any internet edge on all interfaces. And the only reason we caught that is because we have work flow in place, where L3 has to go in and peer-review their change and actually approve their change before it gets deployed. So, we've caught that now. L2 any change they do requires peer-review. They don't peer-review themselves, L3 peer-reviews them. And the classic example of that issue is when we discuss [unintelligible], right? There was a bug that they, someone called it [unintelligible] about access control policy. Yup. Yeah, so we... The only way to get that because they knew of that bug... They have two people on their team. We've got 25 people on our team. And there is absolutely no way I'd be able to track down who did what in FMC. So we've stepped through some of that stuff. Derek shared our list of feature enhancements or issues with the tool we have.
3; ;00:10:03,930 --> 00:15:00,300; ;But I think if you guys need any clarification on that or want to see some of that stuff live, I think that's probably a good place to start. The list goes on and on every day when we use the tool. The more and more we use the tool, the bigger the list gets. So, we going to cover that list in the afternoon when we have Craig, who's our lead engineer also coming so that him and Hill can sit down with you and you know back with one pieces. So I'd like to spend some time before that to understand overall how you guys work. Because a lot of the changes that we bring to the table are not necessarily on your list per se. But, just like for the start in general is going to based off of what we learned from you in terms of how we do hand-offs, like Patti mentioned, auditing the requests and such. So, is it okay to continue on this line? Yeah, that's perfect. Yeah, so we can do that now. I prefer Craig to be here for the list. He's in a better position to comment on some of that, you know. And um... I think on our side, we're turning in a PCI compliance. So, anything to help us from our perspective of physical devices and the access control policies in the tool would be beneficial. Right now, there isn't a lot. The recording thats there, we feel is not sufficient for anything, really. We can dump the ACC policy but your 50 rules end up being 150 pages of PDF. So there's a lot of issues around auditing where, we kind of haven't really thought of putting any auditing stuff in there. There's no way that it comes withing the ACC policy. You can't right click on a rule and say, "show me the events for this rule." You have to put in a very complex filter to match that rule, to find the events that match that rule. Is there a contact with the FMC for this? Yes. Okay. So, at the very beginning you have an FMC that your team manages and there's an FMC that [unintelligible] team manages. How can some of these requests come in if the other FMC has to be worked on? Is it still the same FMC team or do you have to pass it on? So we record up to two complete separate VPs. So ours came at two complete separate dialogs. They would have their own L2 team, I think you guys are working on that, work in progress. Okay. We have more of an established L2 team completely separate. But like we said earlier, the source fires and the FMCs that the [unintelligible] team manages are just IES. That's it. No FTEs, no firewall, nothing. Our side... So it's just monitoring, that's all? We weren't entirely out of band on ours. We are not in line with these particular event that could go on feed. They simply tap in, duplicate the traffic and feed it over to our IES. So maybe we can talk a little bit about that switch gears a little bit. So, you guys martyr for those. Based on what you find you feed it back in to... We take action in one of the other tools somewhere in the network. Yeah we gotta send that, send feeds to. And we work the alerts from there, if we find something of interest that requires deeper dive. Then we go back into source fire and do our deeper dive thre, look at the[unintelligible]. It was yours that brought the IES? Only IES, yes. Okay. And then when you find something that you want to do something about, let's say you want to change your security password, you then open a ticket and have their team actually do the blocking or... No, he just manages the back-end, we actually manage the tool and all the rules and rules project in policy and whatnot. Yeah, so, we tune the tool and adjust it. But yeah, I mean if there's a firewall changes that needs to happen, we would open a ticket with the network. Yes. The reason that you find a security that you want to close, what do you do? Sorry, I'm not going to take it from your team today. That depend on what it is. If it's, you know, like a beginning after a malware site then we're going to contact the end user that possibly generate the, or triggered the [unintelligible] ID and put that in source fire and find out if they have some kind of malware on their system. We see um, you know, simple injection. We'll do the same thing there, you know, to verify whether it was actually compromising the end point. We'll, actually often times one of the first things we check is, is the end-point actually vulnerable to this. Because often times we find is that we'll get a Microsoft IIS smart rule that fires on one of our system. So wouldn't discovery in FMC help with that? So, yeah, we get a lot of those false alarm. When you do see something that is not a false positive, what do you do with that information?
4; ;00:15:00,300 --> 00:20:05,630; ;Don't think it's happen yet. Well, I've worked some malware, and spyware, and whatnot items triggered from source fire in the past. How many? But well, that's when we were feeding the entire [unintelligible]. Right now, we're only getting impact twos. So you stop feeding impact one? No, they just... One of our [unintelligible] engineers has been trying to work on tweaking the, that connection and get it to double up the impact ones as opposed to the impact twos. Because we really want to be looking at the impact one. The impact one, that's when it knows. Once our fire alerts start impacting two the impact one do nothing at this time. So I'm still a little bit unclear about how the two things work on security. You guys monitor your work but you have the other sim and such that you use to get a lot of... Yes, it's IDS firewalls. Two completely separate entities. How do you guys monitor it? So, that is a very interesting question. We don't. So we send all of our data to Cue Radar which is managed by the [unintelligible] team. They have a dedicated monitoring team. So we don't pro-actively monitor our logs whatsoever. This is a problem for us. This is something we need to address especially because most of our [unintelligible] feed are set to monitor only. Which means somebody is going out there pro-actively looking at these feeds and doing something with them but no one is. So out of the next gen features of the FMC and FTE, we're really not taking as much advantage of as we could. Because we don't have somebody looking at logs. We don't have somebody honing the data from this device. We see malware constantly getting triggered from our two [unintelligible] providers and coming out of our store. But we're not actually like... So it goes into the Cue Radar, the [unintelligible] takes a look. If it fires and [unintelligible]. Yeah, so in that case does it come back to your team for a fix or... If we require them to do a fix or fix something then yes. But often times it's the owner of the team that we engage not the network team. Because it will be an application or a host that's generating the traffic. So when we engage the owner or the host... We contact the unit team or... And we'll instruct them if you need to open this or you need to block this, whatever you need to open a ticket to the network team. So that's how you channel it. But it does end up at their door step where they then actually... If there's action on the firewall, yeah. If there's action on the firewall? Which in the time of our 10 years, we've had like five or six issues where we've actually blocked something on the firewall level. Okay. And it a lot of scenarios it's like Verizon's scanning us and are causing impact to our firewall or something like that. We're not at that direction anyway though. We've blocked quite a bit already anyway. I mean, looking at the perimeters. But that's beyond the point. I mean have an implicit denier on every firewall, so we're not allowing things through without knowing what it is. I think in lot of scenarios. You guys don't need to involve us to because you guys reach out [unintelligible] stop doing what ever they're doing. I install what ever they have or work with the server team to get the malware uninstalled. So it hasn't really been a network issue per se. Okay, since it is a sector deny and becoming traffic which is I was curious. So even with IDS most things won't even come trough, so is the chances of having to lock something.... I would say that most of the IDS alerts were all internal based. Okay. [Unintelligible] That's why I was asking. So that's why I was thinking you might be working with them more closely, but it looks like you work with the internal team to say your App is doing "X" or such... In a lot of cases, it's not making it out. You guys just see it in your logs getting triggered, but at some point through the network staff the proxies or firewalls it gets blocked. That's what I was trying to understand, I was a little confused. And that's when we engage the owner of that application or the host that generating this traffic. I tell him, "Hey, you need to fix whatever it is on your end to stop generating that traffic." We don't actually tell 'cause the networks already blocking it, in some case you know, black-holing it. We just, more or less creating logs for you guys and you guys look into our logs. Yeah, that is what I need to know to get a better sense of what you guys doing. We wanted to get through the networks so we can get down to the end-degree that actually requires our attention. And so, do you also work, do all of you work with tickets for anything? Like you as an App team, so if you see something that you need the App team need to work on, you guys have a work flow in place you use in your system or you just email them and say, "Hey..." We have a ticketing system. We, depending on what it is, if we're just requesting some information like, "Hey, we see something odd. Can you explain what this is?" Formality dictates the format. So if it's something we need definitive information on it's a ticket. It's a light-hearted reach out email... I see. So it looks like the App teams are the center of everything that happens.
5; ;00:20:05,630 --> 00:25:02,360; ;Because you work with them if there's something that they need to do. Or if they need something from your team, you guys come in? Or, let's say your teams won't necessarily work a lot together or is that not true? I think that's true. Do we see that changing, especially now that... You guys work with [unintelligible] and the monitoring team. Yeah so, I mean, I think we're comfortable now to walk to each other's teams and ask for help. Like more of an informal route, we don't really open up tickets in a lot of cases. Because it's more of informal communication following a ticket for something like that. We're trying to partner better. Like I said, we built a network security team, we're looking for a manager and you guys are welcome to apply. But we're not sure where that team's going to go. We just, we know that there needs to be more of an understanding of the network from the [unintelligible] perspective. And we need to understand their tools from the network side. There's a lot of security products that we're looking at. We have a security [unintelligible] that overlap a lot of products that they have. So understanding each other's technology that we have out there and the infrastructure we've layed out. And then basically, I don't know, I created this weekly meetings that are kind of cross-team meetings between network and security. And the goal of the meeting was to understand the entire security staff [unintelligible] the internet. The path of the meeting hasn't gone that route. But eventually both teams are going to have a very solid understanding of what they're protecting and what tools everyone has to consume for the protection. Because right now, which is kind of, I mean you guys have a physical wall separating you from everyone else. So it's kind of breaking down that wall and trying to partner better. Would you say your team owns the actual access all the way from host through to the outside? So anything that has to happen, like firewall, applications controlling the system, does your team manage? Yes, they would've. Their play in that would be approving the firewall request for the FS. We would own, actually making sure the access is valid, booting the access and deploying the access. Okay, so at a device level you guys have control and ownership but they would have to approve any changes you need to make? And in the security level changes come from them or are approved by them? You own the devices, you would actually implement the changes. Good, [unintelligible]. Providing access to a particular application [unintelligible]. You would do the change but you'll need to get approval from them? Correct. Yeah, we're just one of the steps in the whole process. So we have proxies on the way out we have WCCs redirecting to proxies. So if we have similar requests going out it would be approved by security, who will be recorded by our team on our reports. So if there's any sort of access needed would go through our team but they would be approving access as well. So pretty much every request requires someone on their team to approve? Any sort of access related request to them. At any level? Yup. And do you have like specialists that deal with CSM or FMC, or do you do pretty much everything? Me, Mohan, and Sire are the CSM, FMC specialist. So it's, we don't have a lot of network security engineers on our side, Mohan is our consultant. I'm really the only FT dedicated to the network security side. I think in the past it just been something that is confusing to people and people are kind of scared of it. So we don't have a lot of people on our team wanting to take ownership. So we spun up this new teams on network security and people are getting dumped into it. We've taken the F5 technology, low-balancing technology, DNS, IIS, firewalls, VPNs and we've lumped them all into this team. Because they're all security type technologies. So whoever isn't us three has been trying to start learning all of this security technologies we have out there. So you said you're using IIS as well. How does that relate to the rest of [unintelligible] CSM and FMC? You see, Sam and I still on talk, whatsoever. We want to go down to trust route, so IIS integration in FMC is big for us. We've done a few [unintelligible] on that. You know, either both of us [unintelligible]. But we haven't gotten very far on the integration thing. So ideally we want to use an IIS matrix for securing your tags. And apply that matrix to switches, firewalls, whatever supports it, and go more at the diagnostic. We're working on building up that policy matrix. It's very time consuming, a tedious process. Trying to understand all of the applications and what fits the model.
6; ;00:25:02,360 --> 00:30:01,520; ;That's for like a sample to test. We plan on fully integrating IIS on wireless, vpn... We're doing posture, we're doing profiling... We're planning on integrating with FMC and having it manage policies. So, I don't think we have an exact picture of what that's going to look like. So we have a lot of testing to do yet. I was just trying to get more clues, because the architect's going to be swinging by and paint the picture of what they're kind of looking for in the future. But, you know, if you think about it, really looking for an automated way of introducing policy, right? If you look at it now, you can tell that there's a lot of manual steps in the whole process, right? When we take traffic and then maintain that separation and segmentation throughout the network and then at the same time apply IPS, IDS, threat policy based on risk. I'm going to say, yeah, largely ,what we're looking to do is consume the content IIS collects. I'm assigning any connect agent to installed on those points. You know on that IIS profiling, we're looking to capture, consume more data to make our IPS findings a little more accurate. To cut down all problem that the monitoring guys see, you know, actually alert real offenses, [unintelligible] saying, "hey this might be a thing because it is a Windows system." No, [unintelligible]. That level of old perks. It is, especially when it comes to [unintelligible] with the points, right? How do we then share contacts between systems, right? As one says, I'm going to say it like, what I have is a better picture of what the actual host is. Because when we talk about impacts, right? We should help those teams. The only fire [unintelligible] was wrong when it has he host identified wrong. FMCs overall discovery is pretty good. Active scanning obviously would give you a better picture but we don't want to do that twice. So how can we share systems between the two to lower their impact flight. And one thing that we're working on too is to try to lower that. I again...the vision really...in Cole's perspective Mark Luther will be here. And a little bit it's really just kind of get automated, get faster, get better so we can shave some man hours. So, I think your team doesn't see...you haven't been monitoring at all, there's no monitoring. Not an alert and no monitoring. FMC monitoring...my team is... So we have traps set up, we have polls set up, we use [unintelligible] and prime. So we do...we monitor but it's...the syslogs are more like retroactive, it's... If there was an issue, okay I'll pull the syslog and see what happen. It's reactive more than.. Yes, exactly. So could you talk a little bit about that? How do you do it there, the [unintelligible]? So, unfortunately we have CSM and we have FMC. So it makes troubleshooting issues complicated if you don't understand the environment. So if we know it's rolling through an ASA we would go on CSM we'd validate the rules. If we see the rules are there but we still see or they still say they're having an issue, we'd load up CSM event viewer or go into Cue Radar. Both kind of offer the same type of thing for ASA. Say if we go into Cue Radar we find that their traffic is being blocked, but we have to investigate further. We might log into the ASA and check the access control policy to make sure the rule actually exist and it's in the right place. If it's FMC...FMC is a little bit different right now. There's no way to query the rule base. So to find if a rule is there when you've got 500 rules on one ACP policy, it's almost impossible. If you know the object name, you can cross-reference it, you can search the object database with the content of the object. You can then go into the FMC FTP policy and use the search tool for the object, but you can't search for IPs within an object, within a network. You can't query for source destination. I want to say does this source have access to this destination over this application or this protocol. There's no way to do that. So in a lot of cases it's, "I don't know, I can't find the rule in here." Let me open up Cue Radar because FMCs connection events doesn't have enough historical data. It can't hold enough data. We can't rely on FMCs eventing. We have to go to Cue Radar. Cue Radar doesn't support FTE, FTEs or FMCs so we e-stream the data to Cue Radar.
7; ;00:30:01,520 --> 00:35:57,560; ;Cue Radar can't parse the data properly. So we have all these issues with logging that make it very complicated. Fortunately we can parse the initiator IP, the responder IP, and the service. So we're able to search Cue Radar based on the data and see if we got it allowed or blocked and continue troubleshooting. So that's kind of the FMC environment. It's a little bit more complicated because the usability of the tool isn't there like it is in CSM. So even...do you still send...even CSM and ASA logs to Cue Radar or... And that's just because the events stored, we only have maybe two tera-bytes worth of storage within CSM environment. I'm not sure what we have in the FMCs environment, but right now with six firewalls we get six hours to look back. And that's with some settings we've tweaked from tech's perspective to basically max out what we can store. Six hours is not a reasonable bar of times. So, we have to rely on Cue Radar's logs. Just passing the data off to Cue Radar. So, mostly reactive [unintelligible]. [Unintelligible] if they're triggered do they actually open a ticket, like how do you get, or is it an email? They're usually email alert. So memory CPU, connection counts, device fails over... So we have some traps configured where actually... I don't think we have this configured on FMCs whatsoever, trappings for solo runs for specific events. But on the ASAs we have traps set up where it would fire off an alert or it would alert solo runs and then we get an email alert. We also have a team that monitors the solo run dashboard. So there's some fields where you can see the tap devices by CPU, tapped with some fields like that, that we would have an L2 team proactively monitored. But when it comes to actually consuming the logs and troubleshooting an issue, it's definitely after the fact. So if somebody is complaining, we need to figure out what's going on and dig in the logs a little bit. So it's not that we're...we definitely don't have a team standing by actively looking at the logs. And I think [unintelligible] does to an extent. But I don't know, I guess, how deep they go. Especially with their FTEs because they haven't mention anything about the malware we see in our log sending there. So, I don't know if they're not alerting on that, I'm not sure. I'd like a little more understanding on that too, you know, as we build a better work flow and kind of utilize, especially Cue Radar more and more and more. I would love to see what that work flow will look like. Maybe we can take some lessons learned from what they're doing now. And then apply to logging [unintelligible] so we're just not logging the log, right? We don't need to waste bandwidth if data is not needed or not being used. We [unintelligible] to log 13 months worth of syslog data for connection events. So, allows, denies, we need that [unintelligible] log be BPTI compliant. Regardless if somebody's sitting there, actually doing something to log, we have to log most of the data. Could we be doing more with the logs to make our environment more secure? Absolutely. I mean, like I said, it's me as an FT and two consultants managing 2600 firewalls. So we don't have the bodies we need, that's why we need this formal team. The request for the formal team was a formal network security team, a formal network monitoring team, a formal route switch team, a formal wireless team, and we got one out of all those so... It's still going to be a lot for our team to do it all. The network security team is always [unintelligible]. Yes, but not really right now. We still straddle all the teams, we're still on an on-call rotation with another 15 FTE that are on our L3 team. We're still expected to be experts in all networking technologies, we support 13 major enterprise technologies. And we all have to know them in and out. But that's been a problem for us historically, because we haven't been able to specialize as much as we should. So it's put us in a place where our network team has grown, our [unintelligible] has grown much faster than our network team. So we still have the same amount of bodies as we did when had 200 stores when I started. Now we've got 1300 stores. We've opened up a dozen other branch offices and remote sites. But yet our team doesn't grow, the amount of tools and devices we support grows. And right now we've got about 27,000 devices our 12 FTEs are responsible for. Now that includes basically every networking technology. So DNS, DFCP, IP address management, firewalls, routers, switches, load-balancer, proxies, umbrella service now, IIS, [unintelligible]. So it's like a million things all on our monitoring servers. You guys are also responsible for installation of the device? So we do have data storage... We do have a data center team that does the cabling and that technically could rack the hardware for us? In a lot of cases we want to rack our hardware ourselves and we want to plug the cabling in. So we'll let them do the...run the cables to and from...a lot of cases we'll let them rack the hardware too. But me might share the responsibility of racking in and we would always plug our cables in. Because it's not as simple as go to port one. And the ports are never labeled, right? So you on-board the devices yourself? Yes. What about upgrades? Given the fact that you have 2600 firewalls and like maybe15 FTE devices opposed to that. Yeah, we do that too. I mean we [unintelligible]? There's an L2 team that helps us do the upgrade. So we have an L2 team they're responsible for patching.
8; ;00:35:57,560 --> 00:40:02,120; ;So we give them direction as to what code we want to run and they would start deploying it. But, using CSM as an automated deployment, we can only do 10 firewalls at once. And it takes like 2 hours to do 10 firewalls in CSM. I can do 10 firewalls on my desktop within three minutes. So we basically hired...or when we have to go through major upgrades like this, we might hire a couple dedicated L2 guys to do the off hours. And get them done within a month and a half. So the problem is when a critical vulnerability comes out. Right now we're running cold with critical vulnerabilities. We can't upgrade the night of. There's no...we don't have the capacity to do that. So every time it's like we upgraded, it takes us a month of dedicated engineer working eight hour shifts. I pray nothing happens when we do it. Yes, and by the time we're done, boom, another critical vulnerability comes out and we have to go through the whole thing again. So it's a never ending thing, especially within FMC and FTE. The amount of vulnerabilities that come out for the tool, and the amount of updates that you guys release so often, makes it very difficult to stay current. For the FTE? Yes. So, on...so do you guys try and maintain a single version like it is the altered specific version, you do that? They support it, yes. We try to, we've replaced all of our 9X series with X series or 4100s. Sorry, I didn't mean the model number. I mean what about the... Yeah, I guess they relate to each other. The old 9X series don't support newer code. So we have to kind of have like, "Hey all of our 8.2 firewalsl and below are running this code and our 8.4 firewalls and above are running this code." So we try to maintain consistency across the X series and 9X series. But right now, we've replaced all of our 9X series. Now we're running 9339 in all of our environments and there's a critical vulnerability that's just released and we have to upgrade them all over again. I'm [unintelligible] which is you do not actually use CSM to run [unintelligible]. No. To specifically do it in person. You still have resources to have it. Yeah we have not got a lot of success on using CSM, [unintelligible]. So, I mean we try doing like 5 firewalls a month and then we have some issues in 4.7. And we do the patches and the tech engineer [unintelligible] the maximum that he can do. That is in this day and age 5-10 firewalls per job. And even that we would have failures on firewalls. And then in folder tool we haven't really tried many firewalls. But when we did like 4-5 firewalls using the emails manager from folder tool, we didn't have much success either. So we excited to having additional bodies and telling everyone... So in that case, how do you...how do they actually do it? Is it as easy as the end-phase? Radiv, that's a stage... So first they will... I mean, I think the efficient team versus the email team for the local store... So we have some [unintelligible] limitation where we can't transfer what's going over the plan, we've got two firewalls on site at every store. And the traffic from here to the store is using a T1. So you have 144Mbit/second. We maxed out the T1 trying to push the file. So we have to push the files off ours to a local server on site. So that way we're not pushing two files, we're pushing one. Like home grown staging. Yes, we have multiple virtual servers there, we just dump it on one of the virtuals running TFTP or FTP or FTE or whatever protocol. Those running TFTP at that time, then it's on the local network. And then we have the L2 engineers log in to each firewall, copy the code over and then reboot and reverse. But they never wrote a script to automate any of that. [unintelligible] use the script to push the email to the... I don't know what those file logs are for.
9; ;00:40:02,120 --> 00:45:04,240; ;Through the server yeah. He uses a script...[unintelligible]. And the L2 team [unintelligible] was the lead using...we don't know the upgrade... So, he would copy the [unintelligible] to the local firewalls and that night they will upgrade all those firewalls. Yeah, because I was talking to him...I thought James had a better soul for that. That's what I meant, yeah. You know we could write a script to go out there and to log into every single device, but... Then we still need to validate whether there's something going on or not. We could write a script for that too. Of course someone has to be open. Some guys should be up, but you're right. Do you [unintelligible] how do you do the FGD and FMC itself? So with the FMC we have not upgraded yet, we're scared to upgrade. What version was it? 6.2.0 and the FTDs we have upgraded one but now that they're in production, we're kind of nervous to upgrade them too. So we're running 6.2 on most of them. I think one pair we're running 6.1, we need to upgrade. I just think we want to schedule a change and we have to work with Cisco to try to understand if there will be any impact, we don't have to expect impact. But again we're just not that comfortable with the upgrades. So we just, I don't know, I guess that's really the only reason we haven't done it. I think we just have to bite and pull it to do it now, because we have been talking about this since two months that we'll do the upgrade, you know. And I know that there are caveats but we have been discussing over, there are these caveats but... We can't find a solve for those. But I mean, two is...we have two different teams, I mean, Mark you're experienced with upgrading FMC... And they're seamless, other than your guys [unintelligible]. We're rectifying that, we're working on it. Yeah, I think our problem was we have this three additional layer of software. So we have this FXOS version that we need to upgrade, there's the FTD and then there's FMC. So, I guess what we want is a plan, an implementation plan. So we do our FXOS, and we do FTD and then FMC or like you know vice versa. So I would say the documentation for that is pretty good. From my experience having done the FXOS, the FTD and FOS, the full stack of them now, having moved from 6.0 to 6.2.1 on these.... [unintelligible] Yeah so, get rid of FXOS, it's a pain in the ass for all your customer not just us. It is...it's another layer that you have to worry about. Get rid of FXOS... No, you need to have that FXOS. With the FMC so that we can do the upgrade seamlessly... There's no way to consistently manage the policies in FXOS because it's not managed by FMC. So the platform setting, and the PCI compliance of that devices posture; are all handled in platform settings within FXOS. I'll give you that, I would love a manager for all of those. And in every single deployment we do, there's going to be inconsistencies in it. So the same...also they manage...there's a [unintelligible] manager that you have to make changes to? Ok. Also, we have... That hardware they're running on, we could run FTD on. It's the same exact same hardware except they buy it with... Oh the 9300? Yup. We're running with some 736 in there. Who? Sonny. Oh, yeah. Here in the featured [unintelligible], I just saw it. Yup. Sonny [unintelligible] You mention documentation, you guys report documentation quite a bit... Yes. You guys have definitely the best documentation any [unintelligible] you've ever looked at, so it's very helpful. Really thorough, yeah. But on FTD/FMC side, I felt it has been a bit lacking. There have been some things with upgrade procedures that we felt were not accurate on the website or could be detailed more clearly on the website. So we have ran some scenarios like that where...it's like we're deploying features as you guys are writing documentation. And one thing that I would like to...sort this for the documentation team, I guess is that I'm not a big documentation reader nor like going hundreds of pages reading it. But there are certain things that you should not do and maybe should be on the [unintelligible].
10; ;00:45:04,360 --> 00:50:04,290; ;When you are trying...do not do this because nowadays the FTD/FMC documentation is like you have six or seven different teams, different clip notes. And then you have to take that item and then they'll write this whole book to do upgrade from 6.2... I mean, minor fixes you'll have that whole book, so you have to read that whole book to... I did spend about a week reviewing documentation two or three times for our upgrade to 6.2, before I went: "Okay, I think I know exactly what we're going to do, fuck it up." "I'm going to open a critical and I'm going to write [unintelligible] ass now because I need this working again." you know? See, that's why he has a smooth experience. Here's the thing, I mean I don't know how the latest bug fixes are coming up but two months they were coming every 15 days. So I was like, "Do I have to read this documentation which takes a week, every other week?" And that wasn't fun at all. I have other things to do apart from reading documentation which will only relevant for that [unintelligible]. As we moves to the other...the next...seriously give us a real deal. [Unintelligible] Do not do certain thing right? When you're upgrading from this version to this version, you know, summarize the caveats. Don't make us go through the whole hundreds of pages of documentation. Can I share with you the joke that was an email yesterday that generated a whole bunch of emails? So, [unintelligible] to the costumer. And in paper, and at the very end of the form it said... In paper, at the very end of it, it said, "If you're not familiar with the instructions please click here" You saw that one too? No, I haven't exactly... So the responses back were. Are the customer's fingers HTML 5 compliant? Mark, her [unintelligible]. Yeah, work with their manager and their network architect here. Yeah, thanks for coming out. [unintelligible] I'll be kind of jumping in and out throughout the day. Right now I'm just trying to understand the workflows, how you guys create translations of change management, auditing all of that. Our engineer is a little bit [unintelligible] once he comes in [unintelligible] line by line based on the sort of feedback he will be giving us, so we will be going through [unintelligible]. Do you guys use CLA? On the [unintelligible], yes. For troubleshooting? Yeah. I have another question on the FTD side of things. How do you deploy FTDs, what are they doing for you? How are you using them? So right now we've got... [Unintelligible] deploys, right? I mean... So just saying like how are we using the product itself, what are we doing with the tools. So we did a PLC, we already deployed a couple of FTDs, and then we, few weeks later we started this POV or PLC for our store environment. So we're running 5505 at the store right now, we use them for segmentation. They don't support TLS1.2, so we have a $10 million budget basically to replace the firewalls with something that supports TLS1.2. Well, there's no value add in having the firewall support TLS1.2 for managements. We wanted to use some of these new features. So, beyond segmentation, we have... Right now we're running application rules, we have a DNS filter on it, we have... Right now we're basically just using it for segmentation and then we're monitoring the [unintelligible] feeds. That's all we are doing at the store level. We want to use some of the next features, the [unintelligible] feeds and actively block traffic. Do you mean it will [unintelligible]? It's in [unintelligible] as well, and then we're running file inspection. We're trying to understand if we're going to have value from that or if [unintelligible] team thinks we shouldn't use it, there's no value add to it. We're going though this debate right now, but we do have application based rules. We have AMP on, not blocking, monitoring, and then we've got [unintelligible] feeds not blocking but monitoring. Like I said, nobody is actually consuming that data and tweaking it to actually block to see if it can block.
11; ;00:50:04,290 --> 00:55:04,170; ;So we're not really using any action features other than... Visibility? Yeah, visibility on these and then application based rules along with layer 3 and layer 4 walls. So that's at the store level. In other environments we've deployed this. Our Equinix card exchange which will be multiple card providers and it does have an internet connection or a WAN connection, lets call it unsecure WAN connection out to Equinix. So we want an FTD there, the Google environments that are out there, do they have Internet access and come through this firewalls to get to enter all resources. So, one of the host could be compromised, so we do have AMP running on those boxes. We have application based firewall rules, we have layer 3 and layer 4 based firewall rules. And then we have the same scenario with [unintelligible] feeds monitoring not blocking, AMP not blocking. Just kind of giving us visibility to traffic walls. Ideally we'd go back and tweak those and put them to block, as long as you are not causing any issues. So that [unintelligible]. It's a PLV. So, we worked with competitor checkpoint, to basically compare two products. And seeing how their tool works versus how your tool works and compared to what we're used to which is the ASACS environment. And right now the biggest challenge FMC has is the management [unintelligible] user experience meeting, so that we can tell you some of, many of the features that we want to be integrated. Yeah, now that I think about it, I don't think we have a lot of FTD issues. It's more of a, yeah it's the management side. I mean, I haven't seen much issues with FMC. It's, you know, whenever we're trying to do something... Like regular day to day task, adding access control policies or looking at access control rules inside that policy those kind of, you know, headaches. I think you touched on some of that when you were talking about that you are having [unintelligible] something clear. And especially because we have the cluster environment, so we have active FTDs. And we have to troubleshoot both of them at the same time. FMC doesn't really give you that ability easily. I feel like FMC... You can not use the tool with one tab, you'll have to have like at least four tabs open at all times to use the tool effectively. Which becomes very [unintelligible]. Yes, yes, you're looking at ACP policy in one, you're looking at the object database... And you have to have the object database open at all times if you're looking at the HP policy. You might have connection events in one and they might have another, I don't know, do you have the fourth one? I usually at least have those three up. But a lot of times when troubleshooting something, I end up with just an entire Chrome of FMCs for the same FMC trying to troubleshoot both. So I might have a troubleshooting tab open for one FTD, I might have another troubleshooting tab open for the FTD [Unintelligible], new package captures. One of our enhancements is to kind of bring the clusters together to troubleshoot them at the same time. So we do a lot of tab captures, being able to issue a packet capture on a cluster versus each individual FTD. Would be very beneficial, because it's kind of pain in the ass to go in there to this issue that is getting captured twice. I'm doing it from CLI but there's no way to do it. Yeah, not in the... So we talked to Shaun Hendricks and he basically made it seem like: "Yeah, we wanted to get rid of the CLI, so any features you guys are using in the CLI, let us know so we can make it available on GUI." And that was a big one for us, it's the packet capture on the cluster. And one of the commands we use in CLI wasn't in [unintelligible] RAM because by default it stores on the RAM and we had SSD [unintelligible]. And the RAM was filling out quickly, and we had to move from the RAM to SSD and that command was only on the CLI. You said you were running it via script or [unintelligible] No, there's command uses like type and move. So that was the first FTD that we deployed? [Unintelligible] There's no command [unintelligible] So that's a flex config option with an FMC but it only supported flex configs. You can't just have any config go out there that supported on ESA or that supported CLI, it has to be supported flex config. [Unintelligible] Yes, like in the CSM environment I can put anything in there and it's going to deploy it.
12; ;00:55:04,170 --> 01:00:05,710; ;It does have a syntax tracker in CSM. I think FMC has a syntax tracker but it's just very restricted as to what exactly you can do, you can’t do VPN filters related to VPN funnels, so a lot of our GSP environment... We weren’t able to do what we want from an IP perspective on the FTDs because we can't filter the traffic we want. I don’t know if you guys are familiar with GSP or AWS, the way they do VPNs. The [unintelligible] funnel is basically encapsulated into one security association. You can't have two security associations with two F. IPs. It’s all in one, therefore your encryption domain and your ACL has to be one source going to one destination. So the scenarios are,the encryptions may be any any... We have to apply another layer of security over that which would be a VPN filter. That's not supported by the FTDs, so we had to move the IPsec funnel off the FtDs and out of the ASRs. I think we're deploying IPsec VPN and EHRP like a month after these features were released. [Unintelligible] Well yeah, it's supported with the flex config only... VPN was supported, but flex config, we used for the ADRPs. Yeah, now I'm thinking right now, some enhancements on the flex config side too. It's still kind of a pain to make it work. I’d slaughter I think some of the vision of what we want the end and security goal, now that you are in here – I am not sure how long you're going to be here for... But if you can paint like a picture of what the dream state would be, like limiting some of these manual tasks... [Unintelligible] So, the goal is really to get these guys out of the work stream. Does that makes sense? What we're really trying to do is get away from managing, [unintelligible]. So with the level set, we've got about... We got about 20 firewall requests at least that are processed every day. Throughout a year we process around 3000 requests. 2000 or 10000? The numbers are extremely high. We're do a lot of ACP changes, a lot of ace additions throughout the year, so... We literally, we have teams dedicated to coding rules and that's all they do all day long. So it's a very dynamic environment. That means you're getting so many requests for a... Yes, yes, at least 10 request per day, Monday through Friday at least 10 requests. So, the goal is really to get the team out of their work stream, right? We wanna set up more... Set up policies, entries for that when... When they are initiating services or they'ree building services, they add services, the environment kind of responds automatically, based on how... The category that they are [unintelligible]. We also want that, I guess we are standing up and give [unintelligible], we use ACI right now. They stand up and give an EPG to build a service, we want that service to essentially function... Based on, I guess kind of where they are located in the network. [Unintelligible] So it goes from ACI through managing contracts, all that, into our firewall that segregates attendance from the data center from their [unintelligible]. In that environment using [unintelligible] from all of that, to the rest of the environments. The security is essentially just almost pre-configured to a degree based on where we instantiate services. And when we look at things like [unintelligible] open shift which we're using. And all within that open shift path, right, security just happens, just happens, you know. [Unintelligible] the policies adapt because it's in that same kind of pocket [unintelligible]. The dream is obviously to allow that sort of expansion happen to them and to the categories, the groupings... The security's on, I guess, that replace the services in, all to expand and contract as the services do. Without these guys even having to be involved, because we've set up the framework for that security. And then obviously visibility throughout is another thing, right? That was always the vision of CSM, pulling in routers and firewalls and all of that, that was a big part of the initial draw. But tricking and bringing it to life, we are buying in the division of the eco system.
13; ;01:00:05,710 --> 01:05:21,170; ;I mean, this is the direction that we're talking about. If we were to have ACI and ISS and FTD running all these products... There should be [unintelligible], some sort of unified vision that gives us clear visibility and [unintelligible] six different projects and they stream together and all that. That's kind of the goal network. As we learn about FMC, CDO, ACI, CSM... I mean, they all seem like completely separate entities. So there are the integration points today and they will be there. But they all seem like they're completely different [unintelligible] and engineer teams. The products don't look alike. So I think everyone's going the direction of prime, at least the look and flavor of prime. So that's kind of what FMC looks like in a way. CDO looks totally different, ACI kind of looks like that same thing, but there are so many management tools. And to be able to enforce a consistent policy across EPGs and SCPs. It's something we want to do, actually. I know everyone talks about this single pane of glass and it's not a possible scenario. I think that’s what everyone wants in a way. You know, I guess, what's kind of setting the standard or changing, I guess in all. The perception of what or the expectations, I guess, of what is being asked from the infrastructure team. What's changing the industry, right? It's cloud, right? If I go to EWS or Google, [unintelligible] I add my things, this is a web server this is whatever. Security just happens for the application team, essentially off of that. So how do we provide that same experience? And truly make it a hybrid cloud where they don't really know what they're using, they don't care. [Unintelligible] exactly, exactly. But meanwhile we have to continue going forward and the policies that we currently have, we need to audit those as well. So, I think [unintelligible] is one of the biggest features that we will need so we can audit them as legal. What's interesting is all the customer references that we’ve had from FMC's side or really any customer that we’ve had using Cisco, even ESA It's like no one audits their firewalls. Not one of the customers had audit concerns, [unintelligible]. We don't really audit, we just kind of check the box as we get audited for PCI. But every year we get audited multiple times by internal and external vendors, and we have to provide evidence. Is there any, like strict... Exactly. From the PCI... [unintelligible]. We have to adhere to these policies to continue processing credit card transactions. Having some sort of audit capability, I don't know why... Even when I was in the CDO, CAC, the customer advising committee, I was the only person out of like 25 people that were there that... They had a big footprint that was interested in the audit aspect. So we were able to get hit counts added to the CDO product within the policy and it looks great. It's just interesting that no one seems to be concerned about... Okay, so you’ve deployed the rules, how do you actually make sure they're being used? How do you keep them clean? How do you restrict them down with some of the overly requests? There should be something kind of automated in there and it's... A lot of answers we got from CISCO are oh, there is third party tools for that. None of the third party tools we’ve looked at integrate well. We did a full on POV/POC last year. I think that was a small one [unintelligible]. So I mean... At that time, we were not able to get value out of those tools because CSM was not able to support... I mean, features that those auditing tools were providing, so now we are migrating to FMC, we are trying to get all our firewalls from CSM to FMC. And we're facing the same challenges. Yeah, FMC has nothing except overlapping or shadow. We have this grand vision of being [unintelligible] and of doing everything that like... I mean, if somebody starts a service or an application, we just want them to inherit all the policies along the line, from source to destination. But if we don't try to clean up the mess we have already created, how are we going to get there? Because we will end up with two different mess than just one and we have to focus on what we have and fix it. At the same time strive forward as well. It's all good in PowerPoint, though. [Unintelligible]
14; ;01:05:21,170 --> 01:10:04,380; ;Do you share work policies across [unintelligible]. Yes, so for the [unintelligible] today. CSM 1, CSM server, supports all 1300 stores, like almost 1400 stores. So we have one policy, an access control policy assigned to 1400 firewalls. Everything having to go to platform settings for HTP access list at the stage access list for version 2, the password policy, that're running flex config right now. Stuff like that are all policy based and they're all policy assignments, every single store has the exact same policy. It's very quickly covered, right now our firewall rules on the store level are by Supernet. They kind of encompass each store's little mini networks. So they're... we've come up with a policy that will fit all stores, and it's still secure. Are there exceptions [unintelligible]? Yeah, so some stores might have a proof concept. Project going on where they've got some new media wireless product. So right now we're doing a demo on some robot that we have in the store. That specific store might need a local policy along with the policy that's being inherited or shared to it. So there are scenarios where we do maintain a local policy along with the shared policy for PLVs or TLCs. One thing just to circle back totally off what you're talking about. This fire is like [unintelligible] and how we use them. I mean, not only head count, but the class access would be... Yeah, that's implied. We have just started [unintelligible] and we... And we have in this process of going from 4.7 to 4.12 and I guess ultimately to 4.13. And we were very excited about that, now we're trying to rule away. So, I mean, you know, that doesn't give us too much to use for the tool [unintelligible] away from it. [Unintelligible] Going back to square one and then again restarting. And that's, I mean, we've heard multiple arguments from your side saying, you know, there is third party vendors for a service like this. You guys are selling security products, why isn't there a way in the tool to make sure the security product you guys have are secure? They are not cheap, I mean, they're like 3, 4 million dollars, I mean... [Unintelligible] They are very expensive and the companies we've spoken to about those products have all had good feedback around them. And unfortunately they didn’t use CSMs, so they weren't really helpful for us. But, I don't know, it just makes sense. You guys are going into the direction of security, everything is security focused right now. Add security in your product, make sure the product you guys have is secure. We’ve asked on the CSM side compliance reports for different PCI... Or at least the inability to report on policy assignments we could say, "Hey PCI auditors, here's all of our policies, here's their assignment, boom." "PCI audit done." Instead we're stuck in conference rooms for weeks, proving this stuff, and getting them screenshots and sharing stuff over Webex. And it would just be nice to have something to just give them to say: "Hey, we're compliant, here's all of our firewalls, here's all the policy contents and here's their assignments." Yeah, twice a year we spend 15 to 30 days auditing our firewalls. And we do... I mean, CSM 407 had some auditing capabilities that we used to look at, and then okay, we'll work on that and then give to auditors. This is what, these are the modifications that we made. But now we don't have anything. You mean FMC or? Yeah, in FMC we don't have anything and that's... Our FMC is not PCI compliant at all. Our FTDs aren’t PCI compliant, they all have local passwords right now. There's no way to integrate them with hack X, there's no way to integrate them with ACS at all radius. FXOS even integrates with hack axe, but FTD and FMC doesn't. So there are some gaps on the products that would help them... I mean, it's going to be hard to sell that, we have to get exceptions for the local accounts. We're not supposed to use local accounts unless there's an event of an outage. I don't think it's impossible to do because we look at the complicated firewall like checkpoint, right? They have thit separate audit engine, they integrated all these like industries standards to the firewall, like PCI ideas and everything. And you look at the connection and it will just aspire to the buyer.
15; ;01:10:05,080 --> 01:15:07,870; ;[Unintelligible] All of the PCI violations, all the managed devices you have in the central management, right? Okay, this manage device has like [unintelligible] for this or like this. I mean, this is an industry standard. You're going to fix it once you know it's a list. And they are also policy based... They will have one consistent policy that they will apply over multiple firewalls, four firewalls for a certain reason [unintelligible] our policy is based in FMC where... You know, they will create certain policy rules that they can implement on the firewalls. And when those policies are applied to those individual firewalls, the rules that get hit on, they can look at which firewall it was... And how many times it was hit on, when was the last time it was hit... So I guess they have this engine in the back end that's pulling all that information for each individual firewall. But we have seen them doing it, so that's why we have the expectations. And when we talk about [unintelligible] across all the devices, or is it more device to device, the information of our data contents. Device to device. Yeah, you go to that individual device and then you look at that policy uses on that device or that rule used on that device. I think we'd want...both there. [Unintelligible] Yes, on the CSM environment it's... That was always difficult for us, because it is device by device. And then [unintelligible] on firewalls, so we did the PLV with them [unintelligible] did some firewalls. They have application [unintelligible] seem line and they have log in auditing in their seem line as well, so [unintelligible]. Oh yeah, [unintelligible] checkpoints. Yes. Checkpoints are definitely scored very highly on the auditing capabilities. A lot of features they have are exactly what we want to see in our CISCO environments. Kind of what we’ve been begging CISCO for since CSM 4.4. Just it's hard to get traction on the audit side. I don't know why but there isn’t a lot of interest for some reason and it just doesn't make sense. We wanna take ten minutes, I know we've been... I'm sitting here sweating as I'm drinking water. [Unintelligible] After the ten minute break can we understand how we pull [unintelligible]? And how do you [unintelligible] different systems [unintelligible]. Is there anyway you can [unintelligible]? I would like to see your view point on that, because obviously, that's what we are [unintelligible]. That isn't one of the top priorities. These guys trying to work around, it has the CLI version, the show access control policy, but it's just not, it's not legible. Like you can't, it's not [unintelligible] to correlate what CLI versus what’s on FMC – you shouldn’t have to go to two different places for the same firewall to be able to look at that. [Unintelligible] You can stop recording. Right, [unintelligible]. Yeah, can we just, I'll do that. [Unintelligible] So I am not sure if you can comment on the end of the process, but what we, the design team do is try to understand what does that mean from the features and if you have it and if it’s an enhancement we file it as such. We worked on designs for the features, and possibly if you guys have time you go and print it. But before we can even get through development, we bring it back to you. Have you guys run through it, run through the mock-up, usually applicable [unintelligible] so to get your feedback, okay, this does this one and does this one.
16; ;01:15:07,870 --> 01:20:00,360; ;[Unintelligible] and anything like that. That's what we handle most of the time, we work primarily on making sure that the design... Is there other developments you could make and does it work what you guys expect from a feature that comes up. So that's sort of what we look at, using expectations and meeting user needs. While our design...[unintelligible] We had that one pretty much handed off to engineering and they have like, they tried to do this [unintelligible]. And how that has started is based on whole bunch of things, we provide our sort of priority, based on what we think its important. There's also engineering priority, there is also part management [unintelligible] priority. So, these are things that, priority lists [unintelligible]. We tried those things and engineering fixed things up based on how many resources we have and such. That's sort of a rough way in which it goes from design through development. We're also trying... Our demos are coming back at the end from time to time, so if it's a big feature or a complex feature, we look after its development and while it is being developed we keep tabs with the engineering team. Just to make sure that, you know, we gave the design, they're developing it, and over time something is lost in translation. It may not come out as expected, from user stand point. So we're try and act as gate keepers throughout the process and at the end we might even bring it back to you [unintelligible] to have you guys look at various analysis which has been implemented. And actually see some of the features before they come out in terms of beta testing and such. Provide feedbacks so that we can... Yeah, it is usually there are quick fixes [unintelligible] during the beta we have support engineers that actually... We have engineers supporting the beta, who could actually fix [unintelligible]. [Unintelligible] So you guys have approval to become part of the beta program? So it's just matter of now just kind of setting up some of the frameworks and getting equipment and stuff, so what I am trying to make is sort of it’s a package. Are you working with the beta managers, because the beta managers have asked us to ask if you guys use it. If you'd like to be part of the beta program, we can get them connected to you. Yeah, we need to circle back and I talked to Shawn Henry and part of the process it's formalities, we have to fit into that and then figure out. We need to kind of move staff with us. Right, yeah. Before you can do that. That's where we are at right now, so we need to figure out what formalities we need to have done. There's a website that we can go [unintelligible] or something like that. [Unintelligible] I'm not sure it works with [unintelligible]. Maybe if your management is okay with it, we could have a beta manager connect with them and then... Yeah. It's basically signing an agreement at a corporate level that says we have [unintelligible] to remove them. [Unintelligible] or whatever, so then any feedback you can... And implementing features like as soon as they come out, like we are operating horizons and like all those kind of things. Some of the thing I was, you know, like when I was talking about housekeeping, right? You guys don't have a place to do a beta program in my opinion. You don't have a good set up lab. We can set up, I mean as we enroll the program, like you know how all the questions.. Yeah, at this point we do not have a good house lab. But we're looking at... So we just need to figure out what this is going to look like, right, that way we don’t end up... Like accidentally throwing this code on our production system. You guys will never do anything like that! I don't think we have done it in the past... I'm just saying, we need to make sure our house... Everyone needs to be a little how this happened [unintelligible] there's no break in business and such [unintelligible] for you guys. And then also make sure we have the right agreements in terms of what they are sharing. Some formalities but like I said you guys before, we're going to get you on the program, so it's not a... [Unintelligible] Seems that both pieces are going to be two months, or one month even. I am going to make sure that the upgrade process is streamlined everything. I mean, we're using this firewall on every possible environment that we can deploy.
17; ;01:20:00,360 --> 01:25:01,790; ;We're deploying it in the cloud [unintelligible], ACI, like so... We're testing this new generation firewalls in every environment we can test, and we are also... Maybe we might go into our branch store. [Unintelligible] So, right, like I said, what the next steps in my mind would be, is like sit down with Avan, say this is what we are going to need for an environment to do some of this stuff. This is kind of where we as a team can help out with some of the equipment. You guys might need to have this kind of set up and permanent like so it's not going to be turned up and turned down. And we agreed to kind of set up that kind of framework... I mean, it's formalities, but we need to have... We can easily accommodate that, we've got spare hardware, we've got switching, we've got the routers... [Unintelligible] We can [unintelligible] with internet circuits, right? Yeah. Isn't it an internet kind of circuit, like you said, right, that would be kind of part of the overall design, but as far as like... Completely isolated from our network. And beyond that this is something we're going to do with... It seems like you're delaying. Alright. That's all, right? Okay, I'm done. I'm off my [unintelligible]. I was going to be quick and suggest you guys just give us hardware to run beta equipment on. We're testing the program, does it include hardware? It can sometimes. It will. Okay. At least the source fire finds this. [Unintelligible] Let's have a meeting, let's figure out what the design would look like. No, we need, we use here. We will get a meeting here, what the design would look like, incorporate the entire eco system, right, architecture. And what resources are kind of [unintelligible] so it's not just cycled. And then, we'll all talk with Kevin and he will figure out what, where the gaps are, And especially talk about like the store stuff coming up and then how we can cover setting up the environment. But I just don't really like saying "get you guys on the beta program", and then what, right? We're not even ready to do anything, it's just testing... Just to have a copy of the product doesn't really get you where you wanna go to actually work with the features and as we work with the features... We said we need IES, we need prime, we sort of set some of that up with my server and now... But I want just to make sure we have that fundamental set up and then we'll go. Right? So that's basically the process we follow. So what's the largest customer that you had [unintelligible], what's the number [Unintelligible] [Unintelligible] I mean, I will assume that if you go to the largest customer that uses the FTD and get the feedbacks from them as well. We trying, so we're in a phase where we are meeting customers and getting feedback, so... I think the question comes and it is like, okay, how many customers have to request a feature to be like a priority or something like that? Because there are some features that are always showstoppers for us. You got forward with this deal, you know, like, there is still a big issue, like FMC can only acclimate a certain amount of firewalls. We cannot possibly have like multiple management platforms without any kind of synchronization in-between. Yeah, because there's no way to migrate our ESAs today to FTD, there's no CSM migration tool there's a limitation to the ASA migration tool which is 50.000 [unintelligible]. So we do have a somewhat work aroun, get around that, but it’s a huge pain in the ass. [Unintelligible] there's time for them, I have appointed that. Just stay on topic, maybe we'll address some of those. I think we wanna stay focused more on the usability, because... There's a lot [unintelligible], right, especially when it comes to talking about just... I don't know, pick your usability concern, but as far as it comes as a scale on platform stuff, [unintelligible]. [Unintelligible] You know, we can talk and amongst services through some of the synchronization...
18; ;01:25:02,090 --> 01:30:16,720; ;[Unintelligible] I mean, we're going to that process of having the synchronization, kind of automatic strips... If we wanna have a separate conversation with the services [unintelligible] engineering team. We can actually do that, but just, not just yet. So this is usability, this isn't scalability, let's try something else though with them. Because we meeting yesterday basically to make a decision, but yet we have not seen how we're going to manage this environment. So it's important to get a demo of how we can synchronize FMCs, yes, FMCs. It’s policies, etc, that’s something that we can't go forward without... One second. Hello? Oh God, it got me again. What's wrong with your credit card [unintelligible] we talked to you about it. They keep saying this is their final attempt. The final notice. I want to find you to answer your phone so we can talk to you. You get the same guy's voice, "This is the IRS calling, this is the final notice." "This is your bank." And it sounds like the same guy every time. He must be very busy, making phone calls like that. Tell them how much we can get into without going through specifics. I think we want [unintelligible] for that, I think you guys have heard a lot of our concerns, taking a lot of notes. But I think a lot of our usabilities are very specific. Yes, we definitely want to keep them into that. I just texted the director [unintelligible]. Sure. It's been great learning about your process that helps us as well, in longer perspective [unintelligible]. But interestingly, we haven't been able to find a company that will have a larger footprint than us. If we actually go through the purchase of placing all of our store [unintelligible] or a larger FTD footprints. Consumer side was going bad and I would think this purchase will give us some sort of... Leverage? Yes, leverage with CISCO in a way to get some of our features prioritized. That would be our hope, at least. Sure. I think you kind of saw that from the meetings we ran lately, right? I hoped that you have at least that expectation that talking to Shaun two-three times. Him wanting to partner with you guys, talking to, you know, Jason Lemar So far it's like getting prioritization, yeah, sometimes it's a challenge when it comes to... These things are pretty far, but I hope you're leaving at least with the expectation that... Cisco in general wants to address you guys more than others, especially when it comes to, you know, they are talking about bringing some usability concerns, fixing the January release, right? Which meaning they're talking about dead cycles for us, that’s pretty fast, right? As far as the other concerns, I think that the BU especially, especially when I talk to Shaun, he's called me a couple of times, they want to make sure you guys are whole. I mean, so, obviously a lot of that has to do with you, you caught this pending huge deployment. But when you start looking at that huge deployment, they really want to make that a showcase kind of deployment. Yeah. You know, this is how [unintelligible] and the price can go. So, if you need anything more like backing as far as priority is concerned, I will be happy to address that. But I think, at this point you, at least since CISCO's prioritizing you guys. I think we definitely believe that. Yeah, I mean, I will say there is enthusiasm to partner, but what I want, what we're saying is, like those features that are showstoppers, I talked to them also earlier, we want some kind of like work around. Already we wish, we want to start working on those, instead of talking about it. Because we know what those issues are. We have scalability issues, and all the talk went wherever that gap [unintelligible] has won. I will say, "Let's start working on one of those, you know, instead of saying look, this is a problem we have." And then we can discuss that any time we want but we know what the issue is. How do we synchronize the policies?
And then we can discuss that any time we want but we know what the issue is. How do we synchronize the policies? You know, that's just an example, of something else that we want to see. Okay, when we go into production with this, we'll have a deadline, it’s June 2018, we'll have to be able to replace all these ALC firewalls with the FTDs... Can we be able to, you know, sufficiently manage those firewalls or not? If we don't start this conversation right now, or, I mean, if we don't start seeing the real example of that, those top one priorities happening, then you know, we'll not be able to have a warm and fuzzy feeling about, you know, when we made the purchase.
19; ;01:30:17,240 --> 01:35:14,800; ;Yeah, I know that, some of them, some of them just can't be worked around, right? Like, especially with usability. You say dragged this thing and have it pop up. The work ground is really [unintelligible] we're trying to avoid. But I guess as we're talking [unintelligible] because they need to give you guys one of their [unintelligible]. I think it going to be difficult to demonstrate something that hasn't been developed. But I think it's easy to at least show "Okay, this is going to be a guarantee. " I wanna talk to the engineers, I want to know that what we want replicated is actually in their heads to replicate. So, this isn't just ACP replication, this is every single policy out of the box replication. Yeah, no I will be happy to hold that call by tomorrow. Because I don't think any of us can confidently say "yes", this is the tool for us. When we have to make the same change in 5 different places right now if we want the tool today. We are already shorthanded, and we said like any new network with tools that DNS, DSCP [unintelligible], you name it, right? We bring those tools, we don't bring the human resources to support those tools. And without the synchronization of policies we're looking at ten FMCs that we need to manage. Yeah, before... [unintelligible]. [Unintelligible] on the chart, like CSM environment and other ESAs.
Yeah, before... [unintelligible]. [Unintelligible] on the chart, like CSM environment and other ESAs. And unless we see the synchronizing 2 firewalls, I mean there are other issues also, roll back is one. [Unintelligible] by the trails... When, I mean, I say this with like, you know, nothing will happens, bu when something happens, what’s our back-out plan? Okay. And we did the... Yeah, that's more long usability, not scalability bar. I guess I don't know how deep you guys were willing to go right now into a gig right here. [Unintelligible] I know I'm digressing but we have to. And more important, now we have a next generation firewall, because we, when we had access control policy, now we have ten different policies in FMC. [Unintelligible] into that policy and file policy and all we have to [unintelligible], everything is a policy based on FMC. You know, we've been sitting here for couple of hours and I'm looking at the list right now. Wait, three of the top nine issues here are usability, and that’s why these guys are here for. And in the restroom platform as such we'll address those, I mean the ability to roll back changes. What I'm going to do is then maybe some of the time this afternoon, if we hit this, if you guys are okay. At least you guys understand, because I didn't, write the paragraph on some of the work around. You guys understand what it is, and if you don't then let me know, I will appropriately address it. Because I thought, most of this was kind of understood. It was understood by us, we just wanna make sure it's understood by you and whoever you are communicating. Yeah, so, especially that number one that we’ve talked about just now, the scale. Yeah. I'm going to have a meeting with the developers and you guys are going to understand that one. If there's anyone else, as long as we go down the list this afternoon. If there's something else that we're not clear on, or we're not addressing enough. So, will that point [unintelligible]. [Unintelligible] or General Metro? Milwaukee. Milwaukee I think, yeah. [Unintelligible] Okay, so yeah, he should be here soon. So, maybe you want to for lunch. Yeah, do you wanna tell him the, do we want to break now, because this is a good stopping point and go eat here and tell Greg to grab something on his way or would you want to wait for Greg to eat lunch? I think he's cool to grab something on the way, because I wasn't sure how we would do it. [Unintelligible] So do you guys wanna eat here or you wanna go somewhere? Doesn't matter. It's your choice. It’s easier to just eat here. Ok. So, you guys wanna go somewhere specific, there's a SiIk down the street [unintelligible]. What is this place? It may or may not have some dancers there. Not everywhere [unintelligible] You may or may not leave with that seat. You may or may not have glitters in your steaks.
1; ;00:00:01,225 --> 00:05:08,865; ;Source destination, whatever services that you are looking for. And so, in that access control policy, this rule is already allowed. We can even… And then expose that policy to the users to be able to check whether that global policy already allows that rule. I mean, global access is controlling your… No, I was saying the policy. I mean if the page would do that. I don't know if it's a separate dialog box that will appear after you click on that query page, but as long as it queries that policy and then  looks for whether that policy is allowed, if that rule is allowed or not. So right now, if I put the IP, it will show, like, where the object is, right? But there is only one IP. - There are seven pages here, so even if you –
- Right, if you wanted to do multiple, like, I mean, rule is not made by just one IP. It's a source destination [unintelligible] … Right? More than five layers, this is layer seven. So, there will be more than having URL. I… Basically, it's a query-builder kind of thing, where you can designate and/or… So that IP is based on... Should be in source or destination or application if you already know that you are looking for this particular application. And while we are here I think there's got to be the simplest fix for what they're asking for. But you see how it says “display 1 of 49 rules”? -Yes.
-Can it zoom out? Why can't that be selectable? Why can't – Try minus, minus. So, they can see all the rules in one page, right? ‘Cause we're now going to have to go... Where is the zoom? Right now? So, this is to display all the rules so that it can go down... At 50%, we can see around 18 lines. It's going to be tricky, but… I mean, you have this all this – why this space on the top? Let's not talk this way. Because the way the UI… You're the one to design that? No. Well, I totally understand. - Do I increase.  - Yes, because this internally... We can expand it, for sure. Like, make it intervals, make it two intervals, might be more, but how many scrolls obviously much harder to do… A policy is what like 2,000-3,000 rules. - I think I look... I always look I need something more
than [unintelligible 00:02:35] Yes. You know, I think – So, let's go back to the… Maybe to the Access Policies page. If we can do that and go to the Access Policies page. So in here you can generate a report, right?
The report that is in there is like, 70, 80 pages and is not legible. So, if in that policy, maybe in some way, instead of that policy being 100 lines of scroll, maybe if we can query that rule, and then it creates another dialog box, which gives that, instead of when somebody trying to make these changes, I guess… I don't know how it works in the back end, when you are doing the services. [unintelligible] But for certain queries we need, you can create the whole page with the policy. Because, when we do that PDF generation, it's not legible at all. Got you. That goes the same with XOS, right? Exporting the policy to Excel. Yea. Then also like, sometimes like, you know, like, people will ask like, ok. Can you send us the... all your access rules, access control policies? And we have to generate that, and like, I mean, maybe just copy and paste, right. Just yesterday, right? - Copy this. And just like ok, these places are all the rules. Or something like that. Just yesterday, we were in this, this is a CS, this is our cloud exchange firewalls. So, these are directly behind the Google instances, Google cloud instances. So yesterday they asked the question, we have any-any [unintelligible] on the bottom of this page. So they asked how… When are you going to remove the any-any? So, if you could provide the report that is legible to the project managers, then we can say, “If these rules look good to you and your app team, in the Google team, maybe we can remove the any-any. You know? Or something like that. But right now, it's all in monitoring and  we have any-any rule, so the firewall  is just there to have visibility in the application rules. - I'd will believe that today… - I think we have that. It's under, like, enhancement or something. If we have it, let's just stay on it and [unintelligible]... - Yeah So, I was just adding that in the query page, because maybe that was just integrated… Actually, do you want us to get counts per device or just for profit of policy?
2; ;00:05:08,985 --> 00:10:02,340; ;So, in checkpoint , we were discussing this earlier… So, you have a policy that is applied to several devices, in this case stores, you know of course, data center device, firewalls. And then in those devices, if you click on that individual policy rule, it will tell you this device has – for this rule, it has this many here. So I don't know how much deeper that you can get to in terms of selecting devices and doing that kind of stuff. We were still open to, cause we're taking our plans from [unintelligible] so, it's our job to test ways. But, if the policy is shared in the beginning, I guess as long as the rule is being hit in somewhere in the firewall, because now you are sharing… When you talk about policy, then you are sharing it across multiple firewalls. So as long as we know that one of the firewalls – if that crew last yesterday or the latest day when it hit, that's good enough for us right now. So, yeah. He wants us to get away from CLI. The only way to see the accounts is to use CLI or to build individual ATP account tables or... That comes under the auditing feature, because if the rule has not been hit in the last six months, then why keep it there? So what you guys are saying is: the workflow in the CLI is exactly what you need right now. We just need to fall into that. -The workflow in the CLI?
-I mean, the troubleshooting steps in the CLI is... - No. If you do a [unintelligible] policy on CLI, try to correlate that with the actual access control policy, it's not as easy as just looking side-by-side. I don't know. I think it's their accounts page, look at the accounts from CLI, I mean, Mohan can pull up one of our FTDs and show you what the outline looks like. But what I would like to see... I'm sorry I don't know where you guys left off in this conversation, but in the rule base I want to see the hits, similar to what we get in CSM. Refresh the account under a specific rule, and you can actually see if that rule is being used or not. And then you should be able to see kind of like micro frozen match up rule. So if your rule is 10/8, and you see 10.1.1.1.1. hit that rule, it should show you that 8 10.1.1 hit that rule. Not that this rule was used because we want to eventually tighten up those rules. And if we have an any-any, how do we audit it? We have to use connection events, we only have six hours go by, blah blah blah. That is tricky. But okay. Did you guys already capture this? I just captured this. But it was not discussed earlier. - This is interesting. But I think that a lot of the things that we are asking for can be... because I did on several stages. But at first, we want to be able to see the hit-counts in that particular rule of the policy, and then we can go from there, when we drill down to that rule. Which device is using that rule for... in that policy? And then what are the traffic being used? That comes... then it is going to query the events also in the backend, to look at that, right? Which firewall, I mean, those are the things [unintelligible] question. Is there... - Would you like to see the outcome from the time when the rule was created or it only matters for the past six months? Because in the past six months, it doesn't give you good auditing… …[unintelligible] tighten it, and only last six months is what we want. Or is it something which from the life of when the rule was created, till now? I might say research in months would be, or window there just in case, God forbid, we have a process that runs once a year. If you're cleaning up every six months, somebody is gonna go: oh, it hasn't been hit in six months. We don't need it. And then, you know, come tax season, we're actually quick building or remove that rule. So right now, we have a policy in place that says: hey, you have to test all the firewall rules, otherwise we're ripping them out. We don't have anything like that for app teams, people think you put it in, it's there forever. The only time we actually rip hit-count rules out... the last time we did it was probably four years ago because... in our environment, CSN was never accurate when it depicted hit counts. It would show zero hit counts when there would actually be hit counts that do show access list. So there was kind of some issues on the CSM side that prevented us from moving forward with actually removing rules unless we did CLI-based audits. The CLI is always accurate. But CSM was never accurate. So, Avosec's workflow, the workflow that Avosec has, is when you saw that 0-hit-counts rule. You created a ticket for that rule. In the backend, it integrated with services now, and open a service ticket to say okay, this rule we are going to remove this rule for, decommissioning that.
3; ;00:10:02,460 --> 00:15:00,010; ;I mean,  I know that you guys, I mean it's open now. So, maybe you should be able to integrate the service, now. So whenever we are decommissioning that particular rule in the policy, maybe in the backend we can give you the ticket. So that way we can keep track of rules that we are removing, and even if we are removing that rule, even if we have to put it back, we can tie that, take it back. And that is something we can totally give to L2 when you get to that level, right? When you have open tickets, to remove… Not just, “Oh, look I added this rule, so I know that rule is not being used, so I can remove it.” You guys want to pull anything in from the CLI to the group, please don't take it out of the CLI. I spend 90% of my time in the CLI, so to lose feature already there I don't think any customers are saying, “Get rid of the CLI!” I mean even beyond that, I end up dropping in expert mode a lot on your boxes. So… A lot of the troubleshooting, you know, like, updating search, because every time I've updated the search for the GUI, it crashes the entire box. [unintelligible] So, you mentioned the ability to see the part of the objective first set. And the rule has like 5... - If [unintelligible] and interesting example: we built work flows within a connection to that or within the event… to kind of… Find itself that kind of any-any.[unintelligible] We don't want to have to have workflows for every single rule. It's PCI requirement to log every single rule, so you have to know when a rule's being hit. You have to retain those logs for 13 months, so we want to, at the very least, log… Allow some blocks so we have some sort of loopback troubleshooting data, and that PCI historical data. But the ability within the ACP policy to see that the rule is hit from a network content's perspective – so if I have an object that has, like, 15 different networks in it, I want to know which one of those network's hit, and it'd be nice to know which IP in that network hit. So kind of understanding the actual connection. That will be helpful... Each time it does it or just the last it would be? I think the last hit is – the last hit date for each flow is good. That's what we've got as a CSM. You could see all of the flows that match that rule from a hit count perspective, and it looked like it worked great. It didn't work as good as it looked, but it looked good. And then if somebody modifies the rule, last to modify, who did it? In CSM, we have a ticketing setup. It's a ticketing system that integrates with ServiceNow. We basically put the ServiceNow URL, and then we key in our specific string, which is going to be an ST task number that you have to get signed with somebody. As we code firewall requests, we have them create an activity with the FC task name. So… And they also reference that FC task in their description rule. So every single rule, you can basically click the ticket, it pops open ServiceNow from a link, and then boom. You see the actual ticket, who requested it, who coded it, who approved it, everything having to do with the rule. One thing to do with AC Policies requirement is to comment every time… We do that. We have a request around that, the ability to delete comments. Because right now there's no ability to delete comments, and we do a lot of rule copies. So we end up with 15 different comments that don't even explain the rules anymore. I mean, the most recent comment will explain the rule, but previous 14 comments have nothing to do with the rule anymore. Modify the search…[unintelligible 00:13:36] - CSM has a team… [unintelligible] Or at least, ‘cause I understand, like, you really don't always want certain people to do sometimes the comments from a [unintelligible] or some people say allow a customer to delete it. [unintelligible] Yeah. We turn t at on and off a couple of times, just because we've had to manipulate the login rules, so we had to enable login every single time for, like, 200 rules individually. So that's another request I'd like to make. The ability to highlight multiple rules, and then enable each of those rules, like, enable log at this level [unintelligible 00:14:17] It took me about four hours, on every single rule to go back and add the login to make everyone log in. [unintelligible] tabs for greyed out everything above action in inspection login. Basically, those are the ones that could be [unintelligible] - Inspection login?
- Yeah. Yeah. So, click on inspection login, click on inspection. So you got your file policy and truth policy and variable set. Yeah. So I had to do the same thing. We had to enable IPS on every single rule and I had to double back and go through and enable login. Yeah. Are majority of your rules have the same IPS policy applied?
4; ;00:15:00,546 --> 00:20:00,800; ;For us, it's exactly the same. But again, we haven't worked with you guys to define the policies, we're just going off what you said, and we just enable every single rule that makes sense. So some of the rules that doesn't even make sense to have IPS policies on, or file inspection policies, so we didn't enable any, but majority of the rules, yes. We have one file policy and then we have one attribute. That's a separate request. I'm gonna highlight… I'm gonna go back to topic, right? So if this went back to global policy, and it was one boxset and it's override-able, I think that would be the winner, right? If you said that from the global policy perspective, those tabs, then per rule override… - that only I that would be the …
- That would be the...
- I still like the idea of multiple selection. Yeah, just highlight the bulk, but I also like to say ‘Hey!' an auto one hundred here at home need this I don't want to go through ten. Select 10 and change it once again. I think a lot of the control click and the copy and paste stuff here needs more improvement. So, okay we have full… Yeah, I think in the beginning of the POC, we're looking at number of clicks that's required to create a rule for Cisco or [unintelligible]... I think it's going to require like four or five clicks to create the rule boxes, but Cisco requires 26. Yeah... Watch me create a one single rule, it took me 23 minutes. 23 minutes for one single access control policy rule. Well, it's definitively not time-saving. All right, if this was not self-explanatory… - It is. Well, then I think we're all pretty clear of the workaround. Again, that workaround, to me, is not a feasible workaround. We deploy this firewall 10-15 times a day. Saving copies of the policy before every single deployment is not feasible. Reverting to a previous database and having all of your firewalls revert is not a feasible option, so… How many firewalls do you need? Twenty. Twenty per day, so 100 per week. Fifty-two weeks in a year, that's 5,200 across the year. I think one year we did over ten thousand firewall requests. So I guess that the biggest after this, Well… well, it shows. I think that's what you call a critical mass, right? Of all the things that's on here that say different things, they say if you, like, highlighted one particular one, you delete any acceleration possible. I think this would be acted out so number one. We only go forward, never look backwards, right? You know, I go for… I think we need a new firewall. One second. Do we have anything more to say about that? And again, a lot of our priority one stuff, I don't think these are call-specific. I think any customer is gonna benefit from all these changes, and they make sense. But what we need to discuss is we definitely need to have a cabin and a document that writes down how frequently do you want to copy the policy or what is our approach to it, you know, when we decide to go to Cisco. Because, I mean, it looks we're not getting anything until at least a two-months period, and then it might hit the… So, right now, what we'd end up doing is restoring the entire FMC as they back out, from the day before, because we're not replicating all the policies before every deployment. That would not be feasible. We overrun something right away. So that is something we need… The actual PROD policy for [unintelligible] We have to work on a back-up plan. I think that the workaround is we're gonna have to come up with a solid… Well, I mean, not yet, but we will. Because in the CSM world, the rollback feature probably didn't work the best, but we did use it often. And if we didn't use that, we at least use the activity report to see who did what exactly, and reverse the changes by coding them. We don't have the ability within FMC to do that. An example of that is, we're doing the CSM migration from 4.7 to 4.12 in January, and we imported a policy that advance sources gave to us. And in that policy, there was a bug, that basically… After sorting line number 15, or 17, or something in our store header in the firewall, which is our integration for all the stores that we have been growing so far, it said below that rule everything is… There's nothing there. So we just have 17 rules… So that was like a database restore that went wrong. Yes, so, the moral of the story is:
5; ;00:20:01,122 --> 00:25:00,070; ;a rollback feature, you know, and since we got hit so hard in January, we would like to see at least some level of rollback tested out before we go into production. Yeah,  that would be like… And when something happens, it's three of us trying to resolve that issue. If… Like you just said… If this is gonna be pushed back to 18 months, what can we do at 12 months that kind of like makes it a little better? Like an automatic policy-save. If that's all you can do in 12 months, that would be great. Before every deploy, have it force an automatic policy save.
- Right. It is not perfect, but if that is, like, all we can get in a 12-month period, I think it's like okay, that's something to get our stores were… Yeah, and then we do a couple of, you know, disaster scenarios, so we just say, “Okay, policy when, you know, completely blank, somebody put an any in a front of access policy or we lost the policy, or something like that, five different scenarios, and present it to the project team before they make any major decisions, you know. This is definitely a showstopper until and unless we find a workaround for it... a solid workaround. Look, it sounds pretty easy… This is a huge pain for us, we are constantly having to have the access control policy and the object database open to figure out what the rules do. So this goes along with the query, based on the query search destination ID, to see if it will allow it. This goes along the same lines of just... I don't know what these rules are until I look up every single object, because, yeah, we're getting away from IPs, and we want to become IP agnostic, but it never seemed as very IP-centric, and we need to understand what's in these rules to kind of digest them, you know? Do you guys use our object override? Yes, in our CSM world, we definitely use object override on almost every single firewall. That is when you are not looking at a specific device view, what is that? Yeah. That's a good question and that is something that we actually thought through. Understanding if you're looking at an ACP policy from the policy view versus the device itself… I don't know. I mean, I guess I would want something, maybe the contents. From the device or from the policy view, it should give me all of the levels. It should not give me the overrides, right, you shouldn't even… Maybe you have a star on there indicating that there are overrides for that specific object. Some indication that there are overrides, and then you could switch the view to more device-specific to get the actual value. A lot of our requests are gonna be object-based groups versus network objects here. If you hover over this network object right here, you can see the concepts. -Oh, no, you don't.
-Well, that's the group. - Are these the network objects?
-Yeah. - So if the single, you see the contents of this multiple, means you see multiple rules?
- Yes. - Okay. So some consistency between… I mean, I'd like to just hover over this. - If you're not going to give me the hover, give me a delay, right click and show the contents right on the screen without opening the object database. Right now, if you right click one of these, you get nothing, right? Yes, so cut, copy, edit. Can I ask you… [unintelligible] Okay, good. Yeah, that was one that at first probably ones that I think seemed like it was something we can squeeze into January, but… It's just really painful without… And I think Puri will address this in a way, but I still want the ability to just kind of lift up the objects to know what they are. Either right click, show, or hover giving it literal definitions. It would just be helpful for me. I know the engineer that coded this knows what every single rule is for. They know the project, they know the object-naming schemes, whereas me, I'm not associated with the google project. So I go in there, I'm like, “What the hell is all this?” So, as a scale… You know, obviously, in the last… The 4,500s came out, with 750 limits, and… So their architecture is gonna look like this. It is going to be 1,100 stores, give or take, two firewalls in HA per source. So it's 2,300 firewalls, but it seems like if there was a way to bring up 750 higher, knowing that… So right now, we have the run four FMC [unintelligible]… For... - 300 [unintelligible]. So, we need multiple, right, so knowing that it's HA, knowing that its Branch, knowing it's a single config, what can we do? We are kind of solving the automation… We're solving the Stuart Huxley, I think it's the thing?
6; ;00:25:00,403 --> 00:30:01,520; ;He's gonna write a custom automation script that basically synchronizes all [unintelligible]. So he said that… And this is what we are going to talk about later. …is that he withdrew FMC's automation script. Their team is going to write a script that basically synchronize policies. So that's what it comes to, if we have to have multiple FMCs. So we are going to have a master unit, would be my vision of this. You're mastering where everyone goes to make changes. And then we'd have slave units that get [unintelligible] automatically too. So the idea here would be, we have a 1,400 source, 1,300 source, or whatever we are going to have at the time. In HA, we have the exact ACP policy, exact file inspection ITS policy, pretty much a very consistent policy across the board, and then we make changes in the master, and it would replicate on the backend objects and policies. So you only have to make the change once, and it is not a single pin [unintelligible] but it is replicated on the backend. We would still want the ability within each FMC to have a local policy. To be able to use case for this, we're deploying this rule box at the source. With the rule box for the firewall rules that aren't there, it's only gonna get one store as a POB. So… Come say “hello” to you. [unintelligible] taking all their jobs… I've seen one of those at a tech show… [unintelligible] So, there's gonna be, like, RFID robots that go around in the middle of the night, and inventory, order, reader… Whatever they are. Well, yeah, if they're going to POB or POC the store, I want to be able to go into that. So, like, FMC that manages that specific box and add that. So I think that's where we're gonna run into issues with this whole replication process. I mean, [unintelligible]. Okay, okay. I don't know what helps. It's interesting. I kind of want to talk what deputies stopped at work, but I'd have to dig in… And I think we are trying to separate the scalability versus the usability. But I think at least giving you guys an idea of every little thing we need from startup… - Run those FMCs…
-HA? Yeah, we got 10 FMCs. Ten of them in a deployment where there's actually five active rule books. [unintelligible] So that is going to obviously complicate… [unintelligible] I don't know what this gentleman's solution's going to be, but preferential to the option to say, “Hey, we lost this pair for whatever reason, one need to master this one.” Or scale. Or do it all in one, Can it be that hard? All hardware to some giant box or [unintelligible]. Option to orchestrate FMCs, can we pull FMCs? Maybe it is one rack, make it five rack. One new server, no wonder it can't do anything. So I guess the limitation of work… Maybe if we worked with you, you'd understand, especially when we get to actual rule… If we get really close, is there anything we can do to go beyond 750, or because of this architecture, is that gonna be the absolute threshold? Average of this goes above 750. Well here's the other question: should we even attempt to put the 750,
- Yes if you have any customer that actually have 750. Because the last customer that we talk to had 4 or 5 variables. We haven't been able to find a large customer of FTD. I don't know if there's anyone using FMCs, to be honest. [unintelligible] Yeah I mean you haven't found like more than 100 right now, where we deployed more than 100 FTDs so synchronization might not be their biggest issue not even obvious. - But I did ask. - Yeah
- We have been knocking this right now. I have to get a lot of customer reference... - The products are new and self acceptable I mean we get it but it just got scary not knowing are we going to be our [unintelligible] customer? We definitely… Yeah, I think we did that with I1 when we had first I1 customer and Yeah I do wanna go back to that. Right, so you just mentioned that, I1, you were a beta I1 customer and it went through development and there was a close relation with the… And at the time, I was the largest I1 customer, what you say it was a successful project? I think it was a successful project and that's probably because you have partnered so well. Unfortunately the hand up he has never done so no one understands how works except person who found the project. We also don't have live action anymore.
7; ;00:30:01,839 --> 00:35:06,487; ;We have no way to tell what's happening at each store without logging into the store. So if you guys give us a solution that requires a third party management... I know I didn't like that. I didn't like it I thought what you guys should have offered some sort of service to manage the I1 solution. Not live the action piece. I don't like that part. I mean, it works but it's kind of a difficult situation because we don't have class action and market so... You don't want to worry you know it is getting them to the right times of those during the years of development phase. But but in the end I think I was very positive [unintelligible] and still is. We're looking to roll another place to that are way hotter. But even one of them with the savings that's just... Sometimes you catch things in the development cycle but you'd rather not wait, based upon those small thing that mark... - But we don't have the time to wait because we have to complete these firewalls. - Right
- That's why we pushing so hard for these features to be... not over a month.
- Right. Checkpoints don't start. Yeah, okay. So, we lost this … No, I'm still here. So, we're already past that... We're past this, you guys know what we need. Ability to view content from hovering over it, we're good with that. Our service group, features plus to add ports to a group, we don't have any. So, this is the rule that took me 23 minutes to create. So, yeah actually. [unintelligible] Damn right, we can! Yeah. I need to see if I can actually, I'm not quite sure. So, this becomes a problem when I have a rule, say any temp services. Now the example I gave him was …services, and we had a request for that. So, we have a rule that requires temp services. You basically have to go in there and create object groups for each service individually and then you have to put these into a service group object. You cannot put ports directly into a service group object. Now, on ASA you can, on CSM you can, on ASDM you can… I know…and here you have to create individual objects for each individual port. Now we have since created an API script to kind of, format some of that. But it still is something, it would just be you're giving me a request and I excel that, we copy and paste them out, we just want to paste them in the FMC. We don't want to have to go through and create 50 objects just to accommodate one firewall request in our firewall service group. So I can step these through that if that wasn't clear enough. Go to Objects, I know in AC Policy, you can't make groups, which is a problem. - Yes.
- Now, in Objects page, when you're editing a group, you can create an object from that group. So, this object right here, we got this, now, say I want to add 20 IP. Yes. Like one at a time? One at a time. Now, you can do if your ranges are contiguous like this, you can do a dash, you know 1.10 and you can do the contiguous range, that's fine. But I can't take an exclusive IP address or network and piece them in here easily. From this view itself, what were you saying I could probably do? You can create network options. Actually this one is not as useful because [unintelligible], if you go to Service or Port. Oh, out of here? Okay. Yeah. And this is what we've had to do and again the same concern here is that you can't see… Oh no, you can in this one. Okay. So now you add a port. Which is this? So now, from here, there's that green icon next to port group. Yep. But this is what you did essentially? Yep. Yep! Every single port I would just name it like TCP-389 and the Port-389, protocol TTP, okay Save and then it saves this side and then you have to drag it back over.
- Yeah… So, everything we do isn't we don't really use network objects very much. Everything we do is object groups, so it's just very easy to dump a bunch of networks into a group or a bunch of ports into a service group. It just makes it very difficult so, if I wanted to add a group, here's my option. There's no option to add ports, they have to be objects, which means I have to then, as a pre-req, go in here and add all my individual object groups and then, take them into over… If we're going to add multiple ports at the same time, do you open up the Add Port icon?
- This?
8; ;00:35:08,411 --> 00:40:11,612; ;So it would be ok if they don't have to [unintelligible]? If they had the same protocol… Did you place them like 20 or 30…? - You select the AP and then there's a text field where you could just copy everything and everything is… - That's exactly what we want,
- yes. And then, I don't know if we have line items for this to go in a little further. I've got a Zabbix here, I need to clean them up. I need to know what's used, what's not used. How do I do that? There's no way. You can't say, ‘Hey, tell me where the' – Yeah, you tracked it, ‘Tell me where this object is used. Is it on any policy? If a down policy, are those policies assigned to devices? Basically, are these used or not?' And there's no way to tell that or say like, ‘Where is this used?' - And we currently use that in CSM for all your teams?
- Oh yeah, - yes, we…
- And, it is…is it per item or even within each one of them? So, what I would like to see here is another column, - that says usage.
- Used Or something like that that I can then click something on, like a checkbox that says that it's used and then once you open that, it'll tell you which policies it has used up. Maybe a filter… Take a policy, pick up a filter. Yes, yes. The checkpoint also had to clear user authentication. Yes, yes, the checkpoint had a similar allocation as a and maybe that's not a big issue for other people but some vendors, we like to say, ‘Okay, we'll give you this group of ports. So they might be your support ports to your specific servers. So we'll call their destination servers, like Cisco – host, that'll be all the hosts they have access to and then we night have Cisco - VPN - services, every single service we're allowing Cisco to use to their host over the VPN. It'll just be easier to dump those into group objects. Yeah, true. You audit objects as well? Yes! Because we brand those innovations that the project database has and every time you import a device, if you don't have an object-override enabled for the device underscore 1. The object usage would help that as well… that if the object is not used at all, it's easier for you to… Yeah…we can just sort in CSM we can just sort this column by ‘Used' or ‘Not Used' and then just highlight them all. Sure, yeah. Now, how many object did you get up to before you hit the data limit? Within CSM? About 6,000 – 7,000, it wasn't a lot. I mean it was a decent amount to get us our production environment only needs about 900 to 1,000 objects, so most of them were duplicates from imports we had done and the merging that we had done. And then here, it's like, I can't tell if these are used or not or… The CDO has that capability though. [unintelligible] Maybe if you start… You mean CDR? Yeah, everybody's saying CDO… we looked at it last year, and it was not usable but now it seems like… It still needs a lot of features to be included but it's getting there… So, it just manages the policies, right, it doesn't actually… Right now, yes. I mean it manages devices just at a very high level. But, not any device configurations - like interfaces or routing or…
- XOS Editor? Yeah… It doesn't do any of that. It doesn't? Okay. GSA Automation model Remember when Davidson first without discussing CDO, remember? That enterprise started [unintelligible] DISA Enterprise Services? He sent the files… What are you talking about? This was the file… I legit never even heard of DSM before I came here. No one has. And anyone who's heard of it, the CDO or CAC, they're just getting annoyed at me because I'm the only one constantly mentioning CSM. Like how does no one know, there aren't like I don't know... A lot of people I guess don't have a footprint. There are people there with hundreds of ASAs that manage them all with ASDM. How do you ensure your security posture is consistent across a 100 ASDM. - They don't, they don't ensure that.
- No, you don't. There's like SDOs and so many people managing it… - Server is down I guess.
- Yeah, where is it? - Click that folder.
- Oh, allocation? What was going on with that? Switching back? No, I'm just trying to get the app analysis… So we're past this…
9; ;00:40:12,588 --> 00:45:07,313; ;Service group feature request to add ports in a group, instead of having to create groups and put them into group objects… [unintelligible] Simplified workflow for object management. Ability to create a group network object, a network object, or a group service object from within our rule. There is the ability to create a service object, but not a group service object, or a service group, I don't know why it says group service object. Same goes for network objects, you cannot create an object with multiple hosts or networks from within our rule. But, I don't think you can get more specific than that, but I can… That's pretty straightforward. Okay, I can show you that, but I think it's pretty clear in there that the consistency of creating a network object versus a group object. If I've got 10 subnets I want to call network security monitoring hosts or networks or something like that, I just want to create a group for that. I don't want to create individual groups and then add it to the group object. I mean, if you could do it with CLI, why won't it be supported in[unintelligible]? That one I think is pretty self-explanatory. We've done some of the analysis. We transition [unintelligible] usability. Yeah and [unintelligible] we transitioned some of our usability and this is up to debate whether they're usability or management, and maybe it's me not getting some of it right. But now like we are in some of the priority 2, and, Mark, a couple of these in here are yours. I think priority 1 and 2. - That's three.
- Feel free to state your case. These are all priority 2, again the categories might be valid…I'm not going to go deep in this, this isn't useful to anything this is an enhancement we need TACACS for FPT and FMC. Right now it's local only, that's a problem. Especially when FXOS uses PACs. I'm going to expand that a little bit, too. The ability to pull out of radius support with your local admin fallback If I were… I want to be able to have that local admin user - on if it's hard-coded to it.
- Yep. And right now the work form I got from your support organization was... well, just make your radius server unavailable for this server. Great, so now they're going to take the whole damn chassis  off the network, or I've got to blow radius out of the water. I'm not going to do either of those. You guys have radius servers? You have your own radius servers? No, we hook into the [unintelligible]. Oh, ok ok. [unintelligible] with my backend? - Does it mean it's part of Tech X? - We don't use Tech X honestly. [unintelligible] I don't think you need to go in depth there. I think what he's saying I would expect us to be advised that there is local fallback, that's how all the Cisco stuff works. [unintelligible] None of the rest of the Cisco stuff works this way. Bul**** [unintelligible] [unintelligible] [unintelligible] And it's just... there was no fallback. As soon as I enabled that radius application, admin completely s*** the bed because well... There's no admin user defined in radius. We have to take radius down or sever radius connection like implying that radius is down and then it should fall back to the local. You'll never be able to log into a local comp and a radius comp at the same time unless you did some interesting tweaking. I know that you guys are from the FX/OS team or so, but there was [unintelligible] a certificate both were I think fixed in the new FS/OS...  In 6201. I'm going to have to go back and look, because I'm going to fall up on both [unintelligible] request that were talking to me, the engineer between that and certificates. Let me just find out what the status is… Because we are sitting on as far as of XLS right now we are sitting on 211 [unintelligible]. I'll take the action and figure out where they are cause there's both enhancement requests. There's something [unintelligible] in February, Greg, let's find out about that. - It probably is a bust. - I'll figure it out. I'll find out where those two enhancements… The [unintelligible] sure they work, but we have to rotate the passwords constantly. Every time we lose[unintelligible], every six months we have to rotate those passwords, there's no automated way to rotate these passwords. So yeah. I know in the past other people have written scripts to do exactly that [unintelligible] that is an option.
10; ;00:45:08,546 --> 00:50:06,171; ;[unintelligible] to be managed by FMC entirely. - That that….
- Entirely stand-alone Why is the [unintelligible] that covers the you know… the FMC entirely. Yeah. So there are deployments which got 16 [unintelligible] FTD mode, but I mean, making epic OS chassis consistent configuration is very difficult for us. So we created a CLI script that basically goes in each scope and changes each setting but you can't do everything you need to do in an scope command. So we kind of have a script that helps us maintain consistency but it doesn't work as good as we wanted to. We'd rather... like the point of our hearts is get away from FXOS or have FXOS managed from policy inspected with an FMC. That should be [unintelligible] for nothing instead of rolling the next feature but I think that, I mean, it's a no brainer that FMC can manage FX OS. [unintelligible] So the next one device policy: ability to add group object. I don't know if this is a duplicate from row eleven or if this is possibly something separate but it looks like this one calls out service objects and it also calls out network objects as an issue with an ACP policy. This to me sounds like a duplicate. This device policy [unintelligible] I wasn't sure. [unintelligible] Oh no, ok I know what this is then. Yes, so under platform, or under the device view,  so say the specific the specific cluster. Say one that edit platform settings in the specific cluster. So do we wanna, is there any way you can add note of this so we don't have this question on this row, just clarifying what the row action means. But if you go into based by platform settings, what we wanna do for some of these HTTP: we have a very specific range of hosts that should be allowed to access this firewall from HTTP or FDM, or whatever, or FMC, no, no FMC to HTTP, but we want to put an access list on these boxes for HTTP similar to what we have for ASAs. When you click in, all you can do is add individual IP's or networks. I wanna add a network group. These are individual inner network objects, they don't support group objects. So like we have a group object that contains all of our network support users… There is no group option here just individuals. So I have basically split up our objects that contains 12 networks into their own individual networks. And every time I add a network to that, it's not inherited like if I had a group there, and added a network to the group, it just would be inherited, just be there. I would have to manually log on and manually network. So Derek for that one. Yeah, I got it, line thirteen. - Yeah.
- I highlighted the specific device setting - [unintelligible] from setting right?
- Yeah. And that HTTP instance I mean there is still ICP I think I have another line item for this one. But it's a similar thing where you can only add networks and not a group. So say admins can ping the interface or same thing for SSH. [unintelligible] All network objects, can create network objects from here but you cannot create groups. Do you guys getting everything under… typing rather quick we are capturing everything [unintelligible] From the UI it might be... Yeah, but lot of backend.. - [unintelligible]
- I'm not sure why [unintelligible] It just helps this to be a little more dynamic like... We have a lot of building moves we have a lot of consultants so we add on, we repetitiously update our support groups and manually going into all these based policies it's a bit pain. So, FMC to FMC migration discovery of configuration on FTD devices, now I don't want to put this into [unintelligible] perhaps you can clarify. So we are migrating from an FMC instance to an FMC instance, is that what it's supposed to mean? And FTD devices don't maintain the config, you can't discover an FTD device, you have to push the FTD device.
11; ;00:50:06,171 --> 00:55:01,835; ;[unintelligible] you put that thing right in? I've been seen discovery… I think… I think I did it. [unintelligible] Have you really have an understanding, if I wanna move a device from one manager to another manager? Oh yeah, we ‘ve had that problem, OK. So that, we have a lab environment where we've got a [unintelligible] and we wanted to change this into a firewall that was behind the SEM into a production store and we wanted to put it into our production FMC. So as we, as we did that we configured the manager command, I don't remember what happened, but we've never process used that. Yeah, maybe it's the stream on processes. Right? As we start managing multiple… what is our process, is there a way we can clean up that hole? Without taking an outage. I guess pull a device out of one FMC put into another. Yeah, we didn't get like a… streamline answer on that. Part we had FTD devices in our lab FMC and so, deleting the device from the FMC We just pull them in [unintelligible] and then remove the manager command from the FMC - and discovering the product.
- Yeah. And while you did that, I think... That [unintelligible] configurations [unintelligible] were discovered - and we didn't have issues there.
- [unintelligible] Not the whole configurations but there were some lingering…. I think that particular manager command that was still lingering like [unintelligible] show two managers. - Yeah we kinda…
- We aligned and deleted the managers, and I guess the actual process was to never seal live leak t manager, it was just configuring the new manager in FMC would delete the old manager. We, we created a [unintelligible] box when we did that… so we changed the IP address [unintelligible]... we changed the IP address then it was… how do we bring it back right? It was… that would happen, at that point, there was a device who was trying to contact the manager but the manager's IP had changed. [unintelligible] Yeah, because in the lab we had a different IP address we put the vCard environment which had a different IP address, different FMC, and then, we didn't have issues there. And then after that, we pulled that lab from the [unintelligible] and to be a part of the production store. And there, it would have the IP address again. I think we did that FMC. I don't think we did that FMC [unintelligible] - So complicated.
- IP address only and we do know the actual process... ...so I think there were multiple address I mean... - someone said “It's OK” maybe half them [unintelligible].
- The most CFD was found in one case [unintelligible] Oh my goodness! So if you do any discovery on the FTD it's not going to be there right? The policy is going to be pushed only [unintelligible] discovers. I could not unplug the firewall right now and somehow discover it from a new FMC environment. It's not going to be there, there's no plan for that, I don't think we need that. So discovery configurations on FMC devices, I don't know if we're going to ever need that or there is a need for that. As long as we have our FMC after HA we'll always have our policy to push to the device. Probably not, but [unintelligible] start talking about this. [unintelligible] what would happen.
Probably not, but [unintelligible] start talking about this. [unintelligible] what would happen. Yeah obviously there is definitely a big asset for discovery configuration [unintelligible], because [unintelligible] that's what people want, - or what we want...
- Really? Yeah. I could see that. Why? - Why? Because [unintelligible] FMC NHA you have daily backups for your FMC. - An argument is we haven't done it yet.
- Yeah. Which is good, but it's still be prioritized. It's gonna be work. - [unintelligible] FDD right?
- No. But this is one that FDD configuration to be discovered in a new FMC [unintelligible]. Shouldn't it be as simple as configure manager, a new manager IP? Boom and it's discoverable? Oh no, no, it doesn't work like that.... you have to push its policy that you have assigned to the FMC, you can't discover. [unintelligible] the device in FMC and the same in policy. - Yeah Yeah
- [unintelligible] [unintelligible] We have waited there from 15 to 20 minutes. [unintelligible] So if we end up have to flip us store over five FMC's, for some reason issue FMC returns, [unintelligible] maybe move some storage around, maybe there are some resource constraints, for some sort [unintelligible] To move an FMC or FTD to a different FMC. That should be a [unintelligible] to that. Defined. That would be part of our…. failover cases synchronizing policy as well as moving that store of firewalls - from one FMC to another FMC.
- Yeah.
12; ;00:55:01,873 --> 01:00:00,835; ;Because, I think when we start deploying into the store then we have, I don't know, 300, 350 stores maximum, and then, couple of troubles on how to move it to another FMC, something like that. That's what we should do. - [unintelligible] last one.
- No, I'm not. - Yeah.
- This is, this is near the mark here, so… as you see 217 right? So dual flow is flipped. Exactly. I mean potentially viewed. - [unintelligible] policy changes [unintelligible].
- Yeah. Yes, so say we have changes to block something and it's scheduled with an application team to test a certain time, and they need the console to make smart changes, we don't want them to have to push our stuff in between time. - [unintelligible] deployment.
- Yep. You guys [unintelligible] showing sounds like - you've already trying something like that.
- Yep. - Okay.
- You know that's actively being developed or? Okay. I do not know. It's interesting because I think problems with trying to do that because as your HTTP policy directly correlates to the IDS policy, any DHCP rule will have IDS policies on it. So if you got new rules you bet it, and you want to deploy those and they're able for IDS policy… Maybe that's why they are not there today. - It would be like a quick deployment.
- Yep. Where you would have [unintelligible] policy… - ...but still. Yeah?
- Yeah. I think 15 would've touched on that right? I... we obviously know it'll be nice for this to be automated, specially [unintelligible]. We had a little bit of fun migrating CSM to FMC. I found out that, you know, it's all possible by how we did it was we went into CSM and merely copied the CSM access control table into an Excel file, discovered device by the script to save objects and then manually created that by staring and comparing all the way down. [unintelligible] I did it on a plane flying back to California. So anyway, I think the point is that it seems that there should be a process. Yeah [unintelligible] thousands of, the migration tool that's out there it's not CSM migration tool, it's just NSA migration tool limited to fifty thousand. Limited to fifty thousand [unintelligible]? Oh now, so when we did our first migration it was fifty thousand [unintelligible] 67 dollars and we had to break that up into two separates. We had to break it down into two separates. I even looked at it recently but it's definitely in the hundred thousands. Okay. Way more than it was. So, a way to get our stuff out of CSM, a way to convert, I think after, after this project or after whatever, we still gonna have hundreds of ASA's out there that we'd like to convert. And all [unintelligible] series, they might not have the SSD, I don't know, I guess at least understanding what is the plan for people that is stuck with [unintelligible] deployments ASA using CSM, how to get those over. Even policies out from CSM. - Two hundred thousand.
- Two hundred thousand [unintelligible]. [unintelligible] Oh, wow, okay, PGA and [unintelligible] for a second. So the next line item is pretty important, this is his [unintelligible] few times, so a list of devices in pending changes, now that's there, we know that's there. You pick and deploy, you see there are devices pending changes, you see that there are specific policy changes, not the individual policy name, but we like NCP change and I guess I can share that right now. If were to click deploy, you can see here's our boxes pending delta - or that are dirty, here's what's changing.
- Yep. So, that's fine. I like that, but now I wanna know what's changing. What exactly on the access control is changing. Is somebody putting an [unintelligible] there? Is somebody blocking something? Is somebody permitting a… [unintelligible] aggressive role?
13; ;01:00:00,905 --> 01:05:02,340; ;Is there a…with FTP or telnet or some ansible protocol that we don't allow on our network? What's happening? We don't know. Very good question. Now, after it deploys, there is a way, um… Not here. Under… -“Tasks”.
-Yeah, “Show History”. No, “Tasks”.
I'm sorry, it's… I clicked it, it popped up over here. Not under “Tasks”, it's under “Show History” of “Deployments”. So, you click “Show History” here, and it gives you 20 histories. 20 is what we'll max out in one day. We need this to be… We need more. I don't know. Two weeks' work to look back, at least. Instead of a hard-set number, maybe a hard-set date of lookback data. This is a resolution issue, which I think is another line item. But if you look here, you can see... if you click on specifics point, it normally… I don't know what it is. My laptop has a weird resolution. But normally, you'd click this and then you'd click “Transcript”. And this is the actually delta pilot box. I want to see this before I deploy the box. And I wanna see it in a graphical format. So before you deploy, know what you're deploying. But don't be surprised. And I guess to go even further on that, tell me who did it. Tell me what login, user ID made each line item on this transcript. Which one of the associates? You know, this goes back to the workflow piece. And maybe we do need a workflow. Like, somebody is able to submit changes. Another team is forced to approve those changes. Another team has to deploy the changes. A scenario like that, where there is peer-review. But right now, there's nothing to peer-review until after it deploys. But after it deploys, the issue is already present. So, I guess that's our rollback, right? Sorry. Just the last bit. Also, ability to see who deployed it, or… Yes, yes. So… I mean, it's nice to know who made the deployment. If it's off-hours and somebody does a manual scheduled deployment, I want to know who did that and broke the protocol. But at the same time, whatever's deploying, I want it to aggregate all of the changes by user ID. Give me an idea of who made each change. If there is one of our L2 guys to put in any-any and someone else try to have a conversation with them about the way our rules work something like that, we need to be able to track that down. We need to be able to audit who did something. That is coming… Who did something is coming. Uh 62, 622. Yep. So it's gonna be an Auto Log so I'll show you where deployments happen. So if you go to “System”. Yeah. So, are you going to show me the Auto Log? And you're familiar with gaps the Auto Log has. -Yeah.
-Okay.
And you're familiar with gaps the Auto Log has. -Yeah.
-Okay. And I wanna hear the gaps. I will. There. System Monitor. So, system monitoring auto, manual. So inside here whenever there's a policy change. Gap's not on. There's essentially going to be an icon next to subsystem that will bring up the diff of what happened, so you can see the change and what change they made. Yeah. So, like, when we… We made this change to an ex-control policy… [unintelligible] I don't know what page view is, I don't know… That just means that you need the page. Right now… Yeah, the person… So, I guess…out here, ‘cause there's no way to see what I did. Exactly. Yeah, but… But there are some, like… If you go to “System Integration”, and you configure each [unintelligible]… to, like, select 11 queues and even if blah blah, blah… And you do the edit source on that system audit. Then it will show you the diff of, like… Okay, before, you know, in History, you're only sending the connection events. Now somebody changes it, you, you know… Connection events and, like, all the events. So, there are, like… Only specific feature in FMC, if you change it, they will show the diff. - Just that AC policy.
-Yes. Okay. So that'll be there. But again, it doesn't fully solve the other one. It just... …allows us a little bit to know who made the change. -So that's in 2-2?
-2-2. Yeah. This is after it is…[unintelligible] So, we want to know what happened in the first place, what happened after it deployed it. I mention this 15 plus days [unintelligible] would be great, I was working directly… Yeah, 20 days. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So, 20…
14; ;01:05:02,425 --> 01:10:03,968; ;So right now, it shows 20 deploys, that's it. Doesn't matter if they're today or last week whatever It's your 20…you get. Troubleshooting initial attack where I can't put in this firewall because we're getting some sort of bug, and we need to know when was the last deployment. Well, I'm looking in here, and sure enough, somebody tried deploying it, like, 10 times in a row. That ate up my 20 last connec… Last deploys, so I couldn't see when it last deployed. -Still can't deploy that box.
-Which one? [unintelligible] ... Working for months, and months, and months, and now it's stopped... When we hit… We saw… all in the book. Yeah, it doesn't match the log. Oh, so you guys called Tech? [unintelligible] We're not sure… So we already know it's coming. Destination FTPs. So, this was an interesting portion of our POV, Cisco and Checkpoint. Little score for Cisco and their own proprietary. But we know what's coming, so… -One day.-
Yep. One day soon. So this an issue as well. Especially with my laptop, which is probably the most common resolution out there, 1024x768. You can only view four or five rules at a time. How much did you zoom in? Because when we zoom in 50%, we could see 16 bits. -What's that?
-Zoom in. How much did you zoom out? Oh. Yeah, so I'm not… I'm sharing right now. So, if I go into one of our ACP policies… Now, what I would want to see here is more of an infinite scroll. Why… What's the page view? Why? It just complicates things, and you get confused as to where are the policies because of the way we have these folders. -Well, this folder is 1 through 318.
-Yep. So now I'm still on page… Oh, no. Okay. So it got rid of all the pages there. But we have other folders within here where it kind of overlaps in-between pages, and causes… It just makes it super-confusing to actually view what's going on. And right now… So, this is the default resolution. Right now, I'm… So this will be a regular old 100% zoom. I can see 5 rules of time. Did you… What I end up doing is zooming in, or zooming out to about 80%, and then I can see nine rules at a time. But still, we want… It's fine if it's the resolution on the laptop. On my normal monitor, I can see, what? Ten rules at a time. But give me an infinite scroll, don't add the pages, I guess will be my ask for you guys. But, yeah. Because that way, I can see all… Because I can't see all of my folders or sections on one page, unless I go through every single page, un-expand all of them, then I can see all my sections. That's just a lot of dead space on the top even though, too. See, because the view of this could use… A question. Typically, what is the rules… Number of rules? -Uh, typically?
-Yeah. -Well…
-Policies… ACEs? Or, like, CSM-type rules? Or decrypt together would be better? It depends. So, on a Firewall Pair, like I said, we're layered. Three layers, four. We don't really do Identity yet. We wanna do trust-sec. We're working on a matrix of something, but I think InfoSec, or the engineer that we have assigned to our project is very IT-centric, and microflow-centric, so he wants us to define every single flow and create SGTs for every single mini-application, and destination SGTs for all the destinations, and it's just getting very, very, very complex. We were hoping to have a policy that was very, very simple using SGTs, but I don't know if Security or InfoSec is willing to relax more and give us that flexibility to make our policy five rules instead of 700. This specific firewall, which is dedicated to Google Cloud, has 319 rules, any-any at the bottom. The any-any it hit 90% of the time, nobody requests access because the any-any is there. We have to rip that any-any out. This rule base is going to triple once we rip that any-any out. So, on average, maybe five to seven are rules. But we don't want to be there. We want to… We want to simplify our rule base. We just don't know how to get there. I don't know. We're trying to partner with InfoSec and build that framework, but I guess they don't have a drive to do that. We do, because we manage the policy sets. They just approve the firewall across, so what does it matter to them?
15; ;01:10:07,929 --> 01:15:00,243; ;So, the next one… Combine rules. So, if we have overlapping rules… I don't know if I really want this anymore. Wanted to understand this one. Make it a bit clear, like, what is the used case here? I can, now that, specially in targeting next-gen and noticing that each one of those is kind of specific threats, and maybe that… So thinking about the way that someone is gonna do it, if you have two rules… So, say, the source is 10, the next source, 172.26, or 172.60. Two separate rules going to the same destination over the same protocol, those end up being two separate ACEs on the firewall, but what CSM would do, would basically combine them all, get all of the matching ones, and then put them all in one rule. So, from the GUI's perspective, you have one rule, all in one view. Would it clean up our rule list? Yes, it would kind of… It would bring our rule number count down because it would combine the rules. We would just have to maintain separate descriptions, or at least a thorough description of all of the flows in-between. I don't know. What were we talking about, guys? - Um, combining the rules. So…
- I think [unintelligible] -  You can write…
- if you want to separate the rules, because if you want to add additional codes - or something, we have to again break the... For this combination we won't have to break that flow, and, like, add additional codes or something like that. - I don't know.
- And if we have sections… If we have rules, subsections, specific applications or - order, or…
- I mean, I think it depends on use cases and what kind of rules we're trying to combine. I mean, if the source is the only thing different, and the destination and services are the same, then why have two different rules? It's a [unintelligible] Maybe something like a warning, or something like when you add a rule, - that actually gives right… there's an...
- overshadowing rule… [unintelligible] I think he's looking for something automatic, where it automatically adds those rules, but I think it is more of an enhancement than… I think it's a debatable enhancement, just for the fact that if you have individual sections that is just an abbreviation, and you want to combine rules, now you've got these two rules that were under independent application sections. Where are they gonna go? Into an application section? It doesn't make sense for second portion of that rule. So, having a physical separation of the rules makes it easier to interpret what each rule's for. If there's specific sources that we would group, we manually do it, I guess. I don't know. Basically, I don't think this needs to be a priority too I don't know. I don't even like [unintelligible] it anymore. I think especially now knowing the order of operations, and understanding the order of operations for snore too. Really and as we move away from IT-based rules and methodology, and choose what's important. Right, as you move to SUT or thread or risk, it would be nice if the tool gave some better feedback on the policy, right? - I think...
- I think a lot of falls under that category of auditing the policy... Along with just saying that they are overshadowing, it would say, “Do you want to combine?” That's when you take a decision whether you want to put it together, yeah. If you say, “Combine,” then it merges into one. In TSA there was limitations on the number of, like, what piece that it could help. I don't know if the same applies for the… But even combined doesn't [unintelligible] modifications. But we don't know how they push the rules. - Oh, sure.
- So… Yeah, we hit “Implement” all of the time on the ASAs. Yes it is. And again, it's our micro… You can't do subnet-to-subnet, even if it's PCI-PCI, we have to do host-to-host on a lot of stuff, just because, you know… you got... - I mean...
- You gotta figure out something. - for instance like that...
- Its not available - That rule for...there is
- Yeah there is, I just added I mean, if there is a rule 5 here, and then rule 319 is one of those that could be combined with rule 5… I mean, that whole…I mean, for that rule, it doesn't have to go through all those rules to get to 3... - 319
- I see what you're saying, yeah. - It might make things more efficient.
- That's why... it makes the firewall more efficient by grouping. Of course there's a pre-filter policy which you can apply if… To offload some of the… So, there's… I think there's value in it. And it just looks neat. I mean, that's more of it. I mean, it's not like… - Automatically group based on similar source
- When... Or consistent destination services. I mean, Security Group Tag or the trusted model is based on the grouping of the objects. That's what it basically is. You define, “Oh, your desktops are these, your users are these, your servers are these, your PCI and all of this…”
16; ;01:15:00,307 --> 01:20:04,591; ;If we start doing it, won't it impact the order in which the rules are written in? Is it okay, or is a basic logic which we could use, or is it something at risk if we start doing that? I think of the order of rules is something we have to consider with that. Especially if we have… Key counts, then we just have [unintelligible] . What are the most used rules, you don't want that rules to be on the bottom of the list, you want that rule to be on the top of… The axis-one rule policy, right? You don't want it to… so, it just depends how frequently that rule is used. [unintelligible] Just take your time, [unintelligible] We are gonna adjust priority, and then... Yeah, put “3” over there. - Yeah, I think that's the easiest thing…
- Not really a “2”. If others are “2”, then that's a “3”. Definitely. And I think it's still debatable as to whether or not… I kind of see the value in it, but then again, I see it could cause issues. Say somewhere we didn't have the same scenarios of the… up the evaporation on the FTP too. Next one's easy. Right click an ACP rule for events. So, I wanna know… Show me all the traffic that's ever hit this rule. Simple as that. But that would imply that we have the events stored and we have some sort of loopback data. Unless that can open up a portal in the QRadar, or give you a string… The page to the Q radar, search query or a splunk string, I don't know. There's got to be a way to correlate it easily with the event. Within our QRadar logs right now, I don't know if we actually see the exact ACP policy or the rule number related to it. - If we do… It's not parsed, I know that.
- It does. It's in the system. If... it does. There's definitely an SSR message. Which rule, which policy. - you talking about
- I know it's in the [unintelligible]. I don't know if it's in QRadar events. So, if it's just taking everything it has in the connection and sending it off using the QRadar, then it should be there. - Okay.
- Or, like, in the payload. It's in the payload. It's in the… Yeah. So, you just click into… Well, you wanna be able to search by that, though, right? Yeah, yeah. Give me an example, I'll see if I can pull it out. Okay. I think… I mean, we have the ability to add the payload as a column, and the payload is searchable. Yeah, but that's very expensive to search by. you... Like, resource-wise? Yes. If we can actually pull it out, I can make it indexable. And then you can actually search by ID. Okay. Oh, if you have cases like that, bring it to my attention, and I can see about pulling something out. Okay. Um, in most cases we've used the connection event, but as we add more firewalls, the connection events are becoming less useful. This is my issue. 1024x768. I don't know why your resolution is better than mine. [unintelligible] understood…yeah. I mean, I… I guess taking off of this piece, ignore that, and the ability to just kind of scroll through the entire thing, instead of paging through. So, what I was talking to them earlier was… So we have that auditing query feature, right? And the report generation from that is from a policy. If we can query that certain rule… And then it will create another… It will query and then create another box with a whole set of rules, giving us, “Okay, this flow keeps these rules. And any rule that you need services an application, this particular rule” So on and so forth, then that would help the most [unintelligible] I mean, what they were saying was, having the whole set of access control policy in that single line will only make the FMC probably slower because it's going back, querying all the… Okay. So, we have this next-gen firewall. The reason we have 3 of these lines is because we're doing things in a legacy-generation way. We're doing everything IT-based, /32 to /32. If there's a way you guys can help us sell something else to our InfoSec team, or if there's a way we can get it down. So we have less than 48 rules, so I can see it all in one page. I mean, I think that's great, but we don't have that [unintelligible], and we have a process. We have… We don't know how to get to next-gen with our current security processes. I mean, [unintelligible]. It's a journey. It's a lack of understanding on their behalf, it's a lack of understanding on our behalf, it's… What are other customers doing? I mean, we've asked for rule-based examples from other customers that are using application-centric business, risk applications, and more of the next-gen stuff, where they might have a firewall with 10 rules on it. But everyone we've looked at, felt they all are IP-based and…
17; ;01:20:05,585 --> 01:25:06,305; ;Or they've had to hide most of their policy work where we can't what it was before getting it to them. The understanding how we can get there, having some sort of… If we're using all Cisco technologies and trust sectors there has some sort of migrational systems and maybe it's an advanced or an advisory service we get, just trying to get help us in negotiate using some of these next-gen features. Because we have to be able to interpret and understand exactly how they work. And I think that the gap here is our InfoSec team doesn't understand it, because we can't convey them because I don't think we a 100% know in a lot of cases. Sure. Some typical services… [unintelligible] But this policy on this firewall that I've been trying those 316 rules, it's just unmanageable. There's absolutely no way you can load this policy and try to get a whole listed view of what it does. They're too long, there's too many pages… 10,000 rules. It's much, much worse. Do you have trust words with 10,000 rules but then they are ASCII? Why are they even using FTD? Just to get a couple of application rules in there? You don't see a lot of people just inherently using just business risk or just business critical, or… Okay. So, it's always a combination. There you are. Just one of the reasons. There's software, right? ASA software download… Slowly, it will fade away, right? I think there's a workaround for that. Operating 9.8. Yes, that's what they are saying. So, 9.7 is just gone? It's not ASA platform. Well, I mean, like… I'm saying, like, ASA is slowly fading out. It's implying that… The whole FTD… So, that's fine, if it's all is synchronization, I don't think we need to go there. You guys know… So, this one's good. In a lot of cases, we don't have the same licensing across the board. So, I want to create a new policy that contains all of the rules. I want to be able to copy that policy and paste it. And then I want to disable whatever features, in that policy that don't match my licensing. We just walk through a demo, maybe… [unintelligible] Copy. Copy. You can see you can copy the tip off, or some chipboard… Give me the ability to copy it into itself. In a few scenarios here, not… Okay, so, we have a couple of different scenarios that I want to point out here. I want to be able to highlight all this and say, ‘Okay, application team, here is your application,” Control+C, open up Excel, Control+V. Can't. If there is an export button, probably… Um… Have you seen the export? Well, no. An export… Okay. So, there is an export. But that export's not the one. Okay. If there was an export… Would that be sufficient? Yes. I mean, the ability to just copy and paste would be awesome, too. But then, once you export, then you make certain changes or remove certain things. You will also need the ability to import it back in some manner. Right? Otherwise, what… What's the point? Because of the auditings. Auditing, I understand, but if you had to copy with stripping out certain… certain... If you don't have license on that device, right? So, you might want to have the ability to import as well, in some cases. So, I want to be able to dump the rule base for somebody in a legible format. That's not a 175 PDF pages with one rule per PDF. So, the way you guys display that today isn't feasible unless you've only got four or five rules. So, what we end up getting is too many pages. So, what I want to do is copy and paste this in Excel… Something…Just to give them something. Export to Excel. CSP, that would be fine as well. Um, a PDF that's more of a view like this, where it's actually legible instead of single pages per rule, that'd be great, too. Just something that'll be a little report on what rules are there, to be able to give to the teams [unintelligible]. Is it okay if it's just object needs? [unintelligible] That's fine. I mean, we have the same problem with CSM. We always end up doing a key of a dump, or object contents, and it's kind of a pain to do that. I mean, actually go to the rules, but I understand it's probably not gonna be something easy. Something like copy and paste out of here would… I would think would be easier. Now, taking this one step further, we want to be able to copy this out into Excel. Now, I also want to say, you know what, all of my policies, if I start fresh, I am probably going to start with these first few rules, eventually, these will hopefully be blocks instead of monitor.
18; ;01:25:06,705 --> 01:30:01,025; ;But I want to… I want to copy these. I want to paste them in… I want to paste them into a new ACP policy, or an existing ACP policy. Why not use an [unintelligible] for that instead, where you just have a base policy with those four rules? And then all other ones, which you said [unintelligible]. These four rules require specific licensing. Not just these specific rules, any specific rules. It could be fine, get… to default all of these. Whatever you choose. Whatever your team needs. You choose which base policy… Right. - Can't have multiple…
- Okay. I feel we should understand a little bit more about the inheritance piece of it. It's pretty quick. We can sort it out right, 2 seconds. When we have policy inheritance… Well, actually creating… So, I'll show you. This is what we have now. We have got a Store-Global-policy, which is basically protocols that we… And services that we say, “Hey, let's go with this everywhere internal,” and then we have got our individual Store-On-… policy that's actually, like, specific to the store. Like, specific to…  like you said before, if you just copy those four rules into some base policy that is… You cannot copy, so you have to… - You have to make…
- Yeah, yeah, make a full…right, four rules and… And all the policies  that you need with the rules as the base policy. Then you'll automatically get those four rules. If you have to make a change to those four rules, then you can do it in one place, instead of everywhere… Like, X number of policies you copy… I'm just trying to think, like… When they get the inheritance piece, how will the inheritance solve our problem? Are you guys following? You are? More like these guys.  You guys following? Show but one rule. Okay, so we get this scenario recently where we have this facility… Nothing, turned off. It might have powered down, the TV. Oh, the power. Oh, yeah, maybe… When you did this, I think it went off. Turned off. So, we have a scenario where we deployed a firewall pair, which is going to be for our secondary ECX Cloud Exchange that has to contain the exact same policy. Well, here is our policy right here… It's this one. It's CH2 Access Control. I couldn't assign this to the box, because for some reason, we didn't have the licensing right, and we needed the firewall off that day. So I copied and pasted this, and then I was hoping I can go - and disable the DNS license…
- I got you. After you copy and paste, you cannot disable the DNS license
- I guess. Yeah, so, I think those are scenarios where I want to take rules from policies, just copy ‘em in the RAM,  and be able to paste them wherever the hell I want,
Excel or a different ACP policy. I see value in that more used cases than just what I am coming up with right now. So just being able to easily copy rules back and forth between ACP policies… I mean, the only reason… Quickly do… just to copy a whole policy and then delete stuff, - which is a great…
- Okay, I like that logic. Let's do that. So, I have got this firewall right here. And you'll show me how to do this. So I want this policy on a specific firewall, so, what I'm gonna do here is say, right click, copy it. And then run AMS. Whatever or something. So, now I have got this policy. I want to assign it to a specific device. And it already has a policy assigned. That's fine. [unintelligible] Okay. So, I run into this error. Now, this error basically says… That's the specific error I want. Sorry for the dramatic effect, that was not... I could say it, right? Now, I want it to play… It's gonna give me this warning. Now, this warning says, “The policy that requires THREAT license… I do not have a THREAT license. Now, this specific rule for URL. Oh, I have a solve for that, too, by the way. Finish the EOA. Yes. But that's not even… I get past that. The Security tells me DNS. So, I get past that piece, It's ready to deploy and then I go on Security Intelligence. You see this thing here? One of the target devices… Default DNS. No. THREAT license, because of the default DNS policy. So I want to unassign this default DNS policy. How do I do that?
19; ;01:30:03,111 --> 01:35:03,302; ;Go to the… Exactly. So, copy and pasting this would not work for this environment. I had to build a brand-new one from scratch, with no DNS policy. So, what I ended up doing was creating a DNS-blank test policy. Now, this did not work because it still requires license, regardless if it's blank or not. So… Oh, no, this is the default one. What I ended up doing was disabling the DNS rules in trying to apply that. That still didn't work. This might be a bug. Yeah. This just might be some issue where there's supposed to be a "none" option here, for the DNS policy. But there isn't one. Yeah. So for that specific scenario, if I were able to copy and paste the global rules out into a brand-new policy, I wouldn't have had to start from scratch and code 300-some rules. Yeah, it doesn't work. I didn't write a code here… So, yes… copy ACEs, ACLs, whatever out of one ACP to another ACP. So I'm just breaking it up further. We already went through it. Copy into Excel, copy from one ACP to another ACP. [unintelligible] …with an ACP policy. So, yeah. And I think if I point there, indicating that the adjustment of the columns constantly is 100% necessary… So if you are going page to page, and you're looking at specific rules here, certain things that we're not using right now, like destinations on the security zones, get rid of those. All I want to see is my source network, my destination network, my applications, my service URL, and that's it. Like, stuff I'm actually using. So, right click, remove, something like that. So, you want to save the three of these? The last [unintelligible] Yeah, most definitely. Is it across, or is it only per policy? I mean, why not across? It depends. No, I mean, based on your description, that's what I was… Say, for example, you don't have… You are applying this policy to a device which does not have application license for it. So, you remove application column. Yep. But when you go to other policy, it has application license, it has rules, and you don't want that to be there, right? Yeah, maybe in the last saved column, an indicator saying you're hiding columns or something. I mean… I guess I don't really care, as long as it has the ability to add and delete the columns, to add or remove them. I don't really care if it saves. It would be nicer to save. I could see that being problems for you, like you said. On a specific box, you don't see the application column when there might be application rules. …he says that, yeah, yeah, yeah. But you need to know also that there are risks. Because to remove that column, that you might not… [unintelligible] it could work. If there are certain rules, we could prompt, saying that you are not viewing a column, but it has certain rules. - Certain rules.
- Yeah. Yeah. We can work with that. [unintelligible] yeah. I just remember going through, and trying to understand the different policy, and constantly having to expand and… And then as you click the next page, I believe it resets your expand and… [unintelligible] It was really, really annoying to go through. Select these objects. I just want to see the entire network, the source destination. Definitely. I want to see the entire service. I'd also want to see… And this is not our list. Maybe this is something that we should capture, at least internally, is I want to see the description of the rules in the rulebook. I don't want to have to click here. I know why this is here, because you have multiple comment entries. Just the last one there. Yeah, yeah, the last comment will be good to have in there. I don't know. What do you guys think about that? Yeah. I think that's nice. Yeah. But thinking about it, why would you even have 50 comments in a single rulebook? What is the logic? Why is there the ability to add infinite amount of comments per rule? Why not just one comment you can edit? Yeah. So, if we click a rule, and we go to comments… So I've got no comments. I want to do a test. I mean, I think it was really hard… See… You see there's one now, and now I want to edit this… Can't edit comments. So I add a new comment. I think that was the way for them to do the… Change something.
20; ;01:35:03,950 --> 01:40:03,990; ;- Somebody adding another port or something.
- If you add a ticket there, we can refer to your ticket, go back to… I saw an “Edit” icon next to the… It's only there till you save it. Until you save…Hold on. So, that's weird. It actually got rid of my old… Oh, because I didn't save it. Okay, so now I've got one comment. It should say “pride”. I'm gonna add a new comment, and say “test”. Saved. And now this should increment to two columns. Yeah. I don't get the need to ever have more than two comments per rule. Even if you have multiple comments, I prefer a character than an individual entity. I don't know if there's logic behind any of that, if that's a reason. It's already there. What you want is to be able to view the comment, right? Yep. It'd just be nice to be able to view comment, edit a rule, and make that field searchable. So, like I added “pride” in the comments, it does not come up. Or there's 150… [unintelligible] It doesn't search that. So, it would be nice to be able to search for comments, so if I have got a specific change number, I want to know where is that rule that correlates to that change. How would I find it? There's no way to search it. And maybe that's a query field, a field in the query that we want to get into. If we could've done this… I thought we did this, and it's just… I am not sure whether… I think Mohan did this one. This specific one is… I mean, this goes back to audit who made the change. I think this was our solution, to try to see… To extract the data, who made the theme. One of the reason is, I don't think we get the historical changed data, who made what changes in that policy, so we are trying to pull the information and save it in some file, I guess. Yeah, but obviously, API works only like what they expose on their data model, right? - So, it's not…
- same limitation. Yeah, same limitation whether it's a GUI or... Understand the problem, right? Any way of getting after the API will be, I think… [unintelligible] So… Multiple administrators make changes to policies, so I think the idea here is, two people are editing the same ACP policy. [unintelligible] Hold on, here. I don't see how this would have worked. I am on your side, but that's what. I don't know about that, if that… What that one is for. I don't know. Multiple administrators. I'm gonna look at our gap analysis, because our gap analysis was a lot more clear and detailed. I just want to say like, when someone is editing a policy, it needs to be locked. Yeah, and that's what it is. That's how CSM works, that's how any of the tools we've looked at would work. No, I mean, you want to lock the whole policy? The ACP policy that you're ending, yeah. No, I mean if you are doing, like, access control policy, and maybe CH2 is the most used access control policy… - So, two people at the same time…
- Yeah. how would that work? [unintelligible] Your screen would have to adjust. I mean, you'd be looking at, like, - really tiny change to theirs
- I guess You have some kind of a status phase where it is constantly says, “Look, there are two people making changes in this policy.” I don't know. [unintelligible] I don't know if it'll ever work. They weren't able to do that with... I don't know. I mean, I am not sure if I put that in or not, but that… [unintelligible] So, thinking about it from policy inheritance perspective, if I'm making a change to a policy that's inherited from a global, I should be able to make that change without locking up the global, and vice versa. Is that there yet? - Yeah. So, at the very least, I want that, but… I mean, I think it would be nice, considering how big our policies are, and the amount of work. We have one guy doing GSP changes. He has literally dedicated eight hours a day to coding firewall rules in FMC. He hates this product because of it. It's very painful for him, but it prevents anyone else from going in there to make changes as well. Yeah, I mean, right now, the multi-tier firewall, the net services firewalls are the most used, you know, policies out there. So whenever someone is making the changes, until and unless that activity is submitted and approved in CSM, we cannot go and make any additional changes is our policy. But I mean, in this case, you don't really have to submit and approve your activity.
21; ;01:40:04,034 --> 01:45:01,346; ;You just have to save it and you have to exit out and somebody else can go and make changes. So you don't have that, I mean complexities here to make. So not really needed. [unintelligible] just to make changes. [unintelligible] Multiple administrators, can you see this? No, We don't want to do it with that one. We want to.... I just don't know how possible that's going to be. Well, it's a story to write so that we... [unintelligible] You can have multiple activities and every revision in the policies is locked to that research specific. And you can rule that revision that certain uses are made. Yes. So that's why we have multiple activities in the same policy. Maybe they can't work in the same rule at the same time, but, you know, any other rule. Okay. We'll leave it. We're going to have policies like you said, we have firewalls that are always locked by somebody within the CSM department. It's a huge pain for us and you've mentioned this will be on the CSM side. We have 25 requests being queried every day. - It's not going to be assigned to the same engineer.
- Yeah It's not practical either. So if... I mean and... There will always be some positions that are more used than the other firewalls. Our store policies are mostly static and I don't know how it will change when we'll deploy these next-generation fireworks? How frequently we will make the change? But the policies that we are looking at and I know that at any given time, if someone is not making, it will just be one person who will be making change and that somebody will be in the line waiting for that change to come. So. I mean having ability to multiple users work on the same policies but we may restrict them at a rule level trying to... Yeah. Not any individual will make or two individuals will not make change to the same rule. Yeah. It gets tricky with the other tabs as well, like SI, advanced off those [unintelligible] [unintelligible] - Common request you see?
- Yeah. Okay. We used to have it so that it went together anytime and that's what it was like the worst case scenario. That's what we have to say. This is not our biggest priority but I know that in the long run, when we use this firewalls more and more, I don't know how we are going to streamline the process of being IP and must we can, going UPS and all that. If we cannot achieve that end, if we get that same 25 requests of being coded each and every day and then I know that you know you will have some. - "Oh! Look, you are making changes, I have to create".
- Yeah We have that all day today and if some of these features don't get addressed like the object machine so just drop the subscription there or let their employee without any track. Some rules, like I said, could be twenty-three minutes, and that's working at a fast pace trying to get a single rule. Our requests aren't single rules and it could take someone like 4-5 hours to get a request done and stay up to date? Because there is no query in the database either, right. I don't think when project managers are asking them to create good firewall rules. They are going to use that Search button to see whether that individual host has started off the network which allows that whole access or not. And I know that we can go ahead and look at that auditing feature and still history has sonars, that they don't hear about that auditing feature either. Right? They don't' care about the overshadowed rules of consolidated, unless if [unintelligible] if you add it that rule, you can save it with checkpoint or something. - You have an option
- Oh yeah! [unintelligible]
22; ;01:45:01,401 --> 01:50:01,543; ;No. I know. I mean why didn't even you have to add to the rules. What would have been really valued adding a duplicate rule? Fine, give me an example, why don't you let me into role? I like the fact that it tells you it's duplicate, but everyone is just going in there and deleting the rule. I mean why does it even allow you to add a duplicate rule? When will there ever be values to having 2 exactly having same rules? If they have the exact security zones, service destination, whatever, I mean it doesn't make sense. One time, it might happen is when there is an overly permissive rule, you are adding in this permissive granular rule, you know, not the same exact over this permissive rule. That's the only thing. Yeah. A duplicate. Definitely at why you even like that. [unintelligible] So what happens around the scheduling from the jobs, I didn't add this entry in there, I thought the scheduling of jobs was fine. What sort of enhancements are we looking for? I don't know, [unintelligible] get the job? And wasn't it earlier when we were talking about it, I think we solved that [unintelligible] to catch the schedules. I think the idea was, you know, right you can only select devices and assign them to a group and deploy a group, but back up. Oh, oh yeah. AX walked us through a way of creating a group and deploying to a group. So we are thinking from a store level how could automatically deploy all these boxes without checking a box every time and say: [unintelligible] You just specify the store group and make sure the device view gets into that group. - So I think we saw all that of now.
- Yeah Yeah. Yeah. That was for... we were trying to... we have a couple of firewalls and we have to selective use of firewalls. You know when I wish I was doing a better job of reviewing some of these three. Yeah. So, we have gone through this one. It seems like there is a lot to duplicates on your sheet there. That's the duplicate, yes, seems it [unintelligible] - This is a good one.
- So the ability to do some captors on both units from FMC at the same time, not separate captors. What you need some..... So walk through that. - If you guys aren't familiar.
-  From CLA or we'll start from that. Yeah. See the cluster exact capture. It's not possible in the backups. But, you basically, so say, this specific pair of firewalls right here, we want a troubleshoot option here. To say, capture, otherwise, we at the individual activity troubleshoot options, when we click on it and then you can capture on the individual. Nine times out of ten, ten times out of ten, you're going to do the same capture on both. So either the ability to copy that capture field and paste it in the other one or make it simple and just add a cluster troubleshooting here. Don't do clustering in a single management [unintelligible]. Doesn't make sense to me actually. Yeah, yeah. I don't get why it was like that. So for standby, sure because there is no, I don't know. You don't need to just to understand - where you actually.
- Oh yeah. I know, but, why not just have a troubleshoot button up here? And that's it and when you click the troubleshoot and then it shows you the clusters device was so no matter what you get here, you could [unintelligible] on before boxes, or you have options to stick to clusters. I think there are different ways to take this. We can add another troubleshooting button on that cluster. So you can capture and the troubleshooting from a cluster perspective. Similar to everything you would do as a cluster exec command. So a cluster exec show can, I mean, that's another reason to go to the CLI is for the connection table. That's not something that's displayed here. You can have that command line. So command [unintelligible] Yeah very very limited shell command. - Other to [unintelligible]
- So you can add like that. I don't know what. I don't really use this often. It's terrible. Yes. It doesn't show you in action. Connection detail, like that? Show conn, it should give you the connection. Yeah There's no cluster. Cluster exactly may I comment here. That's what the individual. Maybe there's no connection which will help this. Oh. There's 10 in UNIX. [unintelligible] So yeah I think there are reasons. Honestly I haven't played around this one because I am CLI first myself and I'd rather just go to CLI; and those commands that I run are from the cluster exec perspective. I don't want to look at the connection. I don't want a have two console sessions open and constantly have to run the same commands on both. I just log in to one cluster, check and that's all. Cluster section captures your all captures.
23; ;01:50:03,186 --> 01:52:57,873; ;Yeah and you can go to the CLI, you won't know, you've made that thing and you are not using it. - [unintelligible]
- Capture? - Yeah.
- Oh yeah! You don't want that. You have to restrict that to maybe only a few person until they fix it as long as you have FTD or [unintelligible] I mean [unintelligible] were some in-depth [unintelligible]. You may have to give a disable expert mode in FTP. Yeah. [unintelligible] So this was on same settings around that really get copied at the same time - [unintelligible]
- Yeah. I think we've covered it. So you may be able to use groups... the same thing from here. So I think it hits the list, I mean there is a lot of information. So I've get one additional one that we didn't cover, I guess that's on our list. Maybe just use the talking points that weren't on your list. But a lot of these tasks. So within FMCA if we look at even the deploys. So I look at deployments, right. What is this? How long the deployment took? That's how long. No. I know I just saw it and never seen that before. [unintelligible] So that's how long the job took. [unintelligible] This is really exciting. I've never seen that before. I have never seen that before. What is missing there is one minute 45 seconds ago scheduler. It's not a node. You guys are [unintelligible] that wrong. That's... No. How long the job ran? It was in 07/11/17. So our problem has been when this job run? When? When? And like hovering over anywhere except that sign doesn't give you that. - I have no idea that was there. - [unintelligible] you were already there.
- Yeah I know, I know. Woohoo. You [unintelligible] bro. Well, let's actually look on the other tab. Happy hour. Finally, we left on a good note. You did it! Is this of [unintelligible] Okay, some of these like four channel [unintelligible], not receiving any packet. [unintelligible] is the face we have individual sub-interface is fine. Is there any way on the help monitor section? I just disabled this, so I keep quit this alert every single day saying my port channels are... [unintelligible] We've done that, I just wasn't sure if there's something else. No, it's simple and getting granular, what you can practice. And I don't really care about the timestamps here and[unintelligible]. Now this... Oh crazy! Haven't we [unintelligible] As you learn the tool more, you will...
- You know why?
1; ;00:00:01,225 --> 00:05:08,865; ;Source destination, whatever services that you are looking for. And so, in that access control policy, this rule is already allowed. We can even… And then expose that policy to the users to be able to check whether that global policy already allows that rule. I mean, global access is controlling your… No, I was saying the policy. I mean if the page would do that. I don't know if it's a separate dialog box that will appear after you click on that query page, but as long as it queries that policy and then  looks for whether that policy is allowed, if that rule is allowed or not. So right now, if I put the IP, it will show, like, where the object is, right? But there is only one IP.  There are seven pages here, so even if you –  Right, if you wanted to do multiple, like, I mean, rule is not made by just one IP. It's a source destination [unintelligible] … Right? More than five layers, this is layer seven. So, there will be more than having URL. I… Basically, it's a querybuilder kind of thing, where you can designate and/or… So that IP is based on... Should be in source or destination or application if you already know that you are looking for this particular application. And while we are here I think there's got to be the simplest fix for what they're asking for. But you see how it says “display 1 of 49 rules”? Yes. Can it zoom out? Why can't that be selectable? Why can't – Try minus, minus. So, they can see all the rules in one page, right? ‘Cause we're now going to have to go... Where is the zoom? Right now? So, this is to display all the rules so that it can go down... At 50%, we can see around 18 lines. It's going to be tricky, but… I mean, you have this all this – why this space on the top? Let's not talk this way. Because the way the UI… You're the one to design that? No. Well, I totally understand.  Do I increase.   Yes, because this internally... We can expand it, for sure. Like, make it intervals, make it two intervals, might be more, but how many scrolls obviously much harder to do… A policy is what like 2,0003,000 rules.  I think I look... I always look I need something more than [unintelligible 00:02:35] Yes. You know, I think – So, let's go back to the… Maybe to the Access Policies page. If we can do that and go to the Access Policies page. So in here you can generate a report, right? The report that is in there is like, 70, 80 pages and is not legible. So, if in that policy, maybe in some way, instead of that policy being 100 lines of scroll, maybe if we can query that rule, and then it creates another dialog box, which gives that, instead of when somebody trying to make these changes, I guess… I don't know how it works in the back end, when you are doing the services. [unintelligible] But for certain queries we need, you can create the whole page with the policy. Because, when we do that PDF generation, it's not legible at all. Got you. That goes the same with XOS, right? Exporting the policy to Excel. Yea. Then also like, sometimes like, you know, like, people will ask like, ok. Can you send us the... all your access rules, access control policies? And we have to generate that, and like, I mean, maybe just copy and paste, right. Just yesterday, right?  Copy this. And just like ok, these places are all the rules. Or something like that. Just yesterday, we were in this, this is a CS, this is our cloud exchange firewalls. So, these are directly behind the Google instances, Google cloud instances. So yesterday they asked the question, we have anyany [unintelligible] on the bottom of this page. So they asked how… When are you going to remove the anyany? So, if you could provide the report that is legible to the project managers, then we can say, “If these rules look good to you and your app team, in the Google team, maybe we can remove the anyany. You know? Or something like that. But right now, it's all in monitoring and  we have anyany rule, so the firewall  is just there to have visibility in the application rules.  I'd will believe that today…  I think we have that. It's under, like, enhancement or something. If we have it, let's just stay on it and [unintelligible]...  Yeah So, I was just adding that in the query page, because maybe that was just integrated… Actually, do you want us to get counts per device or just for profit of policy?
2; ;00:05:08,985 --> 00:10:02,340; ;So, in checkpoint , we were discussing this earlier… So, you have a policy that is applied to several devices, in this case stores, you know of course, data center device, firewalls. And then in those devices, if you click on that individual policy rule, it will tell you this device has – for this rule, it has this many here. So I don't know how much deeper that you can get to in terms of selecting devices and doing that kind of stuff. We were still open to, cause we're taking our plans from [unintelligible] so, it's our job to test ways. But, if the policy is shared in the beginning, I guess as long as the rule is being hit in somewhere in the firewall, because now you are sharing… When you talk about policy, then you are sharing it across multiple firewalls. So as long as we know that one of the firewalls – if that crew last yesterday or the latest day when it hit, that's good enough for us right now. So, yeah. He wants us to get away from CLI. The only way to see the accounts is to use CLI or to build individual ATP account tables or... That comes under the auditing feature, because if the rule has not been hit in the last six months, then why keep it there? So what you guys are saying is: the workflow in the CLI is exactly what you need right now. We just need to fall into that. The workflow in the CLI? I mean, the troubleshooting steps in the CLI is...  No. If you do a [unintelligible] policy on CLI, try to correlate that with the actual access control policy, it's not as easy as just looking sidebyside. I don't know. I think it's their accounts page, look at the accounts from CLI, I mean, Mohan can pull up one of our FTDs and show you what the outline looks like. But what I would like to see... I'm sorry I don't know where you guys left off in this conversation, but in the rule base I want to see the hits, similar to what we get in CSM. Refresh the account under a specific rule, and you can actually see if that rule is being used or not. And then you should be able to see kind of like micro frozen match up rule. So if your rule is 10/8, and you see 10.1.1.1.1. hit that rule, it should show you that 8 10.1.1 hit that rule. Not that this rule was used because we want to eventually tighten up those rules. And if we have an anyany, how do we audit it? We have to use connection events, we only have six hours go by, blah blah blah. That is tricky. But okay. Did you guys already capture this? I just captured this. But it was not discussed earlier.  This is interesting. But I think that a lot of the things that we are asking for can be... because I did on several stages. But at first, we want to be able to see the hitcounts in that particular rule of the policy, and then we can go from there, when we drill down to that rule. Which device is using that rule for... in that policy? And then what are the traffic being used? That comes... then it is going to query the events also in the backend, to look at that, right? Which firewall, I mean, those are the things [unintelligible] question. Is there...  Would you like to see the outcome from the time when the rule was created or it only matters for the past six months? Because in the past six months, it doesn't give you good auditing… …[unintelligible] tighten it, and only last six months is what we want. Or is it something which from the life of when the rule was created, till now? I might say research in months would be, or window there just in case, God forbid, we have a process that runs once a year. If you're cleaning up every six months, somebody is gonna go: oh, it hasn't been hit in six months. We don't need it. And then, you know, come tax season, we're actually quick building or remove that rule. So right now, we have a policy in place that says: hey, you have to test all the firewall rules, otherwise we're ripping them out. We don't have anything like that for app teams, people think you put it in, it's there forever. The only time we actually rip hitcount rules out... the last time we did it was probably four years ago because... in our environment, CSN was never accurate when it depicted hit counts. It would show zero hit counts when there would actually be hit counts that do show access list. So there was kind of some issues on the CSM side that prevented us from moving forward with actually removing rules unless we did CLIbased audits. The CLI is always accurate. But CSM was never accurate. So, Avosec's workflow, the workflow that Avosec has, is when you saw that 0hitcounts rule. You created a ticket for that rule. In the backend, it integrated with services now, and open a service ticket to say okay, this rule we are going to remove this rule for, decommissioning that.
3; ;00:10:02,460 --> 00:15:00,010; ;I mean,  I know that you guys, I mean it's open now. So, maybe you should be able to integrate the service, now. So whenever we are decommissioning that particular rule in the policy, maybe in the backend we can give you the ticket. So that way we can keep track of rules that we are removing, and even if we are removing that rule, even if we have to put it back, we can tie that, take it back. And that is something we can totally give to L2 when you get to that level, right? When you have open tickets, to remove… Not just, “Oh, look I added this rule, so I know that rule is not being used, so I can remove it.” You guys want to pull anything in from the CLI to the group, please don't take it out of the CLI. I spend 90% of my time in the CLI, so to lose feature already there I don't think any customers are saying, “Get rid of the CLI!” I mean even beyond that, I end up dropping in expert mode a lot on your boxes. So… A lot of the troubleshooting, you know, like, updating search, because every time I've updated the search for the GUI, it crashes the entire box. [unintelligible] So, you mentioned the ability to see the part of the objective first set. And the rule has like 5...  If [unintelligible] and interesting example: we built work flows within a connection to that or within the event… to kind of… Find itself that kind of anyany.[unintelligible] We don't want to have to have workflows for every single rule. It's PCI requirement to log every single rule, so you have to know when a rule's being hit. You have to retain those logs for 13 months, so we want to, at the very least, log… Allow some blocks so we have some sort of loopback troubleshooting data, and that PCI historical data. But the ability within the ACP policy to see that the rule is hit from a network content's perspective – so if I have an object that has, like, 15 different networks in it, I want to know which one of those network's hit, and it'd be nice to know which IP in that network hit. So kind of understanding the actual connection. That will be helpful... Each time it does it or just the last it would be? I think the last hit is – the last hit date for each flow is good. That's what we've got as a CSM. You could see all of the flows that match that rule from a hit count perspective, and it looked like it worked great. It didn't work as good as it looked, but it looked good. And then if somebody modifies the rule, last to modify, who did it? In CSM, we have a ticketing setup. It's a ticketing system that integrates with ServiceNow. We basically put the ServiceNow URL, and then we key in our specific string, which is going to be an ST task number that you have to get signed with somebody. As we code firewall requests, we have them create an activity with the FC task name. So… And they also reference that FC task in their description rule. So every single rule, you can basically click the ticket, it pops open ServiceNow from a link, and then boom. You see the actual ticket, who requested it, who coded it, who approved it, everything having to do with the rule. One thing to do with AC Policies requirement is to comment every time… We do that. We have a request around that, the ability to delete comments. Because right now there's no ability to delete comments, and we do a lot of rule copies. So we end up with 15 different comments that don't even explain the rules anymore. I mean, the most recent comment will explain the rule, but previous 14 comments have nothing to do with the rule anymore. Modify the search…[unintelligible 00:13:36]  CSM has a team… [unintelligible] Or at least, ‘cause I understand, like, you really don't always want certain people to do sometimes the comments from a [unintelligible] or some people say allow a customer to delete it. [unintelligible] Yeah. We turn t at on and off a couple of times, just because we've had to manipulate the login rules, so we had to enable login every single time for, like, 200 rules individually. So that's another request I'd like to make. The ability to highlight multiple rules, and then enable each of those rules, like, enable log at this level [unintelligible 00:14:17] It took me about four hours, on every single rule to go back and add the login to make everyone log in. [unintelligible] tabs for greyed out everything above action in inspection login. Basically, those are the ones that could be [unintelligible]  Inspection login?  Yeah. Yeah. So, click on inspection login, click on inspection. So you got your file policy and truth policy and variable set. Yeah. So I had to do the same thing. We had to enable IPS on every single rule and I had to double back and go through and enable login. Yeah. Are majority of your rules have the same IPS policy applied?
4; ;00:15:00,546 --> 00:20:00,800; ;For us, it's exactly the same. But again, we haven't worked with you guys to define the policies, we're just going off what you said, and we just enable every single rule that makes sense. So some of the rules that doesn't even make sense to have IPS policies on, or file inspection policies, so we didn't enable any, but majority of the rules, yes. We have one file policy and then we have one attribute. That's a separate request. I'm gonna highlight… I'm gonna go back to topic, right? So if this went back to global policy, and it was one boxset and it's overrideable, I think that would be the winner, right? If you said that from the global policy perspective, those tabs, then per rule override…  that only I that would be the …  That would be the...  I still like the idea of multiple selection. Yeah, just highlight the bulk, but I also like to say ‘Hey!' an auto one hundred here at home need this I don't want to go through ten. Select 10 and change it once again. I think a lot of the control click and the copy and paste stuff here needs more improvement. So, okay we have full… Yeah, I think in the beginning of the POC, we're looking at number of clicks that's required to create a rule for Cisco or [unintelligible]... I think it's going to require like four or five clicks to create the rule boxes, but Cisco requires 26. Yeah... Watch me create a one single rule, it took me 23 minutes. 23 minutes for one single access control policy rule. Well, it's definitively not timesaving. All right, if this was not selfexplanatory…  It is. Well, then I think we're all pretty clear of the workaround. Again, that workaround, to me, is not a feasible workaround. We deploy this firewall 1015 times a day. Saving copies of the policy before every single deployment is not feasible. Reverting to a previous database and having all of your firewalls revert is not a feasible option, so… How many firewalls do you need? Twenty. Twenty per day, so 100 per week. Fiftytwo weeks in a year, that's 5,200 across the year. I think one year we did over ten thousand firewall requests. So I guess that the biggest after this, Well… well, it shows. I think that's what you call a critical mass, right? Of all the things that's on here that say different things, they say if you, like, highlighted one particular one, you delete any acceleration possible. I think this would be acted out so number one. We only go forward, never look backwards, right? You know, I go for… I think we need a new firewall. One second. Do we have anything more to say about that? And again, a lot of our priority one stuff, I don't think these are callspecific. I think any customer is gonna benefit from all these changes, and they make sense. But what we need to discuss is we definitely need to have a cabin and a document that writes down how frequently do you want to copy the policy or what is our approach to it, you know, when we decide to go to Cisco. Because, I mean, it looks we're not getting anything until at least a twomonths period, and then it might hit the… So, right now, what we'd end up doing is restoring the entire FMC as they back out, from the day before, because we're not replicating all the policies before every deployment. That would not be feasible. We overrun something right away. So that is something we need… The actual PROD policy for [unintelligible] We have to work on a backup plan. I think that the workaround is we're gonna have to come up with a solid… Well, I mean, not yet, but we will. Because in the CSM world, the rollback feature probably didn't work the best, but we did use it often. And if we didn't use that, we at least use the activity report to see who did what exactly, and reverse the changes by coding them. We don't have the ability within FMC to do that. An example of that is, we're doing the CSM migration from 4.7 to 4.12 in January, and we imported a policy that advance sources gave to us. And in that policy, there was a bug, that basically… After sorting line number 15, or 17, or something in our store header in the firewall, which is our integration for all the stores that we have been growing so far, it said below that rule everything is… There's nothing there. So we just have 17 rules… So that was like a database restore that went wrong. Yes, so, the moral of the story is:
5; ;00:20:01,122 --> 00:25:00,070; ;a rollback feature, you know, and since we got hit so hard in January, we would like to see at least some level of rollback tested out before we go into production. Yeah,  that would be like… And when something happens, it's three of us trying to resolve that issue. If… Like you just said… If this is gonna be pushed back to 18 months, what can we do at 12 months that kind of like makes it a little better? Like an automatic policysave. If that's all you can do in 12 months, that would be great. Before every deploy, have it force an automatic policy save.  Right. It is not perfect, but if that is, like, all we can get in a 12month period, I think it's like okay, that's something to get our stores were… Yeah, and then we do a couple of, you know, disaster scenarios, so we just say, “Okay, policy when, you know, completely blank, somebody put an any in a front of access policy or we lost the policy, or something like that, five different scenarios, and present it to the project team before they make any major decisions, you know. This is definitely a showstopper until and unless we find a workaround for it... a solid workaround. Look, it sounds pretty easy… This is a huge pain for us, we are constantly having to have the access control policy and the object database open to figure out what the rules do. So this goes along with the query, based on the query search destination ID, to see if it will allow it. This goes along the same lines of just... I don't know what these rules are until I look up every single object, because, yeah, we're getting away from IPs, and we want to become IP agnostic, but it never seemed as very IPcentric, and we need to understand what's in these rules to kind of digest them, you know? Do you guys use our object override? Yes, in our CSM world, we definitely use object override on almost every single firewall. That is when you are not looking at a specific device view, what is that? Yeah. That's a good question and that is something that we actually thought through. Understanding if you're looking at an ACP policy from the policy view versus the device itself… I don't know. I mean, I guess I would want something, maybe the contents. From the device or from the policy view, it should give me all of the levels. It should not give me the overrides, right, you shouldn't even… Maybe you have a star on there indicating that there are overrides for that specific object. Some indication that there are overrides, and then you could switch the view to more devicespecific to get the actual value. A lot of our requests are gonna be objectbased groups versus network objects here. If you hover over this network object right here, you can see the concepts. Oh, no, you don't. Well, that's the group.  Are these the network objects? Yeah.  So if the single, you see the contents of this multiple, means you see multiple rules?  Yes.  Okay. So some consistency between… I mean, I'd like to just hover over this.  If you're not going to give me the hover, give me a delay, right click and show the contents right on the screen without opening the object database. Right now, if you right click one of these, you get nothing, right? Yes, so cut, copy, edit. Can I ask you… [unintelligible] Okay, good. Yeah, that was one that at first probably ones that I think seemed like it was something we can squeeze into January, but… It's just really painful without… And I think Puri will address this in a way, but I still want the ability to just kind of lift up the objects to know what they are. Either right click, show, or hover giving it literal definitions. It would just be helpful for me. I know the engineer that coded this knows what every single rule is for. They know the project, they know the objectnaming schemes, whereas me, I'm not associated with the google project. So I go in there, I'm like, “What the hell is all this?” So, as a scale… You know, obviously, in the last… The 4,500s came out, with 750 limits, and… So their architecture is gonna look like this. It is going to be 1,100 stores, give or take, two firewalls in HA per source. So it's 2,300 firewalls, but it seems like if there was a way to bring up 750 higher, knowing that… So right now, we have the run four FMC [unintelligible]… For...  300 [unintelligible]. So, we need multiple, right, so knowing that it's HA, knowing that its Branch, knowing it's a single config, what can we do? We are kind of solving the automation… We're solving the Stuart Huxley, I think it's the thing?
6; ;00:25:00,403 --> 00:30:01,520; ;He's gonna write a custom automation script that basically synchronizes all [unintelligible]. So he said that… And this is what we are going to talk about later. …is that he withdrew FMC's automation script. Their team is going to write a script that basically synchronize policies. So that's what it comes to, if we have to have multiple FMCs. So we are going to have a master unit, would be my vision of this. You're mastering where everyone goes to make changes. And then we'd have slave units that get [unintelligible] automatically too. So the idea here would be, we have a 1,400 source, 1,300 source, or whatever we are going to have at the time. In HA, we have the exact ACP policy, exact file inspection ITS policy, pretty much a very consistent policy across the board, and then we make changes in the master, and it would replicate on the backend objects and policies. So you only have to make the change once, and it is not a single pin [unintelligible] but it is replicated on the backend. We would still want the ability within each FMC to have a local policy. To be able to use case for this, we're deploying this rule box at the source. With the rule box for the firewall rules that aren't there, it's only gonna get one store as a POB. So… Come say “hello” to you. [unintelligible] taking all their jobs… I've seen one of those at a tech show… [unintelligible] So, there's gonna be, like, RFID robots that go around in the middle of the night, and inventory, order, reader… Whatever they are. Well, yeah, if they're going to POB or POC the store, I want to be able to go into that. So, like, FMC that manages that specific box and add that. So I think that's where we're gonna run into issues with this whole replication process. I mean, [unintelligible]. Okay, okay. I don't know what helps. It's interesting. I kind of want to talk what deputies stopped at work, but I'd have to dig in… And I think we are trying to separate the scalability versus the usability. But I think at least giving you guys an idea of every little thing we need from startup…  Run those FMCs… HA? Yeah, we got 10 FMCs. Ten of them in a deployment where there's actually five active rule books. [unintelligible] So that is going to obviously complicate… [unintelligible] I don't know what this gentleman's solution's going to be, but preferential to the option to say, “Hey, we lost this pair for whatever reason, one need to master this one.” Or scale. Or do it all in one, Can it be that hard? All hardware to some giant box or [unintelligible]. Option to orchestrate FMCs, can we pull FMCs? Maybe it is one rack, make it five rack. One new server, no wonder it can't do anything. So I guess the limitation of work… Maybe if we worked with you, you'd understand, especially when we get to actual rule… If we get really close, is there anything we can do to go beyond 750, or because of this architecture, is that gonna be the absolute threshold? Average of this goes above 750. Well here's the other question: should we even attempt to put the 750,  Yes if you have any customer that actually have 750. Because the last customer that we talk to had 4 or 5 variables. We haven't been able to find a large customer of FTD. I don't know if there's anyone using FMCs, to be honest. [unintelligible] Yeah I mean you haven't found like more than 100 right now, where we deployed more than 100 FTDs so synchronization might not be their biggest issue not even obvious.  But I did ask.  Yeah  We have been knocking this right now. I have to get a lot of customer reference...  The products are new and self acceptable I mean we get it but it just got scary not knowing are we going to be our [unintelligible] customer? We definitely… Yeah, I think we did that with I1 when we had first I1 customer and Yeah I do wanna go back to that. Right, so you just mentioned that, I1, you were a beta I1 customer and it went through development and there was a close relation with the… And at the time, I was the largest I1 customer, what you say it was a successful project? I think it was a successful project and that's probably because you have partnered so well. Unfortunately the hand up he has never done so no one understands how works except person who found the project. We also don't have live action anymore.
7; ;00:30:01,839 --> 00:35:06,487; ;We have no way to tell what's happening at each store without logging into the store. So if you guys give us a solution that requires a third party management... I know I didn't like that. I didn't like it I thought what you guys should have offered some sort of service to manage the I1 solution. Not live the action piece. I don't like that part. I mean, it works but it's kind of a difficult situation because we don't have class action and market so... You don't want to worry you know it is getting them to the right times of those during the years of development phase. But but in the end I think I was very positive [unintelligible] and still is. We're looking to roll another place to that are way hotter. But even one of them with the savings that's just... Sometimes you catch things in the development cycle but you'd rather not wait, based upon those small thing that mark...  But we don't have the time to wait because we have to complete these firewalls.  Right  That's why we pushing so hard for these features to be... not over a month.  Right. Checkpoints don't start. Yeah, okay. So, we lost this … No, I'm still here. So, we're already past that... We're past this, you guys know what we need. Ability to view content from hovering over it, we're good with that. Our service group, features plus to add ports to a group, we don't have any. So, this is the rule that took me 23 minutes to create. So, yeah actually. [unintelligible] Damn right, we can! Yeah. I need to see if I can actually, I'm not quite sure. So, this becomes a problem when I have a rule, say any temp services. Now the example I gave him was …services, and we had a request for that. So, we have a rule that requires temp services. You basically have to go in there and create object groups for each service individually and then you have to put these into a service group object. You cannot put ports directly into a service group object. Now, on ASA you can, on CSM you can, on ASDM you can… I know…and here you have to create individual objects for each individual port. Now we have since created an API script to kind of, format some of that. But it still is something, it would just be you're giving me a request and I excel that, we copy and paste them out, we just want to paste them in the FMC. We don't want to have to go through and create 50 objects just to accommodate one firewall request in our firewall service group. So I can step these through that if that wasn't clear enough. Go to Objects, I know in AC Policy, you can't make groups, which is a problem.  Yes.  Now, in Objects page, when you're editing a group, you can create an object from that group. So, this object right here, we got this, now, say I want to add 20 IP. Yes. Like one at a time? One at a time. Now, you can do if your ranges are contiguous like this, you can do a dash, you know 1.10 and you can do the contiguous range, that's fine. But I can't take an exclusive IP address or network and piece them in here easily. From this view itself, what were you saying I could probably do? You can create network options. Actually this one is not as useful because [unintelligible], if you go to Service or Port. Oh, out of here? Okay. Yeah. And this is what we've had to do and again the same concern here is that you can't see… Oh no, you can in this one. Okay. So now you add a port. Which is this? So now, from here, there's that green icon next to port group. Yep. But this is what you did essentially? Yep. Yep! Every single port I would just name it like TCP389 and the Port389, protocol TTP, okay Save and then it saves this side and then you have to drag it back over.  Yeah… So, everything we do isn't we don't really use network objects very much. Everything we do is object groups, so it's just very easy to dump a bunch of networks into a group or a bunch of ports into a service group. It just makes it very difficult so, if I wanted to add a group, here's my option. There's no option to add ports, they have to be objects, which means I have to then, as a prereq, go in here and add all my individual object groups and then, take them into over… If we're going to add multiple ports at the same time, do you open up the Add Port icon?  This?
8; ;00:35:08,411 --> 00:40:11,612; ;So it would be ok if they don't have to [unintelligible]? If they had the same protocol… Did you place them like 20 or 30…?  You select the AP and then there's a text field where you could just copy everything and everything is…  That's exactly what we want,  yes. And then, I don't know if we have line items for this to go in a little further. I've got a Zabbix here, I need to clean them up. I need to know what's used, what's not used. How do I do that? There's no way. You can't say, ‘Hey, tell me where the' – Yeah, you tracked it, ‘Tell me where this object is used. Is it on any policy? If a down policy, are those policies assigned to devices? Basically, are these used or not?' And there's no way to tell that or say like, ‘Where is this used?'  And we currently use that in CSM for all your teams?  Oh yeah,  yes, we…  And, it is…is it per item or even within each one of them? So, what I would like to see here is another column,  that says usage.  Used Or something like that that I can then click something on, like a checkbox that says that it's used and then once you open that, it'll tell you which policies it has used up. Maybe a filter… Take a policy, pick up a filter. Yes, yes. The checkpoint also had to clear user authentication. Yes, yes, the checkpoint had a similar allocation as a and maybe that's not a big issue for other people but some vendors, we like to say, ‘Okay, we'll give you this group of ports. So they might be your support ports to your specific servers. So we'll call their destination servers, like Cisco – host, that'll be all the hosts they have access to and then we night have Cisco  VPN  services, every single service we're allowing Cisco to use to their host over the VPN. It'll just be easier to dump those into group objects. Yeah, true. You audit objects as well? Yes! Because we brand those innovations that the project database has and every time you import a device, if you don't have an objectoverride enabled for the device underscore 1. The object usage would help that as well… that if the object is not used at all, it's easier for you to… Yeah…we can just sort in CSM we can just sort this column by ‘Used' or ‘Not Used' and then just highlight them all. Sure, yeah. Now, how many object did you get up to before you hit the data limit? Within CSM? About 6,000 – 7,000, it wasn't a lot. I mean it was a decent amount to get us our production environment only needs about 900 to 1,000 objects, so most of them were duplicates from imports we had done and the merging that we had done. And then here, it's like, I can't tell if these are used or not or… The CDO has that capability though. [unintelligible] Maybe if you start… You mean CDR? Yeah, everybody's saying CDO… we looked at it last year, and it was not usable but now it seems like… It still needs a lot of features to be included but it's getting there… So, it just manages the policies, right, it doesn't actually… Right now, yes. I mean it manages devices just at a very high level. But, not any device configurations  like interfaces or routing or…  XOS Editor? Yeah… It doesn't do any of that. It doesn't? Okay. GSA Automation model Remember when Davidson first without discussing CDO, remember? That enterprise started [unintelligible] DISA Enterprise Services? He sent the files… What are you talking about? This was the file… I legit never even heard of DSM before I came here. No one has. And anyone who's heard of it, the CDO or CAC, they're just getting annoyed at me because I'm the only one constantly mentioning CSM. Like how does no one know, there aren't like I don't know... A lot of people I guess don't have a footprint. There are people there with hundreds of ASAs that manage them all with ASDM. How do you ensure your security posture is consistent across a 100 ASDM.  They don't, they don't ensure that.  No, you don't. There's like SDOs and so many people managing it…  Server is down I guess.  Yeah, where is it?  Click that folder.  Oh, allocation? What was going on with that? Switching back? No, I'm just trying to get the app analysis… So we're past this…
9; ;00:40:12,588 --> 00:45:07,313; ;Service group feature request to add ports in a group, instead of having to create groups and put them into group objects… [unintelligible] Simplified workflow for object management. Ability to create a group network object, a network object, or a group service object from within our rule. There is the ability to create a service object, but not a group service object, or a service group, I don't know why it says group service object. Same goes for network objects, you cannot create an object with multiple hosts or networks from within our rule. But, I don't think you can get more specific than that, but I can… That's pretty straightforward. Okay, I can show you that, but I think it's pretty clear in there that the consistency of creating a network object versus a group object. If I've got 10 subnets I want to call network security monitoring hosts or networks or something like that, I just want to create a group for that. I don't want to create individual groups and then add it to the group object. I mean, if you could do it with CLI, why won't it be supported in[unintelligible]? That one I think is pretty selfexplanatory. We've done some of the analysis. We transition [unintelligible] usability. Yeah and [unintelligible] we transitioned some of our usability and this is up to debate whether they're usability or management, and maybe it's me not getting some of it right. But now like we are in some of the priority 2, and, Mark, a couple of these in here are yours. I think priority 1 and 2.  That's three.  Feel free to state your case. These are all priority 2, again the categories might be valid…I'm not going to go deep in this, this isn't useful to anything this is an enhancement we need TACACS for FPT and FMC. Right now it's local only, that's a problem. Especially when FXOS uses PACs. I'm going to expand that a little bit, too. The ability to pull out of radius support with your local admin fallback If I were… I want to be able to have that local admin user  on if it's hardcoded to it.  Yep. And right now the work form I got from your support organization was... well, just make your radius server unavailable for this server. Great, so now they're going to take the whole damn chassis  off the network, or I've got to blow radius out of the water. I'm not going to do either of those. You guys have radius servers? You have your own radius servers? No, we hook into the [unintelligible]. Oh, ok ok. [unintelligible] with my backend?  Does it mean it's part of Tech X?  We don't use Tech X honestly. [unintelligible] I don't think you need to go in depth there. I think what he's saying I would expect us to be advised that there is local fallback, that's how all the Cisco stuff works. [unintelligible] None of the rest of the Cisco stuff works this way. Bul**** [unintelligible] [unintelligible] [unintelligible] And it's just... there was no fallback. As soon as I enabled that radius application, admin completely s*** the bed because well... There's no admin user defined in radius. We have to take radius down or sever radius connection like implying that radius is down and then it should fall back to the local. You'll never be able to log into a local comp and a radius comp at the same time unless you did some interesting tweaking. I know that you guys are from the FX/OS team or so, but there was [unintelligible] a certificate both were I think fixed in the new FS/OS...  In 6201. I'm going to have to go back and look, because I'm going to fall up on both [unintelligible] request that were talking to me, the engineer between that and certificates. Let me just find out what the status is… Because we are sitting on as far as of XLS right now we are sitting on 211 [unintelligible]. I'll take the action and figure out where they are cause there's both enhancement requests. There's something [unintelligible] in February, Greg, let's find out about that.  It probably is a bust.  I'll figure it out. I'll find out where those two enhancements… The [unintelligible] sure they work, but we have to rotate the passwords constantly. Every time we lose[unintelligible], every six months we have to rotate those passwords, there's no automated way to rotate these passwords. So yeah. I know in the past other people have written scripts to do exactly that [unintelligible] that is an option.
10; ;00:45:08,546 --> 00:50:06,171; ;[unintelligible] to be managed by FMC entirely.  That that….  Entirely standalone Why is the [unintelligible] that covers the you know… the FMC entirely. Yeah. So there are deployments which got 16 [unintelligible] FTD mode, but I mean, making epic OS chassis consistent configuration is very difficult for us. So we created a CLI script that basically goes in each scope and changes each setting but you can't do everything you need to do in an scope command. So we kind of have a script that helps us maintain consistency but it doesn't work as good as we wanted to. We'd rather... like the point of our hearts is get away from FXOS or have FXOS managed from policy inspected with an FMC. That should be [unintelligible] for nothing instead of rolling the next feature but I think that, I mean, it's a no brainer that FMC can manage FX OS. [unintelligible] So the next one device policy: ability to add group object. I don't know if this is a duplicate from row eleven or if this is possibly something separate but it looks like this one calls out service objects and it also calls out network objects as an issue with an ACP policy. This to me sounds like a duplicate. This device policy [unintelligible] I wasn't sure. [unintelligible] Oh no, ok I know what this is then. Yes, so under platform, or under the device view,  so say the specific the specific cluster. Say one that edit platform settings in the specific cluster. So do we wanna, is there any way you can add note of this so we don't have this question on this row, just clarifying what the row action means. But if you go into based by platform settings, what we wanna do for some of these HTTP: we have a very specific range of hosts that should be allowed to access this firewall from HTTP or FDM, or whatever, or FMC, no, no FMC to HTTP, but we want to put an access list on these boxes for HTTP similar to what we have for ASAs. When you click in, all you can do is add individual IP's or networks. I wanna add a network group. These are individual inner network objects, they don't support group objects. So like we have a group object that contains all of our network support users… There is no group option here just individuals. So I have basically split up our objects that contains 12 networks into their own individual networks. And every time I add a network to that, it's not inherited like if I had a group there, and added a network to the group, it just would be inherited, just be there. I would have to manually log on and manually network. So Derek for that one. Yeah, I got it, line thirteen.  Yeah.  I highlighted the specific device setting  [unintelligible] from setting right?  Yeah. And that HTTP instance I mean there is still ICP I think I have another line item for this one. But it's a similar thing where you can only add networks and not a group. So say admins can ping the interface or same thing for SSH. [unintelligible] All network objects, can create network objects from here but you cannot create groups. Do you guys getting everything under… typing rather quick we are capturing everything [unintelligible] From the UI it might be... Yeah, but lot of backend..  [unintelligible]  I'm not sure why [unintelligible] It just helps this to be a little more dynamic like... We have a lot of building moves we have a lot of consultants so we add on, we repetitiously update our support groups and manually going into all these based policies it's a bit pain. So, FMC to FMC migration discovery of configuration on FTD devices, now I don't want to put this into [unintelligible] perhaps you can clarify. So we are migrating from an FMC instance to an FMC instance, is that what it's supposed to mean? And FTD devices don't maintain the config, you can't discover an FTD device, you have to push the FTD device.
11; ;00:50:06,171 --> 00:55:01,835; ;[unintelligible] you put that thing right in? I've been seen discovery… I think… I think I did it. [unintelligible] Have you really have an understanding, if I wanna move a device from one manager to another manager? Oh yeah, we ‘ve had that problem, OK. So that, we have a lab environment where we've got a [unintelligible] and we wanted to change this into a firewall that was behind the SEM into a production store and we wanted to put it into our production FMC. So as we, as we did that we configured the manager command, I don't remember what happened, but we've never process used that. Yeah, maybe it's the stream on processes. Right? As we start managing multiple… what is our process, is there a way we can clean up that hole? Without taking an outage. I guess pull a device out of one FMC put into another. Yeah, we didn't get like a… streamline answer on that. Part we had FTD devices in our lab FMC and so, deleting the device from the FMC We just pull them in [unintelligible] and then remove the manager command from the FMC  and discovering the product.  Yeah. And while you did that, I think... That [unintelligible] configurations [unintelligible] were discovered  and we didn't have issues there.  [unintelligible] Not the whole configurations but there were some lingering…. I think that particular manager command that was still lingering like [unintelligible] show two managers.  Yeah we kinda…  We aligned and deleted the managers, and I guess the actual process was to never seal live leak t manager, it was just configuring the new manager in FMC would delete the old manager. We, we created a [unintelligible] box when we did that… so we changed the IP address [unintelligible]... we changed the IP address then it was… how do we bring it back right? It was… that would happen, at that point, there was a device who was trying to contact the manager but the manager's IP had changed. [unintelligible] Yeah, because in the lab we had a different IP address we put the vCard environment which had a different IP address, different FMC, and then, we didn't have issues there. And then after that, we pulled that lab from the [unintelligible] and to be a part of the production store. And there, it would have the IP address again. I think we did that FMC. I don't think we did that FMC [unintelligible]  So complicated.  IP address only and we do know the actual process... ...so I think there were multiple address I mean...  someone said “It's OK” maybe half them [unintelligible].  The most CFD was found in one case [unintelligible] Oh my goodness! So if you do any discovery on the FTD it's not going to be there right? The policy is going to be pushed only [unintelligible] discovers. I could not unplug the firewall right now and somehow discover it from a new FMC environment. It's not going to be there, there's no plan for that, I don't think we need that. So discovery configurations on FMC devices, I don't know if we're going to ever need that or there is a need for that. As long as we have our FMC after HA we'll always have our policy to push to the device. Probably not, but [unintelligible] start talking about this. [unintelligible] what would happen. Probably not, but [unintelligible] start talking about this. [unintelligible] what would happen. Yeah obviously there is definitely a big asset for discovery configuration [unintelligible], because [unintelligible] that's what people want,  or what we want...  Really? Yeah. I could see that. Why?  Why? Because [unintelligible] FMC NHA you have daily backups for your FMC.  An argument is we haven't done it yet.  Yeah. Which is good, but it's still be prioritized. It's gonna be work.  [unintelligible] FDD right?  No. But this is one that FDD configuration to be discovered in a new FMC [unintelligible]. Shouldn't it be as simple as configure manager, a new manager IP? Boom and it's discoverable? Oh no, no, it doesn't work like that.... you have to push its policy that you have assigned to the FMC, you can't discover. [unintelligible] the device in FMC and the same in policy.  Yeah Yeah  [unintelligible] [unintelligible] We have waited there from 15 to 20 minutes. [unintelligible] So if we end up have to flip us store over five FMC's, for some reason issue FMC returns, [unintelligible] maybe move some storage around, maybe there are some resource constraints, for some sort [unintelligible] To move an FMC or FTD to a different FMC. That should be a [unintelligible] to that. Defined. That would be part of our…. failover cases synchronizing policy as well as moving that store of firewalls  from one FMC to another FMC.  Yeah.
12; ;00:55:01,873 --> 01:00:00,835; ;Because, I think when we start deploying into the store then we have, I don't know, 300, 350 stores maximum, and then, couple of troubles on how to move it to another FMC, something like that. That's what we should do.  [unintelligible] last one.  No, I'm not.  Yeah.  This is, this is near the mark here, so… as you see 217 right? So dual flow is flipped. Exactly. I mean potentially viewed.  [unintelligible] policy changes [unintelligible].  Yeah. Yes, so say we have changes to block something and it's scheduled with an application team to test a certain time, and they need the console to make smart changes, we don't want them to have to push our stuff in between time.  [unintelligible] deployment.  Yep. You guys [unintelligible] showing sounds like  you've already trying something like that.  Yep.  Okay.  You know that's actively being developed or? Okay. I do not know. It's interesting because I think problems with trying to do that because as your HTTP policy directly correlates to the IDS policy, any DHCP rule will have IDS policies on it. So if you got new rules you bet it, and you want to deploy those and they're able for IDS policy… Maybe that's why they are not there today.  It would be like a quick deployment.  Yep. Where you would have [unintelligible] policy…  ...but still. Yeah?  Yeah. I think 15 would've touched on that right? I... we obviously know it'll be nice for this to be automated, specially [unintelligible]. We had a little bit of fun migrating CSM to FMC. I found out that, you know, it's all possible by how we did it was we went into CSM and merely copied the CSM access control table into an Excel file, discovered device by the script to save objects and then manually created that by staring and comparing all the way down. [unintelligible] I did it on a plane flying back to California. So anyway, I think the point is that it seems that there should be a process. Yeah [unintelligible] thousands of, the migration tool that's out there it's not CSM migration tool, it's just NSA migration tool limited to fifty thousand. Limited to fifty thousand [unintelligible]? Oh now, so when we did our first migration it was fifty thousand [unintelligible] 67 dollars and we had to break that up into two separates. We had to break it down into two separates. I even looked at it recently but it's definitely in the hundred thousands. Okay. Way more than it was. So, a way to get our stuff out of CSM, a way to convert, I think after, after this project or after whatever, we still gonna have hundreds of ASA's out there that we'd like to convert. And all [unintelligible] series, they might not have the SSD, I don't know, I guess at least understanding what is the plan for people that is stuck with [unintelligible] deployments ASA using CSM, how to get those over. Even policies out from CSM.  Two hundred thousand.  Two hundred thousand [unintelligible]. [unintelligible] Oh, wow, okay, PGA and [unintelligible] for a second. So the next line item is pretty important, this is his [unintelligible] few times, so a list of devices in pending changes, now that's there, we know that's there. You pick and deploy, you see there are devices pending changes, you see that there are specific policy changes, not the individual policy name, but we like NCP change and I guess I can share that right now. If were to click deploy, you can see here's our boxes pending delta  or that are dirty, here's what's changing.  Yep. So, that's fine. I like that, but now I wanna know what's changing. What exactly on the access control is changing. Is somebody putting an [unintelligible] there? Is somebody blocking something? Is somebody permitting a… [unintelligible] aggressive role?
13; ;01:00:00,905 --> 01:05:02,340; ;Is there a…with FTP or telnet or some ansible protocol that we don't allow on our network? What's happening? We don't know. Very good question. Now, after it deploys, there is a way, um… Not here. Under… “Tasks”. Yeah, “Show History”. No, “Tasks”. I'm sorry, it's… I clicked it, it popped up over here. Not under “Tasks”, it's under “Show History” of “Deployments”. So, you click “Show History” here, and it gives you 20 histories. 20 is what we'll max out in one day. We need this to be… We need more. I don't know. Two weeks' work to look back, at least. Instead of a hardset number, maybe a hardset date of lookback data. This is a resolution issue, which I think is another line item. But if you look here, you can see... if you click on specifics point, it normally… I don't know what it is. My laptop has a weird resolution. But normally, you'd click this and then you'd click “Transcript”. And this is the actually delta pilot box. I want to see this before I deploy the box. And I wanna see it in a graphical format. So before you deploy, know what you're deploying. But don't be surprised. And I guess to go even further on that, tell me who did it. Tell me what login, user ID made each line item on this transcript. Which one of the associates? You know, this goes back to the workflow piece. And maybe we do need a workflow. Like, somebody is able to submit changes. Another team is forced to approve those changes. Another team has to deploy the changes. A scenario like that, where there is peerreview. But right now, there's nothing to peerreview until after it deploys. But after it deploys, the issue is already present. So, I guess that's our rollback, right? Sorry. Just the last bit. Also, ability to see who deployed it, or… Yes, yes. So… I mean, it's nice to know who made the deployment. If it's offhours and somebody does a manual scheduled deployment, I want to know who did that and broke the protocol. But at the same time, whatever's deploying, I want it to aggregate all of the changes by user ID. Give me an idea of who made each change. If there is one of our L2 guys to put in anyany and someone else try to have a conversation with them about the way our rules work something like that, we need to be able to track that down. We need to be able to audit who did something. That is coming… Who did something is coming. Uh 62, 622. Yep. So it's gonna be an Auto Log so I'll show you where deployments happen. So if you go to “System”. Yeah. So, are you going to show me the Auto Log? And you're familiar with gaps the Auto Log has. Yeah. Okay. And you're familiar with gaps the Auto Log has. Yeah. Okay. And I wanna hear the gaps. I will. There. System Monitor. So, system monitoring auto, manual. So inside here whenever there's a policy change. Gap's not on. There's essentially going to be an icon next to subsystem that will bring up the diff of what happened, so you can see the change and what change they made. Yeah. So, like, when we… We made this change to an excontrol policy… [unintelligible] I don't know what page view is, I don't know… That just means that you need the page. Right now… Yeah, the person… So, I guess…out here, ‘cause there's no way to see what I did. Exactly. Yeah, but… But there are some, like… If you go to “System Integration”, and you configure each [unintelligible]… to, like, select 11 queues and even if blah blah, blah… And you do the edit source on that system audit. Then it will show you the diff of, like… Okay, before, you know, in History, you're only sending the connection events. Now somebody changes it, you, you know… Connection events and, like, all the events. So, there are, like… Only specific feature in FMC, if you change it, they will show the diff.  Just that AC policy. Yes. Okay. So that'll be there. But again, it doesn't fully solve the other one. It just... …allows us a little bit to know who made the change. So that's in 22? 22. Yeah. This is after it is…[unintelligible] So, we want to know what happened in the first place, what happened after it deployed it. I mention this 15 plus days [unintelligible] would be great, I was working directly… Yeah, 20 days. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So, 20…
14; ;01:05:02,425 --> 01:10:03,968; ;So right now, it shows 20 deploys, that's it. Doesn't matter if they're today or last week whatever It's your 20…you get. Troubleshooting initial attack where I can't put in this firewall because we're getting some sort of bug, and we need to know when was the last deployment. Well, I'm looking in here, and sure enough, somebody tried deploying it, like, 10 times in a row. That ate up my 20 last connec… Last deploys, so I couldn't see when it last deployed. Still can't deploy that box. Which one? [unintelligible] ... Working for months, and months, and months, and now it's stopped... When we hit… We saw… all in the book. Yeah, it doesn't match the log. Oh, so you guys called Tech? [unintelligible] We're not sure… So we already know it's coming. Destination FTPs. So, this was an interesting portion of our POV, Cisco and Checkpoint. Little score for Cisco and their own proprietary. But we know what's coming, so… One day. Yep. One day soon. So this an issue as well. Especially with my laptop, which is probably the most common resolution out there, 1024x768. You can only view four or five rules at a time. How much did you zoom in? Because when we zoom in 50%, we could see 16 bits. What's that? Zoom in. How much did you zoom out? Oh. Yeah, so I'm not… I'm sharing right now. So, if I go into one of our ACP policies… Now, what I would want to see here is more of an infinite scroll. Why… What's the page view? Why? It just complicates things, and you get confused as to where are the policies because of the way we have these folders. Well, this folder is 1 through 318. Yep. So now I'm still on page… Oh, no. Okay. So it got rid of all the pages there. But we have other folders within here where it kind of overlaps inbetween pages, and causes… It just makes it superconfusing to actually view what's going on. And right now… So, this is the default resolution. Right now, I'm… So this will be a regular old 100% zoom. I can see 5 rules of time. Did you… What I end up doing is zooming in, or zooming out to about 80%, and then I can see nine rules at a time. But still, we want… It's fine if it's the resolution on the laptop. On my normal monitor, I can see, what? Ten rules at a time. But give me an infinite scroll, don't add the pages, I guess will be my ask for you guys. But, yeah. Because that way, I can see all… Because I can't see all of my folders or sections on one page, unless I go through every single page, unexpand all of them, then I can see all my sections. That's just a lot of dead space on the top even though, too. See, because the view of this could use… A question. Typically, what is the rules… Number of rules? Uh, typically? Yeah. Well… Policies… ACEs? Or, like, CSMtype rules? Or decrypt together would be better? It depends. So, on a Firewall Pair, like I said, we're layered. Three layers, four. We don't really do Identity yet. We wanna do trustsec. We're working on a matrix of something, but I think InfoSec, or the engineer that we have assigned to our project is very ITcentric, and microflowcentric, so he wants us to define every single flow and create SGTs for every single miniapplication, and destination SGTs for all the destinations, and it's just getting very, very, very complex. We were hoping to have a policy that was very, very simple using SGTs, but I don't know if Security or InfoSec is willing to relax more and give us that flexibility to make our policy five rules instead of 700. This specific firewall, which is dedicated to Google Cloud, has 319 rules, anyany at the bottom. The anyany it hit 90% of the time, nobody requests access because the anyany is there. We have to rip that anyany out. This rule base is going to triple once we rip that anyany out. So, on average, maybe five to seven are rules. But we don't want to be there. We want to… We want to simplify our rule base. We just don't know how to get there. I don't know. We're trying to partner with InfoSec and build that framework, but I guess they don't have a drive to do that. We do, because we manage the policy sets. They just approve the firewall across, so what does it matter to them?
15; ;01:10:07,929 --> 01:15:00,243; ;So, the next one… Combine rules. So, if we have overlapping rules… I don't know if I really want this anymore. Wanted to understand this one. Make it a bit clear, like, what is the used case here? I can, now that, specially in targeting nextgen and noticing that each one of those is kind of specific threats, and maybe that… So thinking about the way that someone is gonna do it, if you have two rules… So, say, the source is 10, the next source, 172.26, or 172.60. Two separate rules going to the same destination over the same protocol, those end up being two separate ACEs on the firewall, but what CSM would do, would basically combine them all, get all of the matching ones, and then put them all in one rule. So, from the GUI's perspective, you have one rule, all in one view. Would it clean up our rule list? Yes, it would kind of… It would bring our rule number count down because it would combine the rules. We would just have to maintain separate descriptions, or at least a thorough description of all of the flows inbetween. I don't know. What were we talking about, guys?  Um, combining the rules. So…  I think [unintelligible]   You can write…  if you want to separate the rules, because if you want to add additional codes  or something, we have to again break the... For this combination we won't have to break that flow, and, like, add additional codes or something like that.  I don't know.  And if we have sections… If we have rules, subsections, specific applications or  order, or…  I mean, I think it depends on use cases and what kind of rules we're trying to combine. I mean, if the source is the only thing different, and the destination and services are the same, then why have two different rules? It's a [unintelligible] Maybe something like a warning, or something like when you add a rule,  that actually gives right… there's an...  overshadowing rule… [unintelligible] I think he's looking for something automatic, where it automatically adds those rules, but I think it is more of an enhancement than… I think it's a debatable enhancement, just for the fact that if you have individual sections that is just an abbreviation, and you want to combine rules, now you've got these two rules that were under independent application sections. Where are they gonna go? Into an application section? It doesn't make sense for second portion of that rule. So, having a physical separation of the rules makes it easier to interpret what each rule's for. If there's specific sources that we would group, we manually do it, I guess. I don't know. Basically, I don't think this needs to be a priority too I don't know. I don't even like [unintelligible] it anymore. I think especially now knowing the order of operations, and understanding the order of operations for snore too. Really and as we move away from ITbased rules and methodology, and choose what's important. Right, as you move to SUT or thread or risk, it would be nice if the tool gave some better feedback on the policy, right?  I think...  I think a lot of falls under that category of auditing the policy... Along with just saying that they are overshadowing, it would say, “Do you want to combine?” That's when you take a decision whether you want to put it together, yeah. If you say, “Combine,” then it merges into one. In TSA there was limitations on the number of, like, what piece that it could help. I don't know if the same applies for the… But even combined doesn't [unintelligible] modifications. But we don't know how they push the rules.  Oh, sure.  So… Yeah, we hit “Implement” all of the time on the ASAs. Yes it is. And again, it's our micro… You can't do subnettosubnet, even if it's PCIPCI, we have to do hosttohost on a lot of stuff, just because, you know… you got...  I mean...  You gotta figure out something.  for instance like that...  Its not available  That rule for...there is  Yeah there is, I just added I mean, if there is a rule 5 here, and then rule 319 is one of those that could be combined with rule 5… I mean, that whole…I mean, for that rule, it doesn't have to go through all those rules to get to 3...  319  I see what you're saying, yeah.  It might make things more efficient.  That's why... it makes the firewall more efficient by grouping. Of course there's a prefilter policy which you can apply if… To offload some of the… So, there's… I think there's value in it. And it just looks neat. I mean, that's more of it. I mean, it's not like…  Automatically group based on similar source  When... Or consistent destination services. I mean, Security Group Tag or the trusted model is based on the grouping of the objects. That's what it basically is. You define, “Oh, your desktops are these, your users are these, your servers are these, your PCI and all of this…”
16; ;01:15:00,307 --> 01:20:04,591; ;If we start doing it, won't it impact the order in which the rules are written in? Is it okay, or is a basic logic which we could use, or is it something at risk if we start doing that? I think of the order of rules is something we have to consider with that. Especially if we have… Key counts, then we just have [unintelligible] . What are the most used rules, you don't want that rules to be on the bottom of the list, you want that rule to be on the top of… The axisone rule policy, right? You don't want it to… so, it just depends how frequently that rule is used. [unintelligible] Just take your time, [unintelligible] We are gonna adjust priority, and then... Yeah, put “3” over there.  Yeah, I think that's the easiest thing…  Not really a “2”. If others are “2”, then that's a “3”. Definitely. And I think it's still debatable as to whether or not… I kind of see the value in it, but then again, I see it could cause issues. Say somewhere we didn't have the same scenarios of the… up the evaporation on the FTP too. Next one's easy. Right click an ACP rule for events. So, I wanna know… Show me all the traffic that's ever hit this rule. Simple as that. But that would imply that we have the events stored and we have some sort of loopback data. Unless that can open up a portal in the QRadar, or give you a string… The page to the Q radar, search query or a splunk string, I don't know. There's got to be a way to correlate it easily with the event. Within our QRadar logs right now, I don't know if we actually see the exact ACP policy or the rule number related to it.  If we do… It's not parsed, I know that.  It does. It's in the system. If... it does. There's definitely an SSR message. Which rule, which policy.  you talking about  I know it's in the [unintelligible]. I don't know if it's in QRadar events. So, if it's just taking everything it has in the connection and sending it off using the QRadar, then it should be there.  Okay.  Or, like, in the payload. It's in the payload. It's in the… Yeah. So, you just click into… Well, you wanna be able to search by that, though, right? Yeah, yeah. Give me an example, I'll see if I can pull it out. Okay. I think… I mean, we have the ability to add the payload as a column, and the payload is searchable. Yeah, but that's very expensive to search by. you... Like, resourcewise? Yes. If we can actually pull it out, I can make it indexable. And then you can actually search by ID. Okay. Oh, if you have cases like that, bring it to my attention, and I can see about pulling something out. Okay. Um, in most cases we've used the connection event, but as we add more firewalls, the connection events are becoming less useful. This is my issue. 1024x768. I don't know why your resolution is better than mine. [unintelligible] understood…yeah. I mean, I… I guess taking off of this piece, ignore that, and the ability to just kind of scroll through the entire thing, instead of paging through. So, what I was talking to them earlier was… So we have that auditing query feature, right? And the report generation from that is from a policy. If we can query that certain rule… And then it will create another… It will query and then create another box with a whole set of rules, giving us, “Okay, this flow keeps these rules. And any rule that you need services an application, this particular rule” So on and so forth, then that would help the most [unintelligible] I mean, what they were saying was, having the whole set of access control policy in that single line will only make the FMC probably slower because it's going back, querying all the… Okay. So, we have this nextgen firewall. The reason we have 3 of these lines is because we're doing things in a legacygeneration way. We're doing everything ITbased, /32 to /32. If there's a way you guys can help us sell something else to our InfoSec team, or if there's a way we can get it down. So we have less than 48 rules, so I can see it all in one page. I mean, I think that's great, but we don't have that [unintelligible], and we have a process. We have… We don't know how to get to nextgen with our current security processes. I mean, [unintelligible]. It's a journey. It's a lack of understanding on their behalf, it's a lack of understanding on our behalf, it's… What are other customers doing? I mean, we've asked for rulebased examples from other customers that are using applicationcentric business, risk applications, and more of the nextgen stuff, where they might have a firewall with 10 rules on it. But everyone we've looked at, felt they all are IPbased and…
17; ;01:20:05,585 --> 01:25:06,305; ;Or they've had to hide most of their policy work where we can't what it was before getting it to them. The understanding how we can get there, having some sort of… If we're using all Cisco technologies and trust sectors there has some sort of migrational systems and maybe it's an advanced or an advisory service we get, just trying to get help us in negotiate using some of these nextgen features. Because we have to be able to interpret and understand exactly how they work. And I think that the gap here is our InfoSec team doesn't understand it, because we can't convey them because I don't think we a 100% know in a lot of cases. Sure. Some typical services… [unintelligible] But this policy on this firewall that I've been trying those 316 rules, it's just unmanageable. There's absolutely no way you can load this policy and try to get a whole listed view of what it does. They're too long, there's too many pages… 10,000 rules. It's much, much worse. Do you have trust words with 10,000 rules but then they are ASCII? Why are they even using FTD? Just to get a couple of application rules in there? You don't see a lot of people just inherently using just business risk or just business critical, or… Okay. So, it's always a combination. There you are. Just one of the reasons. There's software, right? ASA software download… Slowly, it will fade away, right? I think there's a workaround for that. Operating 9.8. Yes, that's what they are saying. So, 9.7 is just gone? It's not ASA platform. Well, I mean, like… I'm saying, like, ASA is slowly fading out. It's implying that… The whole FTD… So, that's fine, if it's all is synchronization, I don't think we need to go there. You guys know… So, this one's good. In a lot of cases, we don't have the same licensing across the board. So, I want to create a new policy that contains all of the rules. I want to be able to copy that policy and paste it. And then I want to disable whatever features, in that policy that don't match my licensing. We just walk through a demo, maybe… [unintelligible] Copy. Copy. You can see you can copy the tip off, or some chipboard… Give me the ability to copy it into itself. In a few scenarios here, not… Okay, so, we have a couple of different scenarios that I want to point out here. I want to be able to highlight all this and say, ‘Okay, application team, here is your application,” Control+C, open up Excel, Control+V. Can't. If there is an export button, probably… Um… Have you seen the export? Well, no. An export… Okay. So, there is an export. But that export's not the one. Okay. If there was an export… Would that be sufficient? Yes. I mean, the ability to just copy and paste would be awesome, too. But then, once you export, then you make certain changes or remove certain things. You will also need the ability to import it back in some manner. Right? Otherwise, what… What's the point? Because of the auditings. Auditing, I understand, but if you had to copy with stripping out certain… certain... If you don't have license on that device, right? So, you might want to have the ability to import as well, in some cases. So, I want to be able to dump the rule base for somebody in a legible format. That's not a 175 PDF pages with one rule per PDF. So, the way you guys display that today isn't feasible unless you've only got four or five rules. So, what we end up getting is too many pages. So, what I want to do is copy and paste this in Excel… Something…Just to give them something. Export to Excel. CSP, that would be fine as well. Um, a PDF that's more of a view like this, where it's actually legible instead of single pages per rule, that'd be great, too. Just something that'll be a little report on what rules are there, to be able to give to the teams [unintelligible]. Is it okay if it's just object needs? [unintelligible] That's fine. I mean, we have the same problem with CSM. We always end up doing a key of a dump, or object contents, and it's kind of a pain to do that. I mean, actually go to the rules, but I understand it's probably not gonna be something easy. Something like copy and paste out of here would… I would think would be easier. Now, taking this one step further, we want to be able to copy this out into Excel. Now, I also want to say, you know what, all of my policies, if I start fresh, I am probably going to start with these first few rules, eventually, these will hopefully be blocks instead of monitor.
18; ;01:25:06,705 --> 01:30:01,025; ;But I want to… I want to copy these. I want to paste them in… I want to paste them into a new ACP policy, or an existing ACP policy. Why not use an [unintelligible] for that instead, where you just have a base policy with those four rules? And then all other ones, which you said [unintelligible]. These four rules require specific licensing. Not just these specific rules, any specific rules. It could be fine, get… to default all of these. Whatever you choose. Whatever your team needs. You choose which base policy… Right.  Can't have multiple…  Okay. I feel we should understand a little bit more about the inheritance piece of it. It's pretty quick. We can sort it out right, 2 seconds. When we have policy inheritance… Well, actually creating… So, I'll show you. This is what we have now. We have got a StoreGlobalpolicy, which is basically protocols that we… And services that we say, “Hey, let's go with this everywhere internal,” and then we have got our individual StoreOn… policy that's actually, like, specific to the store. Like, specific to…  like you said before, if you just copy those four rules into some base policy that is… You cannot copy, so you have to…  You have to make…  Yeah, yeah, make a full…right, four rules and… And all the policies  that you need with the rules as the base policy. Then you'll automatically get those four rules. If you have to make a change to those four rules, then you can do it in one place, instead of everywhere… Like, X number of policies you copy… I'm just trying to think, like… When they get the inheritance piece, how will the inheritance solve our problem? Are you guys following? You are? More like these guys.  You guys following? Show but one rule. Okay, so we get this scenario recently where we have this facility… Nothing, turned off. It might have powered down, the TV. Oh, the power. Oh, yeah, maybe… When you did this, I think it went off. Turned off. So, we have a scenario where we deployed a firewall pair, which is going to be for our secondary ECX Cloud Exchange that has to contain the exact same policy. Well, here is our policy right here… It's this one. It's CH2 Access Control. I couldn't assign this to the box, because for some reason, we didn't have the licensing right, and we needed the firewall off that day. So I copied and pasted this, and then I was hoping I can go  and disable the DNS license…  I got you. After you copy and paste, you cannot disable the DNS license  I guess. Yeah, so, I think those are scenarios where I want to take rules from policies, just copy ‘em in the RAM,  and be able to paste them wherever the hell I want, Excel or a different ACP policy. I see value in that more used cases than just what I am coming up with right now. So just being able to easily copy rules back and forth between ACP policies… I mean, the only reason… Quickly do… just to copy a whole policy and then delete stuff,  which is a great…  Okay, I like that logic. Let's do that. So, I have got this firewall right here. And you'll show me how to do this. So I want this policy on a specific firewall, so, what I'm gonna do here is say, right click, copy it. And then run AMS. Whatever or something. So, now I have got this policy. I want to assign it to a specific device. And it already has a policy assigned. That's fine. [unintelligible] Okay. So, I run into this error. Now, this error basically says… That's the specific error I want. Sorry for the dramatic effect, that was not... I could say it, right? Now, I want it to play… It's gonna give me this warning. Now, this warning says, “The policy that requires THREAT license… I do not have a THREAT license. Now, this specific rule for URL. Oh, I have a solve for that, too, by the way. Finish the EOA. Yes. But that's not even… I get past that. The Security tells me DNS. So, I get past that piece, It's ready to deploy and then I go on Security Intelligence. You see this thing here? One of the target devices… Default DNS. No. THREAT license, because of the default DNS policy. So I want to unassign this default DNS policy. How do I do that?
19; ;01:30:03,111 --> 01:35:03,302; ;Go to the… Exactly. So, copy and pasting this would not work for this environment. I had to build a brandnew one from scratch, with no DNS policy. So, what I ended up doing was creating a DNSblank test policy. Now, this did not work because it still requires license, regardless if it's blank or not. So… Oh, no, this is the default one. What I ended up doing was disabling the DNS rules in trying to apply that. That still didn't work. This might be a bug. Yeah. This just might be some issue where there's supposed to be a "none" option here, for the DNS policy. But there isn't one. Yeah. So for that specific scenario, if I were able to copy and paste the global rules out into a brandnew policy, I wouldn't have had to start from scratch and code 300some rules. Yeah, it doesn't work. I didn't write a code here… So, yes… copy ACEs, ACLs, whatever out of one ACP to another ACP. So I'm just breaking it up further. We already went through it. Copy into Excel, copy from one ACP to another ACP. [unintelligible] …with an ACP policy. So, yeah. And I think if I point there, indicating that the adjustment of the columns constantly is 100% necessary… So if you are going page to page, and you're looking at specific rules here, certain things that we're not using right now, like destinations on the security zones, get rid of those. All I want to see is my source network, my destination network, my applications, my service URL, and that's it. Like, stuff I'm actually using. So, right click, remove, something like that. So, you want to save the three of these? The last [unintelligible] Yeah, most definitely. Is it across, or is it only per policy? I mean, why not across? It depends. No, I mean, based on your description, that's what I was… Say, for example, you don't have… You are applying this policy to a device which does not have application license for it. So, you remove application column. Yep. But when you go to other policy, it has application license, it has rules, and you don't want that to be there, right? Yeah, maybe in the last saved column, an indicator saying you're hiding columns or something. I mean… I guess I don't really care, as long as it has the ability to add and delete the columns, to add or remove them. I don't really care if it saves. It would be nicer to save. I could see that being problems for you, like you said. On a specific box, you don't see the application column when there might be application rules. …he says that, yeah, yeah, yeah. But you need to know also that there are risks. Because to remove that column, that you might not… [unintelligible] it could work. If there are certain rules, we could prompt, saying that you are not viewing a column, but it has certain rules.  Certain rules.  Yeah. Yeah. We can work with that. [unintelligible] yeah. I just remember going through, and trying to understand the different policy, and constantly having to expand and… And then as you click the next page, I believe it resets your expand and… [unintelligible] It was really, really annoying to go through. Select these objects. I just want to see the entire network, the source destination. Definitely. I want to see the entire service. I'd also want to see… And this is not our list. Maybe this is something that we should capture, at least internally, is I want to see the description of the rules in the rulebook. I don't want to have to click here. I know why this is here, because you have multiple comment entries. Just the last one there. Yeah, yeah, the last comment will be good to have in there. I don't know. What do you guys think about that? Yeah. I think that's nice. Yeah. But thinking about it, why would you even have 50 comments in a single rulebook? What is the logic? Why is there the ability to add infinite amount of comments per rule? Why not just one comment you can edit? Yeah. So, if we click a rule, and we go to comments… So I've got no comments. I want to do a test. I mean, I think it was really hard… See… You see there's one now, and now I want to edit this… Can't edit comments. So I add a new comment. I think that was the way for them to do the… Change something.
20; ;01:35:03,950 --> 01:40:03,990; ;Somebody adding another port or something.  If you add a ticket there, we can refer to your ticket, go back to… I saw an “Edit” icon next to the… It's only there till you save it. Until you save…Hold on. So, that's weird. It actually got rid of my old… Oh, because I didn't save it. Okay, so now I've got one comment. It should say “pride”. I'm gonna add a new comment, and say “test”. Saved. And now this should increment to two columns. Yeah. I don't get the need to ever have more than two comments per rule. Even if you have multiple comments, I prefer a character than an individual entity. I don't know if there's logic behind any of that, if that's a reason. It's already there. What you want is to be able to view the comment, right? Yep. It'd just be nice to be able to view comment, edit a rule, and make that field searchable. So, like I added “pride” in the comments, it does not come up. Or there's 150… [unintelligible] It doesn't search that. So, it would be nice to be able to search for comments, so if I have got a specific change number, I want to know where is that rule that correlates to that change. How would I find it? There's no way to search it. And maybe that's a query field, a field in the query that we want to get into. If we could've done this… I thought we did this, and it's just… I am not sure whether… I think Mohan did this one. This specific one is… I mean, this goes back to audit who made the change. I think this was our solution, to try to see… To extract the data, who made the theme. One of the reason is, I don't think we get the historical changed data, who made what changes in that policy, so we are trying to pull the information and save it in some file, I guess. Yeah, but obviously, API works only like what they expose on their data model, right?  So, it's not…  same limitation. Yeah, same limitation whether it's a GUI or... Understand the problem, right? Any way of getting after the API will be, I think… [unintelligible] So… Multiple administrators make changes to policies, so I think the idea here is, two people are editing the same ACP policy. [unintelligible] Hold on, here. I don't see how this would have worked. I am on your side, but that's what. I don't know about that, if that… What that one is for. I don't know. Multiple administrators. I'm gonna look at our gap analysis, because our gap analysis was a lot more clear and detailed. I just want to say like, when someone is editing a policy, it needs to be locked. Yeah, and that's what it is. That's how CSM works, that's how any of the tools we've looked at would work. No, I mean, you want to lock the whole policy? The ACP policy that you're ending, yeah. No, I mean if you are doing, like, access control policy, and maybe CH2 is the most used access control policy…  So, two people at the same time…  Yeah. how would that work? [unintelligible] Your screen would have to adjust. I mean, you'd be looking at, like,  really tiny change to theirs  I guess You have some kind of a status phase where it is constantly says, “Look, there are two people making changes in this policy.” I don't know. [unintelligible] I don't know if it'll ever work. They weren't able to do that with... I don't know. I mean, I am not sure if I put that in or not, but that… [unintelligible] So, thinking about it from policy inheritance perspective, if I'm making a change to a policy that's inherited from a global, I should be able to make that change without locking up the global, and vice versa. Is that there yet?  Yeah. So, at the very least, I want that, but… I mean, I think it would be nice, considering how big our policies are, and the amount of work. We have one guy doing GSP changes. He has literally dedicated eight hours a day to coding firewall rules in FMC. He hates this product because of it. It's very painful for him, but it prevents anyone else from going in there to make changes as well. Yeah, I mean, right now, the multitier firewall, the net services firewalls are the most used, you know, policies out there. So whenever someone is making the changes, until and unless that activity is submitted and approved in CSM, we cannot go and make any additional changes is our policy. But I mean, in this case, you don't really have to submit and approve your activity.
21; ;01:40:04,034 --> 01:45:01,346; ;You just have to save it and you have to exit out and somebody else can go and make changes. So you don't have that, I mean complexities here to make. So not really needed. [unintelligible] just to make changes. [unintelligible] Multiple administrators, can you see this? No, We don't want to do it with that one. We want to.... I just don't know how possible that's going to be. Well, it's a story to write so that we... [unintelligible] You can have multiple activities and every revision in the policies is locked to that research specific. And you can rule that revision that certain uses are made. Yes. So that's why we have multiple activities in the same policy. Maybe they can't work in the same rule at the same time, but, you know, any other rule. Okay. We'll leave it. We're going to have policies like you said, we have firewalls that are always locked by somebody within the CSM department. It's a huge pain for us and you've mentioned this will be on the CSM side. We have 25 requests being queried every day.  It's not going to be assigned to the same engineer.  Yeah It's not practical either. So if... I mean and... There will always be some positions that are more used than the other firewalls. Our store policies are mostly static and I don't know how it will change when we'll deploy these nextgeneration fireworks? How frequently we will make the change? But the policies that we are looking at and I know that at any given time, if someone is not making, it will just be one person who will be making change and that somebody will be in the line waiting for that change to come. So. I mean having ability to multiple users work on the same policies but we may restrict them at a rule level trying to... Yeah. Not any individual will make or two individuals will not make change to the same rule. Yeah. It gets tricky with the other tabs as well, like SI, advanced off those [unintelligible] [unintelligible]  Common request you see?  Yeah. Okay. We used to have it so that it went together anytime and that's what it was like the worst case scenario. That's what we have to say. This is not our biggest priority but I know that in the long run, when we use this firewalls more and more, I don't know how we are going to streamline the process of being IP and must we can, going UPS and all that. If we cannot achieve that end, if we get that same 25 requests of being coded each and every day and then I know that you know you will have some.  "Oh! Look, you are making changes, I have to create".  Yeah We have that all day today and if some of these features don't get addressed like the object machine so just drop the subscription there or let their employee without any track. Some rules, like I said, could be twentythree minutes, and that's working at a fast pace trying to get a single rule. Our requests aren't single rules and it could take someone like 45 hours to get a request done and stay up to date? Because there is no query in the database either, right. I don't think when project managers are asking them to create good firewall rules. They are going to use that Search button to see whether that individual host has started off the network which allows that whole access or not. And I know that we can go ahead and look at that auditing feature and still history has sonars, that they don't hear about that auditing feature either. Right? They don't' care about the overshadowed rules of consolidated, unless if [unintelligible] if you add it that rule, you can save it with checkpoint or something.  You have an option  Oh yeah! [unintelligible]
22; ;01:45:01,401 --> 01:50:01,543; ;No. I know. I mean why didn't even you have to add to the rules. What would have been really valued adding a duplicate rule? Fine, give me an example, why don't you let me into role? I like the fact that it tells you it's duplicate, but everyone is just going in there and deleting the rule. I mean why does it even allow you to add a duplicate rule? When will there ever be values to having 2 exactly having same rules? If they have the exact security zones, service destination, whatever, I mean it doesn't make sense. One time, it might happen is when there is an overly permissive rule, you are adding in this permissive granular rule, you know, not the same exact over this permissive rule. That's the only thing. Yeah. A duplicate. Definitely at why you even like that. [unintelligible] So what happens around the scheduling from the jobs, I didn't add this entry in there, I thought the scheduling of jobs was fine. What sort of enhancements are we looking for? I don't know, [unintelligible] get the job? And wasn't it earlier when we were talking about it, I think we solved that [unintelligible] to catch the schedules. I think the idea was, you know, right you can only select devices and assign them to a group and deploy a group, but back up. Oh, oh yeah. AX walked us through a way of creating a group and deploying to a group. So we are thinking from a store level how could automatically deploy all these boxes without checking a box every time and say: [unintelligible] You just specify the store group and make sure the device view gets into that group.  So I think we saw all that of now.  Yeah Yeah. Yeah. That was for... we were trying to... we have a couple of firewalls and we have to selective use of firewalls. You know when I wish I was doing a better job of reviewing some of these three. Yeah. So, we have gone through this one. It seems like there is a lot to duplicates on your sheet there. That's the duplicate, yes, seems it [unintelligible]  This is a good one.  So the ability to do some captors on both units from FMC at the same time, not separate captors. What you need some..... So walk through that.  If you guys aren't familiar.   From CLA or we'll start from that. Yeah. See the cluster exact capture. It's not possible in the backups. But, you basically, so say, this specific pair of firewalls right here, we want a troubleshoot option here. To say, capture, otherwise, we at the individual activity troubleshoot options, when we click on it and then you can capture on the individual. Nine times out of ten, ten times out of ten, you're going to do the same capture on both. So either the ability to copy that capture field and paste it in the other one or make it simple and just add a cluster troubleshooting here. Don't do clustering in a single management [unintelligible]. Doesn't make sense to me actually. Yeah, yeah. I don't get why it was like that. So for standby, sure because there is no, I don't know. You don't need to just to understand  where you actually.  Oh yeah. I know, but, why not just have a troubleshoot button up here? And that's it and when you click the troubleshoot and then it shows you the clusters device was so no matter what you get here, you could [unintelligible] on before boxes, or you have options to stick to clusters. I think there are different ways to take this. We can add another troubleshooting button on that cluster. So you can capture and the troubleshooting from a cluster perspective. Similar to everything you would do as a cluster exec command. So a cluster exec show can, I mean, that's another reason to go to the CLI is for the connection table. That's not something that's displayed here. You can have that command line. So command [unintelligible] Yeah very very limited shell command.  Other to [unintelligible]  So you can add like that. I don't know what. I don't really use this often. It's terrible. Yes. It doesn't show you in action. Connection detail, like that? Show conn, it should give you the connection. Yeah There's no cluster. Cluster exactly may I comment here. That's what the individual. Maybe there's no connection which will help this. Oh. There's 10 in UNIX. [unintelligible] So yeah I think there are reasons. Honestly I haven't played around this one because I am CLI first myself and I'd rather just go to CLI; and those commands that I run are from the cluster exec perspective. I don't want to look at the connection. I don't want a have two console sessions open and constantly have to run the same commands on both. I just log in to one cluster, check and that's all. Cluster section captures your all captures.
23; ;01:50:03,186 --> 01:52:57,873; ;Yeah and you can go to the CLI, you won't know, you've made that thing and you are not using it.  [unintelligible]  Capture?  Yeah.  Oh yeah! You don't want that. You have to restrict that to maybe only a few person until they fix it as long as you have FTD or [unintelligible] I mean [unintelligible] were some indepth [unintelligible]. You may have to give a disable expert mode in FTP. Yeah. [unintelligible] So this was on same settings around that really get copied at the same time  [unintelligible]  Yeah. I think we've covered it. So you may be able to use groups... the same thing from here. So I think it hits the list, I mean there is a lot of information. So I've get one additional one that we didn't cover, I guess that's on our list. Maybe just use the talking points that weren't on your list. But a lot of these tasks. So within FMCA if we look at even the deploys. So I look at deployments, right. What is this? How long the deployment took? That's how long. No. I know I just saw it and never seen that before. [unintelligible] So that's how long the job took. [unintelligible] This is really exciting. I've never seen that before. I have never seen that before. What is missing there is one minute 45 seconds ago scheduler. It's not a node. You guys are [unintelligible] that wrong. That's... No. How long the job ran? It was in 07/11/17. So our problem has been when this job run? When? When? And like hovering over anywhere except that sign doesn't give you that.  I have no idea that was there.  [unintelligible] you were already there.  Yeah I know, I know. Woohoo. You [unintelligible] bro. Well, let's actually look on the other tab. Happy hour. Finally, we left on a good note. You did it! Is this of [unintelligible] Okay, some of these like four channel [unintelligible], not receiving any packet. [unintelligible] is the face we have individual subinterface is fine. Is there any way on the help monitor section? I just disabled this, so I keep quit this alert every single day saying my port channels are... [unintelligible] We've done that, I just wasn't sure if there's something else. No, it's simple and getting granular, what you can practice. And I don't really care about the timestamps here and[unintelligible]. Now this... Oh crazy! Haven't we [unintelligible] As you learn the tool more, you will...  You know why?
1; ;00:00:02,080 --> 00:05:10,666; ;Take 3. Thank you guys. So yeah I think I'm going to open it up now if you guys have feedback on FMC, CSM, ASE, FTD. Whichever it is, you can pick and just go one by one  So, let me... I can give you some honest feedback. I feel that this product is very early in its life cycle and now we are suffering a lot of pain because of it. You know a lot of upgrades, every time we turned around we needed a new upgrade, we have to identify the cog, which means we have to go above something that we already have and... I am a little concerned about the product maturity at this point. Alright. And you know some of the features sets where we have to... I can't remember...on exactly what you call that but within the FMC where you have to basically use that workaround built in to the FMC because the feature is not there yet. Hans, do you remember the name of that, like where we had to build Flex [unintelligible]? [Unintelligible]  Yeah, [unintelligible], yep. So I'm just concerned about product maturity and the fact that we're rolling it out into an enterprise environment. A little young.
True. Thank you. And yes I would like a candid feedback so I'm not going to be offended by anything you said, so it's perfectly fine to tell me whatever you think is a [unintelligible]. So just, I guess, the cosmetic part. I know you guys, I believe, are planing a reporter for FTD? Like a separate reporter applies this, cause I've got to admit, the reporting function [unintelligible] and the tool itself is rough. My biggest concerns are: basically adding or removing columns from this and being able to extend columns or move columns around. So in other words, you know, I can remove a column and sort of add it but I can't slide the placement, so it's a cosmetic thing but... You know sometimes I don't need all this data in the front. Like zones, I can't just wipe that out and move stuff over left, right. You know, almost, I guess a slightly good example if I showed you was... I just show you... Basically what I'm talking about so Iris has a pretty much straight functionality of column management and column order. I don't know if you guys want to steal it necessarily but you know. So I mean you pick different columns and then slide the order up and down. Right.  So you can basically make that kind of table how you want it. You see what I'm saying? And instead of having to export it into a CSV and manipulate everything in a CSV. But I'll admit if you guys have a new reporting tool out, hopefully this new functionality will be in that reporting tool. The other portion I have, or basically what we have is, I'm sure you're aware of the all the different databases within your actual tool. You know like IDS is separated from the SA logs, the connection logs are different, they come out in different interface and port, which we worked through and isn't that large of a scale problem The slight problem that I guess have is you guys create custom parcers for RSA, secure works or anything else for any kind of sims due to the fact of, this is standard or say a dump our connectionwise. The problem that we had is you guys don't use blank field placeholders. So in other words, you have each field in between, I guess parenthesis, but... If say like a client, like you see everything is sort of in an alignment, and then if a client application doesn't exist everything starts of sliding left. And it becomes hard to parse because basically if a client application doesn't exist, instead of saying unknown, or NA, or just a space, you slide everything left. Which means every parse blown out that I know about [unintelligible]. Our RSA can't even intake this at the moment. It's partly intake but there is a lot of missalignment. And then, you have the airplugs, and the snortlogs, and all these, and then how you... if they're all coming from a single IP then it's like what logs are which? The AMP for endpoint integration with the FMC does seem to function and work for showing the IOCs and other events I guess you would say for AMP point? Which would like to also pursuing for endpoint. However those logs don't forward out in the same CIS log. Which we were having issues with. So in other words, you could see them in the event we were in FMC you see AMP for endpoint in the areas that are compromised, scan completed like this. But it doesn't actually forward out in the log stream so if you could put into the seam with the rest of the [unintelligible] Which I'll admit, yeah, we are working with an API that pull down the cloud events but it's just something that, here you can see an event viewer but it's not in the fire power log, so now you have to go to another Cisco product.
2; ;00:05:10,660 --> 00:10:01,680; ;Overall, one of my concern was... I guess you guys have... I know you use RedCloud webroot for he URL filtering portion. Then you have the security intelligence list, which there is really no way to see. So you have a URL checktool that shows you the break cloud reputation, it doesn't show you if it's in a security intelligence list or not. So it's hard to know what those security intelligence list will block. So whether or not we would deploy them is slightly complicated than no. That's not the one I wanted. You guys have so many sites and to be honest you have Talos, which is separate than break cloud, which is separate than open DNS, Umbrella and even URL guy have a little difficulty tracking all that stuff. But I did have a partial question. Down here you seem to have a lookup tool that's the next gen fire power/fire power services and this category doesn't seem to be driven by break cloud. So I don't even where that plays into the fact. I don't even know... that doesn't seem to be break cloud, I don't know if that's security intelligence, it's like you seem to have whole another category. I guess what I would say is, alignment with all these Cisco products in with Talos and kind of having one source to say: this website will be blocked or no blocked. Cause right now, if we have a malware site, say a ransomware website, it's hard to say: Hey.... You know, security or somebody might ask me, intelligence say: Is this website locked? And I've got to look in 7 different places to figure out if Meraki, Firepower, security intelligence, all these different things in the event viewer: is it blocked, is it where, the policy trait still doesn't work a 100%. It's hard to say: Yes, this will be blocked across DHA or we need to add manually to a black list. That becomes an operational nightmare. That would be...  And this is it for every site that you going to.... I mean every... I mean literally anything if we ever say, hey, we want to block... You know, we get through our feeds from... Now I know you guys are making... I forgot what it's called. Cisco intelligence center where the optics, and tax feeds, and threat feeds coming into a single device that will hopefully, I'm guessing, propagate across open DNS fire power Meraki but I'm guessing it's all going to be fire power at the beginning. I would love a single source where I can put a single... I mean, we're building API lists. To do all these stuff with automation, to keep one black list.. I would love more than that You know I could either submit or lookout a website... go to basically an iron port website... you know, the Talos website, sort of? I always get them confused even, you can see I'm already confused. The Cinder based website, which is now Talos intelligence... So just say, you know: what is the category of my website, what's the reputation health? I see you guys you have a list that shows if it is blacklisted or not. But it doesn't line up across all the tools. Like I would rather, you know, either a central site like Talos, I'm guessing it's going to be where it tells me... it's good across all the different devices or what these categories are. And then if I submitted to them and say: Hey, that looks like ransomware. It propagates all the tools. Cause mind you, we even have the CT functionality and the current AMP for endpoints. Which we have our blue cold logs going into a generated events however the firepower because the logs are so different don't even play into your own device and that... I mean... That's hard to say, I mean even to my management I have to tell them basically CTA is going away. So as we phase out the Blue cost for fire powers we are basically losing that functionality. Got it. Ok. And just even in that alignment, you know, you look in CTA it tells you it's malware and then you look in RedCloud or something else or Umbrella and it's like: No, it's neutral, a benign site. You're like, one of these is wrong. It's just that real centralized management, I mean I know I mentioned this to some of the higher Cisco guys. It really needs to be... rapid. I think that's probably the most rapid changes needed; centralizing your intelligence... really getting I mean.... At least lining you up in some type of way where you can say: This is blocked across all these platforms, or not blocked across all these platforms, or you know, it's malicious across all the platforms, its health... You know file storage sharing, however you guys do it, it's bad reputation/good reputation, but it just doesn't seam like Talos intell.... They all line up differently. [Unintelligible] I don't know if I have... Yeah and basically the CTA part, the fact that it doesn't record all the HTP gets and pushes in that single TCP...
3; ;00:10:01,680 --> 00:15:06,660; ;Sorry who doesn't record? So, FTB records either the beginning of a connection or the end of a connection, it doesn't record all the get requests. Which is why the CTA I guess doesn't function because it's not a proxy. It doesn't record all the individual requests only the last request. Right. So, I mean, that's actually a gigantic security gap we have currently. Placeholders... I've got to admit the way the logs come from all different IPs is just... That took us a lot of time to work it through. But I mean I could see that where a single reporting tool will help with that, the single server intelligence system may help with propagating, or blacklist, or threat feeds, you know... Bulk loading of URLs, so that was what I was going to say, like Fishhouse or spam, or threat, or threat grid; somebody gives us a list... FBI even gives us a list of 200 websites sometimes. And then it's like okay, blacklist all these websites. Now how do I do that? You'll have a bulk load necessarily, I know at least in that other portal... you could load multiple URLs at once, which is good, but it doesn't propagate against all, you know, all the tools. Those are probably, I guess you could say, security technology operational. Questions of that kind of centralized policy push, I know we attempted to make within our actual policy, I guess you have a threat feed option to pull URLs from a text list. Yeah, like technically a threat feed list. to be able to pull from an object that pulls updates from a text file on a server, and I guess eventually that will become a threat feed, but we're trying to use some of that functionality to control our blacklist. Did you try that again, now? I have not tested that, again with the lab in its current state you know... Yeah, you were going to get another server. I did get... so our network [unintelligible] security automation tool, we have a phantom tool which does our automation that has integrated with Umbrella, so I actually have a blacklist that... can be pushed out and up into the Umbrella API. I don't know if Meraki has one that wasn't a Meraki phantom connector yet, but there is an ASR, ISR, and ASA connectors; there's not a Firepower connector yet. Native built into the tool, but really working with other vendors because I'll admit we're mostly a Cisco shop. We're mostly a Cisco network shop at this moment, but as I said even Meraki, which is technically a Cisco project, but yet is a different stream. And Umbrella is a different stream, they don't even integrate. So you can say "hey we're a Cisco shop", and they're still not integrated. So you know that's a big problem; nevermind our legacy tools, our other tools, other portals; things integrating together has become almost worse than it was. I understand what you're saying. When we're with a single vendor now. As I said, I haven't driven into the, I guess you would say, this host table stuff, and like the sock functionality of this; our sock isn't even drilled into this with host mapping or... Where am I even going, is it hosts? Where's the 14 or 04, where is that? I forget what it's called. Oh like the threat level? To be honest I don't even know. Isn't that on their application? I get lost with this device myself to be honest. I'm still trying to understand what is it the 14 thing is related to. There's a 04, I believe it might be intrusions, it might be on the intrusion tables. And this date/time thing, this time thing could use an improvement. Whether it's paused, like the pause and not paused is weird; you figure if it's unpaused it should be live streaming and then when you pause it it should freeze. It doesn't seem to function like that, impact files. Yeah, and we haven't drilled into, I mean I've looked at breakset 50 where he gets into the indicator compromises and kind of how to do this. We haven't moved our sock to that type of operation. So they're still very eventdriven, but not mapped to have you guys map OS fingerprinting... or ability fingerprinting to the host table [unintelligible]. I'll admit the vulnerability mapping is a little rough due to the fact that I guess you guys fingerprint a Windows 2003 server. And then you just list all of the potential vulnerabilities for that server and then the [unintelligible] for that trip.
4; ;00:15:06,660 --> 00:20:02,500; ;Not saying whether or not it was compromised or not compromised; so in other words you can see a [unintellible] signature was blocked, so technically it was blocked... meaning, you know, was the server even compromised? So if it's an inbound request in that DMZ that attack never even reaches the server; so how much do I care about that impact? And you know you have the [unintelligible] signatures are I guess more like command and control, so you can say "this guy is compromised". Now I don't know how well that maps out, but it seems like there's a little bit of loss; and then that inbound signature says "well you know, it's a 2003 server, it may have this list of vulnerabilities... but we don't know if those vulnerabilities are patched or not. And that's where it get a little hazy... I guess people get confused of what some of it means, and it gets a little bit the break set training set classes we've seen, but do you guys have... training classes for a sock, or a training program, to say this is how we expect you guys to work in the portal. how to look at it, what you'd think a sock should do, see what I'm saying? Instead of me training them on how this tool should function. Like I don't want to write my whole own training class to train our sock on how impact flags and all these things work. Like I talk to them about it but they all seem completely lost, because again they work from just "hey we see an IBS signature file... we do XYZ, but we see this specific signature file and we do that. You guys are, I mean I like the way you guys line it up, but it's just a new way to look at things for a sock. And I just don't think we have the knowledge of it; I don't know what trainings are available or can be pushed into our overall ELA or anything like that. It's definitely going to become different for how we work. Yeah, I don't have an answer for the trainings, I guess... Yeah, as our customer success manager we've had some troubleshooting training things, but just that overall... if there's an actual sock...Like this is how we expect you guys to maybe look at reports, this is how you would look at things... I mean the Cisco Prime things did a good job, not just sending somebody a half hour or 45 minute video... and go "read through the slide [unintelligible] and learn how to use Firepower" is a little rougher than... an actual just a few minute class, an instructional class even more; even if it's just a Youtube series... 1,2,3 like beginning, into... Well like I know you guys have the Cisco training website that has some of the decks and just some that kind of like beginner, second... Yeah well they have a Youtube channel. Yeah, that too. Yeah, that's a fair point. I know it might be out there. Yeah so the question on the training actually [unintelligible] also asked me if for her guys there was a file power thing available... We reached out to the Firepower instructor that we have over here that actually gave a Firepower course and mentioned that there was no available [unintelligible]...some kind of custom training and he was able to deliver it. Probably that will be the training to take or to look at. Unless the Cisco guys really come up with something other that [unintelligible] portfolio; Firepower at this point was not delivering them... Well if you've got [unintelligible], I could probably keep talking... [unintelligible] And no feedback is too small, so if you've guys have got something that's very specific to a page, like you mentioned the columns that's fine. Yeah, and to be honest, I noticed even in the guide I don't know...Hans is really all the different services. Every time we go to troubleshoot, we're getting this CLI, we're restarting individual services and what they all do. It just doesn't seem to be listed out yet, well out in the public or someplace. I think that's part of this is a new product. With the ASA there's a wealth of resources. We can type "ASA how do I do that?" and you're going to get 100 different websites. 50% are Cisco, but the other 50% you're reading about how other people explain it. And there's not that wealth of knowledge on the web for this product by any means. But in terms of the...I noticed from the few cases that the team has opened you started building like "oh I know I have to click and generate troubleshooting files...
5; ;00:20:02,500 --> 00:25:00,840; ;And post it somewhere intact of whatever sites. I told you we participated in the beta... It should be something better, a [unintelligible] Well in other words in autoload, I know some other tools have the thing where it just autoloads directly to a tag case. Like bluecoat has this sort of button where you literally put in the code number and it updates automatically. Well that too, but I'm talking more about the [unintelligible] analysis to say "listen, I'm running troubleshoot problems, hit this button... you run your own self checkin, right. So like check the... Everything and verify every single service, process that's run, etcetera, because again we run into the [unintelligible], for example say you... upgrade an HA pair you're supposed to break. And so well you know that I'm an HA pair, why don't you just check yourself? Cause I have now disabled yourself, [unintelligible] and why do I have to do it? It's very simple to use a program into the tool, all these things that I checked for. And so before I even contact...well I mean you can start the service yourself, and I don't even have to open it. Okay, because all he's going to tell me is "this service didn't start, do it yourself". I say well do it yourself; it's supposed to be nextgeneration firewall so I shouldn't be going through much pain to troubleshoot this. Also more feedback during the policy update process. Like we understand that at some point during the policy update process we all take a brief interruption to service depending on what we're doing. A message that says "okay now your interruption of service is starting; now it's over", instead of having 6 minutes and 30 seconds of policies just churning and churning. There's not very much feedback during that update part. What I do really like though is the fact that when you sometimes go to apply, like if you have an object group... and it's empty, that will kick back in and say "you know what, this is empty, I can't do this". It's really nice that feedback. Yeah you've got to admit some of the warnings where it tells you you have policy, that does work rather well so far. The little exclamation points that kind of tell you "hey this policy will be overridden by that policy". And that's one of the questions I have. For ASA firewalls we have a tool called Skybox which will tell you what will pass through the firewalls... what will not pass through the firewalls. And again this gets back to the policy check tool you have under health isn't completely reliable with the full ACA policy. What will go through a firewall, what will not from our deployments would be interesting; sort of a policy mapper I guess, or a policy test is really complicated. Because now you layer all these things on top of one another and it's hard to figure out like "wait will actually pass through? what won't?". Now I have to go all the way back to the connection list to see what block... The packet tracer doesn't work well so far. It's not 100% accurate. It's far from 100% accurate. It doesn't even actually seem to completely function for most of the things. It seems to catch some of the prefilter lists, some of the security intelligence; the prechecks, like the ASA check. But once you get into the actual AC policy with the [unintelligible] filtering and all that, it seems to go right past it. Like you know I had a blocked website I was going to it and it just says "you're allowed', and you're like "no I'm not". Why, why? And I mean the connection tables show you what policy you struck, but you just have to go so many different places to check that policy... check, it would be good...Like as I said skybox you put in almost like that policy check tool and know if it is or is not blocked and what policy it strikes. But I do like the warnings like this, or the warnings like that. You guys do have pretty good warnings. Yeah, these are empty. Like that flex config and stuff like that. Really my biggest complaint is about integration; you guys are all over the place. You can clearly see it's Firepower layered on top of ASA. That needs to come together, and I'm guessing it will...it will come together more over time. I'm sure, but that's... between that and then just as I said the services across the entire Cisco portfolio. Like if Talos is running the show, then they need to run the show. That is also another thing that [unintelligible]...And that is the way Cisco identifies applications and how we can look up details around it.
6; ;00:25:00,840 --> 00:30:01,380; ;That's fairly new for us, the application [unintelligible] and we may be migrating away from ASA. I was trying to figure out... For instance, there's this exclamation mark but then again it's very hard to really look under the hood unless you go into the details of the app ID and try to read the code yourself. To see what an application consists of in terms of ports and [unintelligible], and whatever it consists of to recognize... Yeah so in other words I'll give you an example and I'll follow up with Hans. As Skype, and we have multiple Skype things here, when you hover over this it kind of shows you a Wikipedia article or something, but it doesn't take you anywhere that shows you the actual app ID script. A better description, like what is the difference between Skype tunneling and Skype, or Skype filing I mean I see you guys have a good amount more for Skype, it's pretty broken up well. But still though, what is Skype tunneling compared to just Skype? Is it really just video and voice? And just a detailed description. Yeah if I may compare this to Palo Alto, they have an "appepedia", which is [unintelligible] Apple iPhone. It's very userfriendly, and then again that's one of the key things that I liked about the Palo Alto compared to Firepower, it's the way that you are more open to really getting into some... insight on how they [unintelligible] applications, it seems to me. So definitely that would be my [unintelligible]...provide some kind of [unintelligible] that just gives us more... and better insight into how to do this magic...[unintelligible]. Yeah, I know it's based upon open app ID and snort, but even the snort signatures themselves sometimes are hard to find and tell where they are. I know there's a library out there, but to really get to where they are...and then it just kind of shows you raw code, a little bit better of a description. Yeah. And then, as I said, the same thing for apps; like this app stuff gets...this is new. You have Skype for Business going to some CDN that has its own URL reputation. For business things like that, it gets a little interesting. Hans, how are we doing with the increasing of the database for the events? I know you increase it from the default to what, 10 million? And this is an interesting comment I guess we have. In our current structure I guess we have about 20 hubs. All our traffic goes through these hubs, so the traffic [unintelligible] is about 5 gigs on a daily basis, which with highlevel logging on a regular ASA is I think like 10 million events an hour. Which makes it complicated. I know FTD is going to probably be well over 20 million an hour if you take all the events together. We hit a database connection table limit, it looked like we were for, what was it? A gig? In the lab we were working at, we only had about 10 minutes of data and we had to manually extend the log size of the URL database. Or the connection table [unintelligible]. Which only got us to about an hour, so those numbers...that was a little... [unintelligible] They told me it's a database thing. And although a [unintelligible] can support let's say, I think it's 400 devices... It will never be able to cope with the logging of 400 devices. How are they applying it? What sort of logs do you collect today? Is it everything? We have, we want to connect all the connections to the tables, so the connection table events. We want to know where people are going... Where are they going? Of course, we want to know how to report it. Then we have the intrusions and the AMP events, and I guess the hosts and the vulnerabilities and some of the network discoveries. But I mean basically intrusion, AMP and connection tables are our primary stuff. We have it all logging I believe mostly at the end of connections, other than the blocks. But I mean, you know, you're talking 30 thousand users to 40 thousand users may be going out of the 9300 [unintelligible], all logging into a single FMC. Probably would be well over, I'm guessing 10 to 20 millions events per hour.
7; ;00:30:01,380 --> 00:32:26,140; ;I know our [unintelligible] four proxies, in a month's time we did 4 billion web requests. Exactly, I mean my bluecoat reporter server is just for the get requests and the post requests, or the HTP requests. I'm into two different 4 terabyte disks, holding only 30 days of data. I mean the databases are well in the billions. For an enterprise solution, we're going to throw logs out there and we need this. And mind you this is only logging the end of connection events. So if you guys ever get to [unintelligible] requests it's going to be...You're going to need the reporter. Or we're going to have export it into a SIM; and if it's exported into a SIM, a standard log format that's not variable, with a written parcer for different vendors. Work with some other vendors. As I said, you're not going to have your own SIM, or your cloud portal SIM, or Cisco Cloud reporting service and the web... you know some providers have; I know Umbrella has its all in the web, even though they export stuff to S3. You know, writing parcers for RSA or Splunk, or other things; I think there is a Splunk parcer out there but, that type of thing. [unintelligible]. Are there any questions on the list for me? No, Hans, I think we've covered most of what I needed from you. As I mentioned, I'll be connecting you specifically to someone on my team called Katie to look at some install and feedback. But I really appreciate your time, thank you for staying on the [unintelligible]. You know, I'm [unintelligible]...it's also interesting for me, always interesting to get feedback on the tools I use...so okay. I'll be looking forward then to the followup, and then talk to you later. Sure, yes thank you Hans. Appreciate it, take care. [unintelligible]
1; ;00:00:02,080 --> 00:05:10,666; ;Take 3. Thank you guys. So yeah I think I'm going to open it up now if you guys have feedback on FMC, CSM, ASE, FTD. Whichever it is, you can pick and just go one by one  So, let me... I can give you some honest feedback. I feel that this product is very early in its life cycle and now we are suffering a lot of pain because of it. You know a lot of upgrades, every time we turned around we needed a new upgrade, we have to identify the cog, which means we have to go above something that we already have and... I am a little concerned about the product maturity at this point. Alright. And you know some of the features sets where we have to... I can't remember...on exactly what you call that but within the FMC where you have to basically use that workaround built in to the FMC because the feature is not there yet. Hans, do you remember the name of that, like where we had to build Flex [unintelligible]? [Unintelligible]  Yeah, [unintelligible], yep. So I'm just concerned about product maturity and the fact that we're rolling it out into an enterprise environment. A little young. True. Thank you. And yes I would like a candid feedback so I'm not going to be offended by anything you said, so it's perfectly fine to tell me whatever you think is a [unintelligible]. So just, I guess, the cosmetic part. I know you guys, I believe, are planing a reporter for FTD? Like a separate reporter applies this, cause I've got to admit, the reporting function [unintelligible] and the tool itself is rough. My biggest concerns are: basically adding or removing columns from this and being able to extend columns or move columns around. So in other words, you know, I can remove a column and sort of add it but I can't slide the placement, so it's a cosmetic thing but... You know sometimes I don't need all this data in the front. Like zones, I can't just wipe that out and move stuff over left, right. You know, almost, I guess a slightly good example if I showed you was... I just show you... Basically what I'm talking about so Iris has a pretty much straight functionality of column management and column order. I don't know if you guys want to steal it necessarily but you know. So I mean you pick different columns and then slide the order up and down. Right.  So you can basically make that kind of table how you want it. You see what I'm saying? And instead of having to export it into a CSV and manipulate everything in a CSV. But I'll admit if you guys have a new reporting tool out, hopefully this new functionality will be in that reporting tool. The other portion I have, or basically what we have is, I'm sure you're aware of the all the different databases within your actual tool. You know like IDS is separated from the SA logs, the connection logs are different, they come out in different interface and port, which we worked through and isn't that large of a scale problem The slight problem that I guess have is you guys create custom parcers for RSA, secure works or anything else for any kind of sims due to the fact of, this is standard or say a dump our connectionwise. The problem that we had is you guys don't use blank field placeholders. So in other words, you have each field in between, I guess parenthesis, but... If say like a client, like you see everything is sort of in an alignment, and then if a client application doesn't exist everything starts of sliding left. And it becomes hard to parse because basically if a client application doesn't exist, instead of saying unknown, or NA, or just a space, you slide everything left. Which means every parse blown out that I know about [unintelligible]. Our RSA can't even intake this at the moment. It's partly intake but there is a lot of missalignment. And then, you have the airplugs, and the snortlogs, and all these, and then how you... if they're all coming from a single IP then it's like what logs are which? The AMP for endpoint integration with the FMC does seem to function and work for showing the IOCs and other events I guess you would say for AMP point? Which would like to also pursuing for endpoint. However those logs don't forward out in the same CIS log. Which we were having issues with. So in other words, you could see them in the event we were in FMC you see AMP for endpoint in the areas that are compromised, scan completed like this. But it doesn't actually forward out in the log stream so if you could put into the seam with the rest of the [unintelligible] Which I'll admit, yeah, we are working with an API that pull down the cloud events but it's just something that, here you can see an event viewer but it's not in the fire power log, so now you have to go to another Cisco product.
2; ;00:05:10,660 --> 00:10:01,680; ;Overall, one of my concern was... I guess you guys have... I know you use RedCloud webroot for he URL filtering portion. Then you have the security intelligence list, which there is really no way to see. So you have a URL checktool that shows you the break cloud reputation, it doesn't show you if it's in a security intelligence list or not. So it's hard to know what those security intelligence list will block. So whether or not we would deploy them is slightly complicated than no. That's not the one I wanted. You guys have so many sites and to be honest you have Talos, which is separate than break cloud, which is separate than open DNS, Umbrella and even URL guy have a little difficulty tracking all that stuff. But I did have a partial question. Down here you seem to have a lookup tool that's the next gen fire power/fire power services and this category doesn't seem to be driven by break cloud. So I don't even where that plays into the fact. I don't even know... that doesn't seem to be break cloud, I don't know if that's security intelligence, it's like you seem to have whole another category. I guess what I would say is, alignment with all these Cisco products in with Talos and kind of having one source to say: this website will be blocked or no blocked. Cause right now, if we have a malware site, say a ransomware website, it's hard to say: Hey.... You know, security or somebody might ask me, intelligence say: Is this website locked? And I've got to look in 7 different places to figure out if Meraki, Firepower, security intelligence, all these different things in the event viewer: is it blocked, is it where, the policy trait still doesn't work a 100%. It's hard to say: Yes, this will be blocked across DHA or we need to add manually to a black list. That becomes an operational nightmare. That would be...  And this is it for every site that you going to.... I mean every... I mean literally anything if we ever say, hey, we want to block... You know, we get through our feeds from... Now I know you guys are making... I forgot what it's called. Cisco intelligence center where the optics, and tax feeds, and threat feeds coming into a single device that will hopefully, I'm guessing, propagate across open DNS fire power Meraki but I'm guessing it's all going to be fire power at the beginning. I would love a single source where I can put a single... I mean, we're building API lists. To do all these stuff with automation, to keep one black list.. I would love more than that You know I could either submit or lookout a website... go to basically an iron port website... you know, the Talos website, sort of? I always get them confused even, you can see I'm already confused. The Cinder based website, which is now Talos intelligence... So just say, you know: what is the category of my website, what's the reputation health? I see you guys you have a list that shows if it is blacklisted or not. But it doesn't line up across all the tools. Like I would rather, you know, either a central site like Talos, I'm guessing it's going to be where it tells me... it's good across all the different devices or what these categories are. And then if I submitted to them and say: Hey, that looks like ransomware. It propagates all the tools. Cause mind you, we even have the CT functionality and the current AMP for endpoints. Which we have our blue cold logs going into a generated events however the firepower because the logs are so different don't even play into your own device and that... I mean... That's hard to say, I mean even to my management I have to tell them basically CTA is going away. So as we phase out the Blue cost for fire powers we are basically losing that functionality. Got it. Ok. And just even in that alignment, you know, you look in CTA it tells you it's malware and then you look in RedCloud or something else or Umbrella and it's like: No, it's neutral, a benign site. You're like, one of these is wrong. It's just that real centralized management, I mean I know I mentioned this to some of the higher Cisco guys. It really needs to be... rapid. I think that's probably the most rapid changes needed; centralizing your intelligence... really getting I mean.... At least lining you up in some type of way where you can say: This is blocked across all these platforms, or not blocked across all these platforms, or you know, it's malicious across all the platforms, its health... You know file storage sharing, however you guys do it, it's bad reputation/good reputation, but it just doesn't seam like Talos intell.... They all line up differently. [Unintelligible] I don't know if I have... Yeah and basically the CTA part, the fact that it doesn't record all the HTP gets and pushes in that single TCP...
3; ;00:10:01,680 --> 00:15:06,660; ;Sorry who doesn't record? So, FTB records either the beginning of a connection or the end of a connection, it doesn't record all the get requests. Which is why the CTA I guess doesn't function because it's not a proxy. It doesn't record all the individual requests only the last request. Right. So, I mean, that's actually a gigantic security gap we have currently. Placeholders... I've got to admit the way the logs come from all different IPs is just... That took us a lot of time to work it through. But I mean I could see that where a single reporting tool will help with that, the single server intelligence system may help with propagating, or blacklist, or threat feeds, you know... Bulk loading of URLs, so that was what I was going to say, like Fishhouse or spam, or threat, or threat grid; somebody gives us a list... FBI even gives us a list of 200 websites sometimes. And then it's like okay, blacklist all these websites. Now how do I do that? You'll have a bulk load necessarily, I know at least in that other portal... you could load multiple URLs at once, which is good, but it doesn't propagate against all, you know, all the tools. Those are probably, I guess you could say, security technology operational. Questions of that kind of centralized policy push, I know we attempted to make within our actual policy, I guess you have a threat feed option to pull URLs from a text list. Yeah, like technically a threat feed list. to be able to pull from an object that pulls updates from a text file on a server, and I guess eventually that will become a threat feed, but we're trying to use some of that functionality to control our blacklist. Did you try that again, now? I have not tested that, again with the lab in its current state you know... Yeah, you were going to get another server. I did get... so our network [unintelligible] security automation tool, we have a phantom tool which does our automation that has integrated with Umbrella, so I actually have a blacklist that... can be pushed out and up into the Umbrella API. I don't know if Meraki has one that wasn't a Meraki phantom connector yet, but there is an ASR, ISR, and ASA connectors; there's not a Firepower connector yet. Native built into the tool, but really working with other vendors because I'll admit we're mostly a Cisco shop. We're mostly a Cisco network shop at this moment, but as I said even Meraki, which is technically a Cisco project, but yet is a different stream. And Umbrella is a different stream, they don't even integrate. So you can say "hey we're a Cisco shop", and they're still not integrated. So you know that's a big problem; nevermind our legacy tools, our other tools, other portals; things integrating together has become almost worse than it was. I understand what you're saying. When we're with a single vendor now. As I said, I haven't driven into the, I guess you would say, this host table stuff, and like the sock functionality of this; our sock isn't even drilled into this with host mapping or... Where am I even going, is it hosts? Where's the 14 or 04, where is that? I forget what it's called. Oh like the threat level? To be honest I don't even know. Isn't that on their application? I get lost with this device myself to be honest. I'm still trying to understand what is it the 14 thing is related to. There's a 04, I believe it might be intrusions, it might be on the intrusion tables. And this date/time thing, this time thing could use an improvement. Whether it's paused, like the pause and not paused is weird; you figure if it's unpaused it should be live streaming and then when you pause it it should freeze. It doesn't seem to function like that, impact files. Yeah, and we haven't drilled into, I mean I've looked at breakset 50 where he gets into the indicator compromises and kind of how to do this. We haven't moved our sock to that type of operation. So they're still very eventdriven, but not mapped to have you guys map OS fingerprinting... or ability fingerprinting to the host table [unintelligible]. I'll admit the vulnerability mapping is a little rough due to the fact that I guess you guys fingerprint a Windows 2003 server. And then you just list all of the potential vulnerabilities for that server and then the [unintelligible] for that trip.
4; ;00:15:06,660 --> 00:20:02,500; ;Not saying whether or not it was compromised or not compromised; so in other words you can see a [unintellible] signature was blocked, so technically it was blocked... meaning, you know, was the server even compromised? So if it's an inbound request in that DMZ that attack never even reaches the server; so how much do I care about that impact? And you know you have the [unintelligible] signatures are I guess more like command and control, so you can say "this guy is compromised". Now I don't know how well that maps out, but it seems like there's a little bit of loss; and then that inbound signature says "well you know, it's a 2003 server, it may have this list of vulnerabilities... but we don't know if those vulnerabilities are patched or not. And that's where it get a little hazy... I guess people get confused of what some of it means, and it gets a little bit the break set training set classes we've seen, but do you guys have... training classes for a sock, or a training program, to say this is how we expect you guys to work in the portal. how to look at it, what you'd think a sock should do, see what I'm saying? Instead of me training them on how this tool should function. Like I don't want to write my whole own training class to train our sock on how impact flags and all these things work. Like I talk to them about it but they all seem completely lost, because again they work from just "hey we see an IBS signature file... we do XYZ, but we see this specific signature file and we do that. You guys are, I mean I like the way you guys line it up, but it's just a new way to look at things for a sock. And I just don't think we have the knowledge of it; I don't know what trainings are available or can be pushed into our overall ELA or anything like that. It's definitely going to become different for how we work. Yeah, I don't have an answer for the trainings, I guess... Yeah, as our customer success manager we've had some troubleshooting training things, but just that overall... if there's an actual sock...Like this is how we expect you guys to maybe look at reports, this is how you would look at things... I mean the Cisco Prime things did a good job, not just sending somebody a half hour or 45 minute video... and go "read through the slide [unintelligible] and learn how to use Firepower" is a little rougher than... an actual just a few minute class, an instructional class even more; even if it's just a Youtube series... 1,2,3 like beginning, into... Well like I know you guys have the Cisco training website that has some of the decks and just some that kind of like beginner, second... Yeah well they have a Youtube channel. Yeah, that too. Yeah, that's a fair point. I know it might be out there. Yeah so the question on the training actually [unintelligible] also asked me if for her guys there was a file power thing available... We reached out to the Firepower instructor that we have over here that actually gave a Firepower course and mentioned that there was no available [unintelligible]...some kind of custom training and he was able to deliver it. Probably that will be the training to take or to look at. Unless the Cisco guys really come up with something other that [unintelligible] portfolio; Firepower at this point was not delivering them... Well if you've got [unintelligible], I could probably keep talking... [unintelligible] And no feedback is too small, so if you've guys have got something that's very specific to a page, like you mentioned the columns that's fine. Yeah, and to be honest, I noticed even in the guide I don't know...Hans is really all the different services. Every time we go to troubleshoot, we're getting this CLI, we're restarting individual services and what they all do. It just doesn't seem to be listed out yet, well out in the public or someplace. I think that's part of this is a new product. With the ASA there's a wealth of resources. We can type "ASA how do I do that?" and you're going to get 100 different websites. 50% are Cisco, but the other 50% you're reading about how other people explain it. And there's not that wealth of knowledge on the web for this product by any means. But in terms of the...I noticed from the few cases that the team has opened you started building like "oh I know I have to click and generate troubleshooting files...
5; ;00:20:02,500 --> 00:25:00,840; ;And post it somewhere intact of whatever sites. I told you we participated in the beta... It should be something better, a [unintelligible] Well in other words in autoload, I know some other tools have the thing where it just autoloads directly to a tag case. Like bluecoat has this sort of button where you literally put in the code number and it updates automatically. Well that too, but I'm talking more about the [unintelligible] analysis to say "listen, I'm running troubleshoot problems, hit this button... you run your own self checkin, right. So like check the... Everything and verify every single service, process that's run, etcetera, because again we run into the [unintelligible], for example say you... upgrade an HA pair you're supposed to break. And so well you know that I'm an HA pair, why don't you just check yourself? Cause I have now disabled yourself, [unintelligible] and why do I have to do it? It's very simple to use a program into the tool, all these things that I checked for. And so before I even contact...well I mean you can start the service yourself, and I don't even have to open it. Okay, because all he's going to tell me is "this service didn't start, do it yourself". I say well do it yourself; it's supposed to be nextgeneration firewall so I shouldn't be going through much pain to troubleshoot this. Also more feedback during the policy update process. Like we understand that at some point during the policy update process we all take a brief interruption to service depending on what we're doing. A message that says "okay now your interruption of service is starting; now it's over", instead of having 6 minutes and 30 seconds of policies just churning and churning. There's not very much feedback during that update part. What I do really like though is the fact that when you sometimes go to apply, like if you have an object group... and it's empty, that will kick back in and say "you know what, this is empty, I can't do this". It's really nice that feedback. Yeah you've got to admit some of the warnings where it tells you you have policy, that does work rather well so far. The little exclamation points that kind of tell you "hey this policy will be overridden by that policy". And that's one of the questions I have. For ASA firewalls we have a tool called Skybox which will tell you what will pass through the firewalls... what will not pass through the firewalls. And again this gets back to the policy check tool you have under health isn't completely reliable with the full ACA policy. What will go through a firewall, what will not from our deployments would be interesting; sort of a policy mapper I guess, or a policy test is really complicated. Because now you layer all these things on top of one another and it's hard to figure out like "wait will actually pass through? what won't?". Now I have to go all the way back to the connection list to see what block... The packet tracer doesn't work well so far. It's not 100% accurate. It's far from 100% accurate. It doesn't even actually seem to completely function for most of the things. It seems to catch some of the prefilter lists, some of the security intelligence; the prechecks, like the ASA check. But once you get into the actual AC policy with the [unintelligible] filtering and all that, it seems to go right past it. Like you know I had a blocked website I was going to it and it just says "you're allowed', and you're like "no I'm not". Why, why? And I mean the connection tables show you what policy you struck, but you just have to go so many different places to check that policy... check, it would be good...Like as I said skybox you put in almost like that policy check tool and know if it is or is not blocked and what policy it strikes. But I do like the warnings like this, or the warnings like that. You guys do have pretty good warnings. Yeah, these are empty. Like that flex config and stuff like that. Really my biggest complaint is about integration; you guys are all over the place. You can clearly see it's Firepower layered on top of ASA. That needs to come together, and I'm guessing it will...it will come together more over time. I'm sure, but that's... between that and then just as I said the services across the entire Cisco portfolio. Like if Talos is running the show, then they need to run the show. That is also another thing that [unintelligible]...And that is the way Cisco identifies applications and how we can look up details around it.
6; ;00:25:00,840 --> 00:30:01,380; ;That's fairly new for us, the application [unintelligible] and we may be migrating away from ASA. I was trying to figure out... For instance, there's this exclamation mark but then again it's very hard to really look under the hood unless you go into the details of the app ID and try to read the code yourself. To see what an application consists of in terms of ports and [unintelligible], and whatever it consists of to recognize... Yeah so in other words I'll give you an example and I'll follow up with Hans. As Skype, and we have multiple Skype things here, when you hover over this it kind of shows you a Wikipedia article or something, but it doesn't take you anywhere that shows you the actual app ID script. A better description, like what is the difference between Skype tunneling and Skype, or Skype filing I mean I see you guys have a good amount more for Skype, it's pretty broken up well. But still though, what is Skype tunneling compared to just Skype? Is it really just video and voice? And just a detailed description. Yeah if I may compare this to Palo Alto, they have an "appepedia", which is [unintelligible] Apple iPhone. It's very userfriendly, and then again that's one of the key things that I liked about the Palo Alto compared to Firepower, it's the way that you are more open to really getting into some... insight on how they [unintelligible] applications, it seems to me. So definitely that would be my [unintelligible]...provide some kind of [unintelligible] that just gives us more... and better insight into how to do this magic...[unintelligible]. Yeah, I know it's based upon open app ID and snort, but even the snort signatures themselves sometimes are hard to find and tell where they are. I know there's a library out there, but to really get to where they are...and then it just kind of shows you raw code, a little bit better of a description. Yeah. And then, as I said, the same thing for apps; like this app stuff gets...this is new. You have Skype for Business going to some CDN that has its own URL reputation. For business things like that, it gets a little interesting. Hans, how are we doing with the increasing of the database for the events? I know you increase it from the default to what, 10 million? And this is an interesting comment I guess we have. In our current structure I guess we have about 20 hubs. All our traffic goes through these hubs, so the traffic [unintelligible] is about 5 gigs on a daily basis, which with highlevel logging on a regular ASA is I think like 10 million events an hour. Which makes it complicated. I know FTD is going to probably be well over 20 million an hour if you take all the events together. We hit a database connection table limit, it looked like we were for, what was it? A gig? In the lab we were working at, we only had about 10 minutes of data and we had to manually extend the log size of the URL database. Or the connection table [unintelligible]. Which only got us to about an hour, so those numbers...that was a little... [unintelligible] They told me it's a database thing. And although a [unintelligible] can support let's say, I think it's 400 devices... It will never be able to cope with the logging of 400 devices. How are they applying it? What sort of logs do you collect today? Is it everything? We have, we want to connect all the connections to the tables, so the connection table events. We want to know where people are going... Where are they going? Of course, we want to know how to report it. Then we have the intrusions and the AMP events, and I guess the hosts and the vulnerabilities and some of the network discoveries. But I mean basically intrusion, AMP and connection tables are our primary stuff. We have it all logging I believe mostly at the end of connections, other than the blocks. But I mean, you know, you're talking 30 thousand users to 40 thousand users may be going out of the 9300 [unintelligible], all logging into a single FMC. Probably would be well over, I'm guessing 10 to 20 millions events per hour.
7; ;00:30:01,380 --> 00:32:26,140; ;I know our [unintelligible] four proxies, in a month's time we did 4 billion web requests. Exactly, I mean my bluecoat reporter server is just for the get requests and the post requests, or the HTP requests. I'm into two different 4 terabyte disks, holding only 30 days of data. I mean the databases are well in the billions. For an enterprise solution, we're going to throw logs out there and we need this. And mind you this is only logging the end of connection events. So if you guys ever get to [unintelligible] requests it's going to be...You're going to need the reporter. Or we're going to have export it into a SIM; and if it's exported into a SIM, a standard log format that's not variable, with a written parcer for different vendors. Work with some other vendors. As I said, you're not going to have your own SIM, or your cloud portal SIM, or Cisco Cloud reporting service and the web... you know some providers have; I know Umbrella has its all in the web, even though they export stuff to S3. You know, writing parcers for RSA or Splunk, or other things; I think there is a Splunk parcer out there but, that type of thing. [unintelligible]. Are there any questions on the list for me? No, Hans, I think we've covered most of what I needed from you. As I mentioned, I'll be connecting you specifically to someone on my team called Katie to look at some install and feedback. But I really appreciate your time, thank you for staying on the [unintelligible]. You know, I'm [unintelligible]...it's also interesting for me, always interesting to get feedback on the tools I use...so okay. I'll be looking forward then to the followup, and then talk to you later. Sure, yes thank you Hans. Appreciate it, take care. [unintelligible]
1; ;00:00:00,000 --> 00:05:05,200; ;Yeah, so that way we can just focus on [unintelligible] just leave this here. Yeah, so first of all, thank you for agreeing to see me, I understand you got stuff going on, so. Yeah, yeah, no problem. Yeah I really appreciate it. Yeah, Liz was kind enough to make the introduction and I believe we've met at a Customer Forum but I cannot remember. I don't know if.. It could be. Yeah, I've gone, I go every year. You do, right? I think I've either met you or at least I've seen you at more than one [unintelligible], I usually make it to most of them. Yeah, the invite just came out for the new one. Yeah, I think though now the [unintelligible] it should be once a year, now it's once every 18 months or so... -...Is what Liz was telling me? -Yeah that's probably sounds right. Yeah I think they rolled them through a longer time frame. Yeah. Ok, so I'll probably see you there then if you're making it again. Yeah I'm gonna try to make it, I'm trying to get my schedule together before I respond. -Ok that makes complete sense. -That's it, I think middle of November. Oh ok, yeah, that's a good time. I have to see if I can make it, I just moved to Austin. They let you move to Austin or did they move you to Austin? A bit of both, so, like, we were trying to find someone with my skill set in Austin, they couldn't find anyone local. Right. And I used to work pretty close with the team there. And so my boss was asking if anyone wanted to move, at which point I said "Sure, I'll do it." And I visited Austin a few times, so I knew how the city.. It's a nice city. I really liked it so I figured, "Hey, why not", you know, like, no [unintelligible] taxes, reasonable housing prices. So I just moved last week, so still unpacking, getting set up. Right. In a rental and then we'll start looking for a house in a couple of weeks. Nice. Yeah, I think you'll like it. I definitely think so. I mean, I'm sure I'll like it, that's why I decided to move and I really don't have any plans of going back to the Bay Area. I think it's good to visit, but it's crazy expensive if you want to try to get a house or settle down. It's not doable. Right. Well, that's cool. Yeah. How are you guys doing, did the hurricane affect..? No, I mean, it did, this area a little bit, but we were okay right here. Okay. And then, I live on the north side of town, off 290, and my neighborhood was totally fine. Totally good. And everyone else in office doing okay as well? There was a few people that lost the flood and stuff. Not my guys, but people in the building, yeah, they flooded. So what happens? Can they recover their house in any sense, or do they have to rebuild the whole thing? No, I don't know if they.. I think one guy has totally lost his house maybe. OK. They other ones, they flooded, so they, you know, if they have insurance, they'll have somebody to do it for them. You know, take out all the sheet rock out on the first floor, and spray everything, and disinfect, and then rebuild it. OK. But usually, these structures, the structure is okay even for [unintelligible], like. the basic structure? Oh, yeah, yeah. Ok. [Unintelligible] Cause they put the slabs down in the ground. Ok. With steel bars and stuff like that. So that's not going... Our ground moves a lot here, so the way that they do the slabs, they make it to where they put tension bars like this in all the slabs and when the ground moves the slab moves with it. Ok, oh. Interesting. Yeah. Well, I didn't know Texas was on a.. Are you close to the [unintelligible] epicenter here in Houston? There's a little bit of, there are some fault lines here, I don't know where. But nothing big, we don't have big earthquakes, no. California, every couple of months you'll feel a tremor, so.. I've never felt one over here in forty something years, so. That's fine. So then, why do you need the foundation that goes with the ground? Because our soil has a lot of clay in it. Oh, so it's not for earthquakes, it's for.. Yeah, it's for the way the soil is, yeah. So do you have like houses that sink a little bit every year or whatever or... I haven't heard of that but I guess they could, I mean it's just clay, it kinda moves around a little bit but then yeah we get a lot of water, it's dry, it's not dry, you know, depending on the season. It keeps changing. Interesting. You guys have a lot of rock in your soil, in Austin. We don't have the rock down here, in Houston. So do you guys have basements? I'm assuming no? No. Ok. Yeah, we'd get wet. I would imagine, as you said, if it keeps moving, I don't know if they can keep it structurally sound [unintelligible] basement, not a good idea. Ok, great. So yeah, perfect, so let's get going. Could you just tell me a little bit about how you guys are set up on.. with your security, like what products you're using, and also like a quick, rough summary, it doesn't have to be exact, on how many devices on each type that you have? So we're using... and my team manages all of this, we have Cisco IronPort for email and web security. We've go, we've had ASA's for internet firewalls, which were the X series, so we converted those to FTD now and FMC is managing those. And we just recently purchased some 4110 FTD's to replace our McAfee IPS. I see.
2; ;00:05:05,200 --> 00:10:00,100; ;And that box, the way it sits in the network is it sits.. The MacAfee IPS was a traditional IPS, so it was a bump in the wire in full blocking mode. And basically all the networks that came in to the data center would go through the IPS before they got into the data center. Ok. So this was inline? Before they could access servers. Yes inline. I see. And the FTD's are gonna be the same way. Ok. Except for they'll have firewall capability and transparent mode. I see. So, I've got my data center that's in Austin going through that model right now, and we're trying to transition this data center to that model. This being the one in Houston? Yeah there's one on the fifth floor. Oh ok. I see. And then, do you have a rough estimate of how many FTD devices you have? Since you mentioned your transition from ASAs to FTD. We've got two, one pair in our Austin data center for the internet so that's two there, it's a fair number so it's kind of one. Same thing here. Then we've got the data center 4110 so there's two in a cluster here, two in a cluster in Austin and then we've got a wireless firewall for the wireless users in his building, the guest users and the WiFi. Just the guest users in this building and the WiFi users in this building going through another one and that may be about it. So, four, about five different sets of devices. Sets. Yeah I counted about ten, so since they're in pairs it's one. Yeah. Yeah, five different sets doing, you know, and really just three different functions. So data center, internet and then wireless. And then wireless. We've got some other ASAs doing B2B VPN, remote access VPN, branch WiFi VPN, some different things like that but those are running FTD. Okay, fair enough. So, the conversation for today is not just focus on FTD but it's focused across everything that you do in terms of security. Barring email and web so [unintelligible] like network security. How you're set up, what are you doing so you do have ASAs besides the FED appliances that you have to put up. We do. We've got Cisco ISE as well. Cisco ISE, I was gonna you ask that when you mentioned guest access and such, so. Yeah. You're using Ice for that. So you have Ice, you have an FMC. One, or more than one FMC's? One FMC. One FMC, that's controlling all these five pairs, or so. And, how do you manage your ASAs, since you mentioned you do have ASAs as well? And is that you team, or is that..? That's my team as well. They're all managed individually, except for the ones that control our PCI environment, those are some 5585s. Those are managed by CSM. And there's a set of firewalls in each data center as well. Ok. So, roughly how many ASAs do you have, you have an idea? Just ASA's, that aren't FTD? Yeah, not FTD, just traditional ASAs. Individuals, and then the PCI ones. I don't even need a decent estimate, just a [unintelligible], ok. About twenty, about twenty, yeah. Ok, and you do have PCL compliance and [unintelligible]. Ok, is there a reason why certain ASAs are controlled individually while others are using CSM? Yeah.. I'm just trying to understand.. Well, the ones for PCI are using CSA because they share a common policy. I see. The other ones don't share a common policy and honestly we don't really like CSM that much so we only use it for where it's convenient, or where we need it. So, that's in.. the common policy was very important to keep the role sets exactly the same, because we move servers between those environments twice a year. So the role sets had to be exactly the same. The other firewalls just serve a function and they don't necessarily ever come in policy, between the data centers or the function is different. So the ones that are individual have very specific functions between those two sides, they're connected so they're managed individually. How do you then keep track of what's going on on each ASA? Do you guys do any of that or is it just a set [unintelligible]?
3; ;00:10:00,100 --> 00:15:00,220; ;That's kind of set and forget, we don't change it unless we have to, the VPN ones we don't change very much unless there's a new BoB vendor, VPN or something in there and we'll change it, we monitor them with Q radar. Or SIM for rules and events and stuff like that cislog, changes we monitor that with a SIM as well, we've got a daily report that goes out every morning to all my guys with all the changes, all the firewall changes from the night before, from the last 24 hours. So that's kind of our peer review for firewall changes. And we have change control to make changes but that's more of an approval from the business units to know that we are working on something that may affect our business, but we keep track of it with our tools, our sim and stuff. I'm going to have to park that discussion, because I do want to dive a little deeper into the whole change management that you're talking about, both from a monitoring perspective I believe you said there's a report that goes out, and then also how they get approved, since you said in certain cases you get approval from business or the business sends another question, so I'd love to get a little more on that and please, if you have to take a call.. It's fine, these are just.. Alerts? No, not alerts, I've got a hunting trip coming up and they're talking trash on here. Awesome. Ok, let me just see where we're at and we keep going. And do you have any other security solutions deployed aside of the ones we talked about? We have Cisco Amp, and the endpoints, and then we have it on the network devices as well, the email, the web security and the firewalls, the internet firewalls. We have a 5/4 application firewall, a web application firewall, [unintelligible] you know, that type of stuff. Getting rid of the MacAfee IPS, so that will be going away soon. We have MacAfee on the endpoints as well For antivirus I presume. For antivirus, but we also have [unintelligible], and drive encryption, and stuff like that and let's see what else we have. We have [unintelligible], which is Netscope. And the sim, which is Sim is Q radar, and we have a third party monitoring our sim as well. So how does that work? They co-manage it with us so basically we manage it, they get all the alerts from it and then they notify us when it's something we need to look at. -So we don't have a 24 by... -They vet the majority of the alerts and send the right ones to you? -They do. Exactly. Because we don't have a 24/7 sock. But that's what they do. They are a 24/7 sock but it's a hard device that we manage, they can also manage it too, because they have access to it. -Essentially their [unintelligible] is on 24/7 and... If there's something specific they can reach out to you off hours, or else you come in the morning and you get to see what's going on. That's how that works. So, you said it's a third party. So they have access to the same Q radar setup not... Yeah it's our Q radar, before we had a different one where they had their sim, we had our sim and it was a little different so we found somebody to just look at ours, because we have everything there. And [unintelligible] Q radar is pulling things off of all the devices, pretty much? All the devices reporting into Q radar. So even FMC is pushing data off into it. It is, yeah. Any FirePower devices, ISE or anything else as well or? Yeah the main controller events, PCI events coming off those servers, basically anything that will go in there. And have you guys set up any, I don't wanna call it rules, but have you set up any monitoring work flows in there to alert you of any specific sort of events, or? Yeah, we have a few custom ones, like if there's too many denies going to a PCI environment within a short period of time we get alerted on that. Some different things like that. Basically try to show us people scanning the network, we wanna be notified if they're scanning. And I'm assuming your PCIs environment is gonna be air gapped from a lot of the other stuff. Yeah, right now just for the firewall. So that's kind of the air gap there, the 5585. We have an IPS segment monitoring inside there, [unintelligible].
4; ;00:15:00,220 --> 00:20:05,080; ;That's kind of how that's.. Because we have our IPS basically in our parameter so anything that comes into the data center goes through IPS before it gets into the data center. And then from the data center we firewall off the PCI environment. Ok, understood. What does your day to day look like, like how does.. you come in and then what does that look like? Well, right now and really this whole year, we've just been busy with projects. Trying to get our systems upgraded, updated, you know, things like that. So that's what we're busy with constantly if we're not doing [intelligible] fix on something. And you said that there's a team so what's the team called? We're called Security Operations. Do you have a separate networking team or is it all rolled into your team? We have a branch network team and they managed the WAN and then my team manages the data center network. So we're a data center network and security operations. And does the branch networking team do any bit of security or is it all run through you guys here? It's all through us, we depend on them to have configurations, and the routers and stuff for security. So basically routers, switches and search is managed by them, but anything beyond that or coming in from the outside you guys take control of. Les from the data center will do that; all the data center switches and routers and stuff, we do that. Oh okay, so you do have some networking skill sets as well outside of... Oh yeah, we're the network architecture pretty much, just not the branch side. So it's more like you're driving stuff and then you're working with them to ensure that it's working on their end, which is at the branch locations and such. I see, okay that makes sense. And within your team do you have a division of responsibilities on various things or do everybody have to... I like everybody to be cross-trained but we do have certain product lines that different team members are responsible for managing. You know upgrading, the care and feeding of the system, they may be the primary expert on that system. Sure. And those kind of differ from team member to team member. And is your team also responsible for everything from when the box comes, like you get a box shipped to you, to bringing it up to speed, like provisioning it and deploying it? [unintelligible]. If it's a virtual then we'll have the virtual team spin it up, the server team spin it up and then we'll take it from there. Okay just for the spinning up bit, but like configuration, onboarding, all of that is still done by your team? So you guys are responsible for the whole end-to-end lifecycle of that as long as it's a security appliance or a security product. Yeah, okay. Interesting. Yeah, I think that gives me a good sense of how you get. And how big is the team? How big is your team? It's me and 4 guys. This includes everyone on the network and whatever that you guys do all of that so it's just 5 people in total. And how big is the network branch? We have about 800 branches. Do they have one person on site at every branch or so? No, no a lot of these are in Wal-Marts, so you'll notice when you're in Austin... Actually the Wal-Mart right next to my house has one. Has Web forest? Yeah, so we have about 750 locations like that. Inside a store of some sort? Inside Wal-Mart almost exclusively; there's a few that aren't. I see, I see. And then we've got, I don't know, 50 or 75 free-standing branches. They're all in Texas. And then we've got loan centers which we've started to get into recently. A lot more commercial lending in the past two years, so we've got some of those offices in California and Michigan, different places; but we're in about 17 states with the retail branch. The 800 branches that you mentioned. Right. And how do they get managed? Like if they're in a Wal-mart, does Wal-mart offer the tech support locally onsite? No, there's no tech support; we have field services guys that are out in the field. If they need to go to a branch, they drive to a branch and work on it. But they're employees of the network branch. No, they're part of the field service team. So you have a separate team that goes to service branches? We have a helpdesk, they're kind of the first line, call the help desk; if they can't fix they dispatch to the field service guys, they can go on site. And there's a few guys in each state, a team of guys in each state and they can go service the branch. I see, interesting. But it's a pretty small footprint at the branch; we're talking 10 computers or so. Right, yeah I've seen once, I have an idea of it's got a few computers, a few agents and that's how... Right, competitors, some people in SCS. So do you also have any security solution deployed onsite like an appliance deployed at a bunch of these branches? We're running DM VPN and they can only connect via encryption to the other branches and the head ins and that's it.
5; ;00:20:05,080 --> 00:25:07,400; ;Okay, so that's where all the, okay... Yeah, so it's an ACL on there and that's all it allows so basically all the Internet traffic and everything comes back through the data center and then goes out. I see, that's what I was trying to figure out; so you don't have a branch deployment it's all through the data center and everything's coming in. Right, yeah exactly. That makes sense. Yeah it doesn't scale well with 800 branches to put something. It doesn't or it does? No, if we put a security appliance at every branch... Yeah, that's also true. If it was a lone-standing branch, maybe I'm not even sure then but then yeah if it's... When we buy something we have to buy a lot of it. Definitely, 800 plus then right if it's at each branch? We can buy 2 big things and put them in each data center. Which I think is the way. Yeah, that's what we're doing now. Easier to manage for your team as well as your logistics in terms of pushing policies, securing stuff. Even visibility I guess. Exactly. Now that may change when we go to the cloud, because we're talking about doing more stuff in the cloud. We'll have to have, the cloud will essentially be another data center for us and it will have duplicate the security in the cloud that we have in our data center. -I have to think. -Right. That way we won't have to round trip through our data center to the cloud, we can just have the same security posture in the cloud. That would make sense. And again that makes it easier to manage because it's all running the same route sets, it's doing the same thing. Well at least as well as we can get it. Right, I understand. That makes sense. Okay, perfect. So you mentioned the helpdesk and I realize that that's separate team now, which again, and there's also a field services team which goes out. So how do you guys handle incidents? Like any sort of incidents. Like a user can get on the Internet to we have a CS breach or whatever; does it all come through the helpdesk? Yeah, it does. The reason I ask is you mentioned there's also a third party that's doing stuff for you, so when they find something do they actually open a helpdesk ticket? Yeah, if a field service guy was on site at a place and he saw something that we needed to investigate or get fixed, then he could open a ticket. And have it assigned to our group to get help, or he may just call somebody; but there should be a ticket. Same thing with the helpdesk: if a user can't get on, and it's an ISE problem or something can't get to the Internet, he'll call the helpdesk first. The helpdesk will try to fix it, if they can't then they'll assign to whatever group they think it should go to. And your group is one of those groups? Correct. So you guys also get ticket notifications and such? Oh yeah if it's ISE or something or they can't get to a site on the Internet, or their email is getting blocked, you know one of those things they're going to call us. And do they know who to assign the ticket to or do they assign it to your team? It comes to the team so somebody needs to pick it up. So you're all monitoring a queue and then just pick up stuff. Right, yeah. Okay. And same with the team that's doing the Q radar stuff, the third party, or do they just directly call you and say "hey you need to look at this"? No, we're the only one that assigns tickets to them. My group. Okay. Yeah they don't really have tickets, they more or less have...a ticket for them would be something on Q radar's networking. Right, no I just wanted to invert that question; so what I was trying to ask was... Oh when they assign a ticket to us? Yeah, do they assign a ticket or do they just email you saying "hey look at this"? Yeah, they assign us a ticket but it doesn't come back through our help desk; it's our own. So you have a separate ticketing system to work with the third party? Yeah, it's their ticketing system basically; so they have a portal and we log on to the portal and work the tickets through their portal. Okay, perfect. And this is where they'd say "hey you need to look at this, this and this." Yeah, we're seeing this; if it's a low event it'll just be an email. If it's high then they'll call us, but there'll be a ticket in their portal. Right so there is a track of what's going on or what has happened in the past and such, right? Yeah, and we can look and see how many tickets are open and closed for the month, all that kind of stuff. Okay and then let's say in this case when they open a ticket and say "hey you need to look at something" and someone on your team does. And if someone needed to know how you work with changes, I understand how incidents come to you, either through helpdesk ticketing or third party and such. So once you pick up a ticket and decide to work on it, what happens? Is there like a workflow that you guys follow? Is there a way you guys do it? You know there could be; we don't have a lot of them, a lot of the workflows built like playbook type things. But yeah there should be a process for what, if it's a standard type of a thing. You know if it's like an email that needs investigating, a phishing email or something like that. There should be a playbook that they can work through, or a procedure type of thing. -That area is [unintelligible]. How do you guys [unintelligible], doesn't matter if there isn't one, my question is more around...
6; ;00:25:07,400 --> 00:30:06,620; ;How do you...if you get a ticket, what do you guys usually do? Do you just pick it up? Yeah, somebody will pick it up and they can see that they assigned it to themselves and they work it. Then if they need help then they'll go ask another team member; or we'll the chat clients and we'll talk about it on chat. And then until they figure it out, or they'll ask me "hey what do you do about this?", and then we can figure it out from there. And when it comes to making a change; I'm trying to get into the change management process at this point. Let's say you have to make a change on some of your devices to fix something, do you guys just do it? Well we have what's called exception changes. They're like non-network impacting changes. If we need to... If we need to block something on the firewall that's China or something, we just do that - no change control. Other things would require a change control; if there's a new server going in or something like that and they say there's firewall rules that need to happen. They may not know what they all are, but we have clearance to make those changes then because the change control kind of proved to do this new thing. And so that kind of stuff would require change controls. Daily operations usually don't require changes. As long as it's not network-impacting essentially. Yeah, it's usually just investigative work. You know they try to figure something is usually a non-event. Even the investigative work? Or it could be break-fix. If it's break-fix like something on ice isn't working and we have to change something on the switch at the local level, there is no change control for that. As long as business is not impacted, you guys can... Yeah and if it's one user or one branch or something, then that's not a change control item. If it's a configuration change that affects everybody, or all...we're kind of cookie cutter: everything should be the same. So if want to change our template, which would be everybody, then that's change control. Okay. If we're troubleshooting why some branch is not working and somebody's making changes to figure that out, those are change control events. In situations like that, let's say China, or a single branch and someone on your team has picked up a ticket, do they need to necessarily run it by you? Or if they feel they know what they're doing and they know all the changes, they can just do it. Yeah, if it's minor they'll just do it and they'll let the group know "hey, this is what I just did." Do you guys put it back on the ticket? It depends, if it's a ticket from our help desk, yeah we can put that in there, what we did. You know here's what we did, we added this to the allow list, or we denied this, here's how we fixed it; yeah that'll go in there. And the same with the third party, if they reach you and say "hey you need to look at this"; once you look at it do you just close the ticket out or do you put something back in there? No, we put something in the notes, whatever we did so we have something to reference. And when it comes to PCI, is it the same process or is it a different process? Well those are mandatory change control; any change in the PCI firewall is a mandatory change control because that's what we've agreed upon in our policy for the PCI devices. So what does guide change control look like? When you say change control, what do you mean? Let's say there's a ticket. It's usually the business units driving those, because it's usually a new system going in. Or something coming out, one or the other. So that... They'll figure out all the requirements and then they basically submit a change control. We have meetings every Tuesday morning upstairs and then there's also a WebEx. We meet about them every Tuesday and there's a change agenda that goes out ahead of time and you basically go through the changes. And then they have to get authorized by a senior manager before you put the change in. So someone from your team I'm assuming is also at the table reviewing changes with them, or? -Yeah. -Going through the whole list for... So basically you guys make changes and then every Tuesday is when you review them? Correct. Now the changes aren't that detailed; like somebody doesn't know what rule I'm putting in the firewall. They just know that there needs to be firewall work done on the PCI firewall for this system to work and so then we're authorized to go do the firewall work. But they don't need to know the nitty-gritty; for them it's like firewall change needed. Exactly. A security group is going to be making changes on the firewall. Right. And it's basically, the whole purpose is one audit trail, but also if something breaks then they can look back and say "oh security group is making changes to the firewall, we need to ask them if something happened."
7; ;00:30:06,620 --> 00:35:06,460; ;I see. So we have the groups involved, we don't know necessarily every little thing they're doing, but yeah. As it relates to your side of the operations, you'd need to get permission and then... Right, in the change control form there's something in there that says, whoever's filling it out, the business unit usually or requester. And then there's a yes we need these groups to do things. So there's a change control form that they fill out saying this is... Right, they fill the form out. Here's what we need, here's why we need it, and these are the teams that need to review it. And these get collected and every Tuesday you guys go through each of those and figure out this can be done, this cannot be done, whatever that is. Exactly. And once an agreement is reached, does your team just go and make the change? Yeah, there's usually a time that they think people are going to be making their changes. But yeah, you just make your changes. So you have to summon like time windows essentially? Yeah, because a lot of these things there's a maintenance window, and it's got to be done in the maintenance window. Some things they don't have to be, but that's usually agreed upon in the change control. That's part of the change control meeting to determine "hey here's when I want to do it." Is it okay with everybody that time; you know if you don't speak up then it's yes. Yeah, so that's the other part of why we're getting in there, to figure out the timing. And is there someone taking minutes of these meetings, just so that it's all documented? Yeah, there's in that change control form there's other things they're ticking as the meeting's going on. Okay so security [unintelligible], and so on and so forth, so it's all... RES has been authorized, or there's code to be released; the QA's checked away - all that's been done. I see, I see. That makes sense. And so do you guys also as part of meaning to be PCI compliant, are there any audits that get carried out? Or are there any reports that are generated once, I don't know 6 months? Our audit team usually does that; they'll come back and make sure. They'll go back and do spot checks.They'll say okay you guys put this system in. And they see the change controls for it, a type of thing like that. Do they ever come in and ask to look at the actual rules in the FMC and such? No, the PCI audit is [unintelligible]; they audit the rules in the PCI firewall. They would actually come in and sit with you and say this [unintelligible] software. Yeah. The main thing they're looking for is to make sure all the rules have comments. Not just comments, but business need justification and change control number if possible, that's what they really want to see. Would you actually show me something of that nature? Yeah, sure. It's the first time I'm hearing about it and that sounds interesting. This is really what they're getting to. So you're saying pretty much every rule, I'm assuming this is in CSM in this case. Or whatever your manager is, but yeah. In your case it's... You have a role and then next to it... Next to it they want to see 3 things: basically if there's a change control number for it, or how it was approved, the business need for the rule and the justification for it. So every time you come out of a meeting upstairs and actually have to make a change in CSM, you're actually putting that all in there. If I'm adding a new rule, yes. Or if you're making a change to the rule? If there's a change, maybe I'll put the change control ID next to it but the justification should already be there unless it's a system changing what it does. Right. If they put 2 things on a box versus 1, then I may have to add something to the rule that says "here's the new function." And here's the justification why they needed to do that. I see, interesting. Yeah, I'd love to see what that looks like. Let me see if I can make the screen bigger. I don't even think he knows I'm in, he probably doesn't even know he's in there. He probably forgot that work got done, keep him away I guess. All right, now it's not letting me. What is it waiting on? Maybe there's something running behind this? I did this earlier. Cancel.
8; ;00:35:06,460 --> 00:40:04,240; ;All right, here we go. Sign out later. So here's firewall, unified rules. So we've got the rule set here, let's see if I can find a good example. Not all of our rules have this. They do all have explanations. So like this one says "justification: remove the step of moving data from PCI server, PCI database warehouse to database warehouse (DB)." This will reduce the accessibility of debit card transactions data outside the PCI firewall, bla bla bla. Change control ID 4222. Would it be okay for me to ask for the screenshot of something like this? Because our PM team would be very interested in seeing what you guys do. Essentially my role here today is to collect as much as I can about how you guys work in order to make improvements for you guys. But if you can't, that's fine I completely understand, I have no idea... I can't do one of this, but I can do one of like this justification. That's fine as well, just so we know what you guys are trying to do. That screen is not... Or I might be able to do something. We just want to make sure we capture as much as we can from you guys, so that we can hopefully make something out of that which you guys can use. Yeah, it would be cool if there was maybe something built in the FMC or something, more than just a note field. Something a little more...I see what you're saying like they may want to put something in there that's searchable. Which is why I'm asking about PCI specifically, because we've got feedback that talks about the need for a little more when it comes to compliance related requirements. Either our tool doesn't support or maybe doesn't do as well as you'd like to. Yeah and the other thing around the PCI. I got another tool that basically, it's not a commercial tool, it's a guy who wrote it; and I think he was going to sell it but he didn't sell it; it was called WallParse. And basically it just takes all the rules, you take your rules from the CLI, just copy the config and paste it in there. And then you can run queries on the whole configuration; you can say like...and they're all sequel queries. It'll say like "show me anything where destination port is any." Select star where dest. equals any So you're sort of able to quickly audit your rules for PCI compliance. Exactly. -Thing that's... -Because they want you to make sure there's no 80s in there, you want to make sure there's no port 80s. They don't want to see any clear text traffic going through, so no Telnet, no [unintelligible], all these different things. Is this an open source tool, or did you buy this tool out from the guy or something? No he told me I could have it for free, I was going to try to buy it from him but he was going to sell; then he said it's not ready to sell yet but I'll give you a copy. Is it even on the Internet, or is it something just you have? No I found out, it's WallParse if you just look... Could you just put that in the email, just the name so that I don't forget and that way we can go look it up. Because these are exactly the sort of things we're looking for so that we can then see if we can do something for you guys. Any other such tools that come to mind that you end up using regularly, if you'd just tell me or just put them in there. Yeah, if I think of any I'll tell you. So is this something by yourself, or do you use this more when someone's come to audit, like PCI? Just when someone's come to audit, but it's a good check to see that somebody hasn't put something in. Because what's not clear in all these tools, when somebody edits an object and the FMC is almost completely object-oriented, then you don't know how it affects the overall rule base. It may not show up clearly to a user that somebody just put in a range of ports into an object that made you wide open. Or somebody put in a subnet in there for an object instead of just one host. So now you've just opened it up to a whole set. The rule says it allows one thing to this one thing. But the object says it has a whole subnet. The thing-to-thing is probably an object, and then when you... Yeah but you don't know that, because if you're just looking at the rules... The repercussions are not really obvious. Yeah they're not obvious when if somebody makes a mistake you don't know and I found that before in these configs where I go in and look at an object and it's got a lot of stuff in there that shouldn't be in there. And I thought it was very minimal, the rule was very minimal but it ends up being a lot.
9; ;00:40:04,240 --> 00:45:04,360; ;The rule's minimal but the object is where exposure was. And that tool when I'm searching for stuff like "hey where's this port allowed?" And then I see that it wasn't just 2 servers anymore, it was 30 servers. Well how did that happen? Because somebody screwed up an object but I don't know that. But at least that helps you find it and make changes to it. And CSM by itself does not give you stuff like that? I haven't seen it in there, I might be able to search for a protocol or something like that but I can't necessarily see where it's implemented in the rule base. You know those type of things. Packet tracer kind of tells you that, but you have to know what you're looking for; it's very specific. You know this tool is just kind of over the whole config. Thank you, I think that's good piece of information for us, for me to take back to my team. Yeah, I'm wondering how I'm going to do this type of stuff when FMC is the gateway for my PCI instead of CSM or... And is that the plan, are you moving towards that? Well I think somebody yeah we will, because that's the tool you guys are using going forward. You know eventually we'll be there. And that'll happen when you replace your ASAs in that environment? It could, or if I decide to do transparent firewall with IPS. Instead of routed firewall, I can just put it in there today pretty easily by making some rich LANs over and converting the rule sets. I could do that. But the other thing that FMC doesn't do well, and this guy...I can easily look at what's in these objects. And I can't do that with FMC. When I'm looking at rules, I can't easily figure out what's in that rule. And how did you say you do this here? Well I've got, on this one I've got two objects; one object saying permit from him to this guy. I can just right click on this object and I can hit show the object contents; I can see everything that's in that object. And FMC does not allow you to do that? It doesn't do that. So you need insights into objects on whatever? There's like maybe one screen that kind of does that when you highlight over it, but it's not consistent throughout the product. Like when I'm building rules, if I start building a rule in FMC and then I have an object, and I say "that's all I need is that object." I wonder what's in there, I can't see. Unless I open another screen and I go to objects and I look at it; so now I've got 2 windows open. Right. And that's what one of my guys he always keeps 2 windows open in FMC because you can't see. One is what he's using to discover stuff. One's what he's using that he's building a rule, and the other one he has to go reference back the objects to see if what he has is in there. Fair point. Okay I'll make a note of that. And so I'd like to switch gears a little bit to monitoring; I know we've covered it so is that all there is to it, which is you have a third party set up that does a lot of your 24/7... Yeah but that's mainly the monitoring; we use troubleshooting is a big part of what we do, not just monitoring. We're kind of using the same tools, we're using FMC and we're using the curator to do troubleshooting. Is the third party also helping you troubleshoot or does it just monitor and then... No, just monitor. So they just tell you when something looks funky, but you're the guys who are actually going in to see what it is. What needs to happen, or what's causing. Yeah, that's if we're investigating but a lot of our work is just "hey I can't patch my DMZ servers anymore, what's going on?" So that's troubleshooting; so then we have go find out if there's firewall block, IPS blocking. Okay so that's most likely coming from your help desk and its tickets. Maybe. If it's a server guy and his stuff's not working, he's probably hitting somebody up on chat. And if our guys were, usually we'll say okay yeah I see what it is can you send a ticket over so that we have documentation? Exact, okay. That happens a lot. So you do get pinged, but at the end there is a ticket no matter what. Yeah for most there should be; sometimes there's not, sometimes somebody may just say "oh I see what it is", quit bothering me. He should be opening a ticket, yeah. For the majority of the cases. Yeah, the majority. It doesn't really matter if it's one half part; so that's how you guys are doing it, through tickets, troubleshooting and such. But monitoring, a good chunk of it at least, like... A lot of the monitoring and troubleshooting is done with the Q radar. And so you guys are pushing everything off, so you're using e streamer and all of that to get data off.
10; ;00:45:04,360 --> 00:50:00,920; ;That's another thing with the FMC, it's kind of hard; there's so many different logging mechanisms. There's one for IPS, there's one for firewall events, there's one for e streamer; there's all these different things. And it's kind of hard to decipher which ones are doing what. Could you elaborate a little bit? I'm not... Well the e streamer is kind of sending everything, right. But he's sending it in a different format, so sometimes the SIM doesn't recognize all those things in the format; so they don't necessarily get parsed the right way. They don't necessarily say...they'll get classified as an informational packet that has a lot of data in it. And you can see the data if you look in there, but it doesn't necessarily classify it as a firewall deny. Whereas the syslog clearly says "deny", and it knows how to parse that. So we've seen that. But there's just, versus an ASA, the ASA logging was fairly straight forward because it was mainly just a connection advance [unintelligible]. With the FMC, there's so many different policies on there; each one's logging intrusion policy, connection policy, all these different things. It's kind of hard to figure out which logging is coming from what, and if you actually have all the logging that you need going to the box and you're getting it. And so do you still use e streamer to pull the data off? Though sometimes it doesn't give you... Or do you guys use... I don't know we use... I think it's probably going there but it's not as helpful as the other ones, because it's not...if the Q radar box doesn't parse it the right way it doesn't help us. Sure. And when it comes to monitoring, troubleshooting and that whole side of the fence, do you guys use FMC by itself with any of that? Like do you log with the FMC for any of that? Sometimes, not as much. So your primary use of the FMC is for? Why I like the reports in FMC, it looks like the dashboards would be helpful. The problem I'm having right now is it's not real clear what's in the dashboard that you're looking at. Because there's different domains and I've got different things in different domains. You're using the domains too. Yeah because I have some other groups that want to have access to the data, and that's the only way to do it is through a domain, you know give the user permission through a domain. Because I don't want them making changes necessarily to my other stuff, just this one thing that I give them access to. But the dashboards to me should be the same way. So you're essentially saying you want a superuser dashboard that shows you the whole environment. I think I have that already, what I don't have is show me what this dashboard looks like for this firewall. Or for this group of firewalls. You mean you want the dashboard to allow domain-level filtering? It has domain-level filtering now, but I'd rather see it go a step further and say I want to see what this dashboard looks like for this firewall. At a device level as opposed to a domain level. Okay I understand. Or a group of devices. It's different from domains because domains can be on multiple devices, but then you either want a subset or one whatever. Yeah, or maybe I want 2 domains instead of 3. Basically whatever you want, a way to customize to some extent. Because I have to do monthly security reports. And our wireless environment is completely outside of our network, it's just an Internet connection basically. So I'm managing that device in FMC but it's dirty, it's like those devices have a lot more stuff so if I mix that in with my reporting, it's different. You know because I'm letting vendors on, all kind of stuff. And so since we're on the subject of reporting, what sort of reporting do you do today and how do you do it? The mandatory reports are our monthly security meeting that we have, and I'll pull IPS reports for that; and they're basically like executive summary type reports. And I'll do Nessus reports, vulnerability stuff because we... We may have some vulnerability... [unintelligible] Or how are you creating these? Just with each toolset as its own. So when you say you're talking about Q radar and such, or FMC. Yeah you would think I would use a lot of our Q radar but I don't, but I usually use the tools, the manager of each tool. Okay so essentially FMC, or CSM, those are the only tools right? Well I'll use FMC which I've been trying to give reporting for, I'm not providing reports from FMC yet because I can't get down to the device level that I need.
11; ;00:50:01,340 --> 00:55:08,120; ;Oh you need to pull device-level reports sometime. Well that's what I'm saying, I don't want to mix in the Wi-Fi with my monthly report because then it looks bad. So you want to be able to exclude or include certain devices in the report? Exactly. So I'll include, like for the Mac VIPS I put that in there and I show like top 10 blocks, top 10 attacks type of thing, executive reports. And I'll do vulnerability reports from Nessus, I'll do IronPort reports from whatever, users. All exclusive summary sort of highlights. Right, and then we talk about these every month and then they also...that's from my group. And all the other groups bring stuff, McAfee, patching reports for Windows systems, all that kind of stuff. So this is a company-wide security meeting of some sort? And then those reports get compiled into a Powerpoint and that gets presented and we talk about it; and then it also goes to the board of directors. Who are you talking to, is it the CEO or someone like that? Or is it the CSO? When you say this meeting and you're talking about... The CECL runs the meeting and he reports them to the board. So you're presenting...it's for the benefit of the CECL every month to know what's going on with each team, what sort of security issues... Kind of yeah, but it's also for everybody in the room to know the different groups... Each team gets to hear as well, and you're talking to the CECL and the board gets a copy. That's why I was asking, because you said there's a monthly security meeting that you take reports to. Yeah, then we have a quarterly security meeting for just technical stuff. And that's more about projects, upcoming things, what we've seen in the last quarter, things we're having issues with, gaps, new tools we need, stuff like that. So you're doing like training, planning, all of that as well; so is that where you'd take stuff like "oh we need another ASA" and budgeting comes out of that? Yeah, budgeting wouldn't necessarily come out of that meeting, but yeah budgeting is kind of up to each group to do their own budgeting. I do all my budgeting, and then that rolls up to my boss to the CTO; but that's where we kind of plan for holes within the holes security environment. We have overlapping technologies, like we have AMP in my group even though I don't manage host security anymore; I used to but we pushed that off to another group now. Could you elaborate a little on that? I'm sorry I didn't catch you, so AMP is something that your team does not manage? We manage yeah. Oh you do... We do manage yes. But we also have a host security group. I used to manage host security products, I don't manage host security products anymore. But there's a separate security team for that? Yes, there is. Kind of like desktop security. Okay, understood. So that doesn't come under the purvey of your security operations. Yeah, not anymore, it used to. How big is that team? They're like, they also do patching too, they're more patching. So making sure all the Windows environments are up to a certain patch level, and so on and so forth. It's the same group. I don't know, there's 3 or 4 guys in that group, something like that. And they will be doing most of this remotely, given that most of your PCs are going to be at branches and such right? Besides what's in the building maybe. Right, understood. Interesting. I think I've covered a good chunk of what I needed to talk to you about. I think we covered making changes, so you walked me through the process that you have and that's fine. And I think...So one question. With CSM and PCI you're definitely...I'm sorry do you have to be somewhere? In which case... I've got to leave here in probably about 10 minutes. I just wanted to check the time, my son has a football game and I made the play sheet. Oh you coach them? I've got to meet the coach. No, but I did it on the computer because he doesn't know how to work the computer; so we have the plays on the kids' arms right here. You can do that, that's okay? Yeah, and they have a wristband and they put the plays in there; and then the coach has a copy and then he calls in the plays and they look. Wait so is that what they do it in the NFL too? Like do those guys have, so when they say a play number are you guys able to look it up? Exactly, not everyone. But the quarterback and then he can here's what we're running. The guy on the sideline could say "blue 4." Blue 4 so here's what we're running and then they've got that. I obviously had no idea, that pretty interesting. I guess when my son gets to that stage we'll see; he's 6 now so. Yeah, it's coming. I'm sure it's coming. Okay awesome, so I'll try not to keep you any longer, just maybe a minute or so; we're almost through so. Do you do any trend analysis? How do you do your planning? Like we need to add more devices or? Right, you know it's not really...I guess we don't have a good, we do our monthly security meeting we do 90 days, well we do 30 day reporting.
12; ;00:55:08,120 --> 01:00:06,220; ;So some of it might be seen in there if we're reaching something...it's not really... I don't know if we really have a good tool for it to tell us, you know like right now we're about to hit our limit on our Q radar for events per second. We just have to see that, we don't have a system to tell us that, we just have to see it. I guess kind of the same thing with our email appliances and web, I guess we just have to kind of see. I don't know if we have anything that tells us we're running out of bandwidth type of a thing. Sure. We have some network monitoring tools but they're not necessarily doing that for security products. Okay. Fair enough. I think I've pretty much covered everything I had; do you have any closing thoughts, or anything specific you'd like to share? Because I know you wanted to talk about FTD. Do you have something that... I'll mention just those, I think I kind of mentioned them already with the FMC, it's just kind of missing a few things for ease of use. Those are my concerns. Which ones? I know we talked about a couple of them, but if you have anything else to add. Yeah, just based on what you use, how do you use it. And do you guys use Spark? Yeah, I have Spark open here. Are you in any groups within Cisco? Do you talk to your SE or CSE? I'm on a select 150. Within Cisco, but I don't think I have...I'm just looking now. No I don't think I have one for my SE, or one for ELA or anything like that. The reason I was asking is because we are starting to try and build design partnerships with certain customers. Where as we work on a design for something, we can maybe throw it into a Spark room and have feedback from you guys. And I don't know if you have the time or inclination to join something like that. Yeah, I would. If I don't have time I just won't respond. Yeah, which is completely fine. We don't expect a response, or even a day to day response is fine. But if you're open to the idea, then maybe I'll see maybe work with Ned. Who do you work with and we can set it up that.. Slide too, the slide's not working for some reason. I mean I'd be partial to Spark given that I'd use it anyways. So who's your SE or CSE that you work with? Our SE is Josh Lathum. And who's the comm manager, is it Chuck? No, Witherspoon. That's our regular SE. Our security guy is like, I've met Ned before. Because when I told him I was coming here, he was like "yeah, I haven't been there in a while", so I'm not sure if he's... Yeah. I've met him and I've met some of the other security guys but I can't remember their names. I'll figure that out just so that you open the thing in the right way, I'll give you a call. No, I get 5000 sales calls a day, just keep that in mind. I'll figure that out just so that you open the thing in the right way, I'll give you a call. No, I get 5000 sales calls a day, just keep that in mind. Yeah, so I'll make sure, if you're okay with the spot group concept then I'll maybe make one. And you can maybe check in once in a while; and we have a product manager I'll throw in there with myself. Just so between design and product management; and it's also a good way for you to give feedback, anything that bothers you, anything that you think you'd want or like to see, if you can take a screenshot If you can take a screenshot of something that's there, and you're like this is missing; just throw it in the Spark room and say this is what I'm looking at, I'd love to see blah here. Yeah, that'd be great. I can't promise it'll happen but we can keep adding that to a list of backlogs, so we can start working through those when we go through a release planning cycle. That'd be great, because I get them and I'll just be sitting here like "damnit." You know my guys said... No that's perfect, so let me do that then, let me start up a group for that. And just one last question, I know you're running out of time. You mentioned that this year has mostly been around installs, upgrades and so on and so forth. What sort of upgrades have you been doing mostly, is it on the SEs? Our F5s we've been trying to get those off old boxes for a long time; that's converting all the VIPs, that's the big project, I have one guy dedicated. ISE we're going from 1.3 to 2.2, whatever. So that's been a huge project, because we ended up taking off posture a long time ago because it was screwing a lot of things up. And now we want to put posture back on, so we're trying to get to the latest release before we do that. And that's trying to finish that project up in the next couple months; then we've got the ASA to FTD conversion, which I've been doing.
13; ;01:00:06,220 --> 01:04:49,340; ;For the Internet firewalls, which is done now. Now the data center IPS replacements, so that's been eating up a little time. So for the ASA to FTD, did you swap boxes out or did you actually update the core from ASA to? We swapped boxes out. They're kind of running in parallel right now, so we've got two sets and we're still actually migrating a few boxes out of the DMZs over and we change the default gateway and type of thing. And how'd you migrate your own sets from ASA to Firepower? So we started from scratch. Ok so you literally got a new FTD device, brought it up to speed in terms of what it should be and then you either build the ASA box of or... Right. Transition it that way. Yeah it wasn't very easy but we took it as an opportunity to do a refresh on the [unintelligible] basically. Right and just to remind absolute last question, have you had the need or the opportunity to update the FTDs themselves from one version to another? I had to do that when I built the appliance but I don't think we've done a live appliance yet. Not yet, okay. I just upgraded the FMC to 621 the other day because I couldn't go straight from 620 to 622 for some reason. I see. Starting at 621 first, that's done. Now I'm gonna go to 622 and I'll do that one evening and then I need to do the personal devices so I'll let you know... Actually [unintelligible] I'll start up a Spark group and I'll ask you more questions on that. What are your reasons for upgrades when you do these, are you doing it for features or is for stability or is it... I'm hoping there's both. Okay. Yeah, right now the [unintelligible] thing where we've had a few issues with, I didn't deal with this one but a guy on my team he ran into something and I guess there was some database corruption I don't know but they got that fixed. I've had couple issues with failover on the FTD, it's really kind of on the ASA leaner side, if the boxes aren't seeing each other just right like a normal failover set then you can't push policy to it. So you have to get that failover fixed first and I had to reboot a couple times and switch over. Right. And then I could push policy again, that was an issue. We had another one with the source and destination object was the same, I don't know if that was [unintelligible] anything. I'm trying to think with one issue where we couldn't push policy I can't remember what we did to fix it but yeah we've had a few problems here and there, not a whole bunch. [unintelligible] Okay. Yeah. Alright and any feedback on the FMC nodal itself, else we could close, I know you need to be somewhere at some time. -Yeah I don't have exactly but I'll take screenshots of them... -Yeah. I was gonna say, screenshots or just put a road thing on this page or... I'll tell you the exact page, yeah. Yeah that's fine too. -But on this page, this is the one I'm showing where I would... -Right. Because this is the kind of information that we put in those monthly security meetings. Right. But I can't necessarily say... You know I can switch the domain up here. Right. ...And this changes but I can't get as grainier as I need and then the report designer, when I go into that I don't... This is where I thought okay I'm in the report designer. Now I can put which device I want to report on, I'm looking all around, I'm looking and there's no where to pick which device you want to do it on. Interesting, okay. No I see what you're saying, I get exactly what you're saying. Okay so this is something I'll definitely take back along with your other feedback and then I'll start up a spark room with a couple of us folks and then you or if you think there should other people from your team as well in case they have feedback. They're very welcome, it would be great and then of course from that time you'll probably [unintelligible] or say do you guys have time for a half hour call... -Right -In the next couple of weeks and then we walk you through some design work, that way you can see what we're working on, what's coming and then also get feedback before it actually gets built. So that if you're designing build to means but you actually want devices that's something that gets captured in the design process. Okay. So be faster to get stuff to you. -Yeah, yeah that'd be great. Yeah, okay, perfect. Thank you, I'll close the recording, I think that was good so let me just go ahead and...
1; ;00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:02,840; ;Welcome to this Quick Take rapid learning module.
2; ;00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:08,160; ;Today’s topic: Communication: How prospects first decide whether to trust you.
3; ;00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:13,740; ;In this Quick Take, we’re going explore how prospects first decide whether to trust you.
4; ;00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:16,200; ;Let’s start with a basic question:
5; ;00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:17,940; ;What is trust?
6; ;00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:25,520; ;In long-term relationships with buyers, it means they believe they can count on us to do what we say and to treat them fairly.
7; ;00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:31,480; ;Over time, we have the chance to say and do things that build and sustain trust with our customers.
8; ;00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:34,380; ;But what about buyers we’ve never worked with before?
9; ;00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:39,260; ;What causes buyers to trust, or distrust, you in your initial meetings?
10; ;00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:41,440; ;In this Quick Take, you will learn:
11; ;00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:45,340; ;The two factors that determine trust early in relationships
12; ;00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:53,040; ;How quickly buyers make decisions about trustworthiness, based on verbal cues that salespeople often trigger unconsciously
13; ;00:00:53,040 --> 00:01:00,860; ;And the four categories of verbal cues  – and how deploying them successfully will make people perceive you as more trustworthy
14; ;00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:12,620; ;Numerous scientific studies have found that in the very early stages of any relationship – including a buyer-seller relationship – the decision to trust someone comes down to two questions:
15; ;00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:17,880; ;First: Is this person on my side – that is, are they willing to help me?
16; ;00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:22,100; ;And second, are they competent – are they able to help me?
17; ;00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:33,300; ;A study from Southern Methodist University found that people make up their minds about these two factors within minutes, and that the judgments are remarkably consistent from one person to the next.
18; ;00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:44,760; ;The researchers found that certain verbal cues – cues that you can incorporate into your initial sales conversations -- will increase prospects’ trust and willingness to engage with you.
19; ;00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:57,980; ;In the SMU experiment, researchers videotaped college students who’d been asked to speak off the cuff about various mundane topics – their classes, their experiences at college, what was going on in their lives at that moment.
20; ;00:01:57,980 --> 00:02:11,460; ;Then the researchers showed snippets of these videos – each snippet lasting about a minute and a half -- to a second group of students and asked them to evaluate each speaker on a variety of measures, including trustworthiness.
21; ;00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:21,580; ;The researchers analyzed the language used in the interviews, evaluating such things as how often people used negative words and positive words and how often they referred to themselves.
22; ;00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:26,140; ;Then the researchers looked at how the language related to trustworthiness.
23; ;00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:30,940; ;They found four verbal cues that were associated with high perceived trust:
24; ;00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:37,120; ;Using fewer “negative emotion” words – words such as “angry,” “sad” and “wrong”
25; ;00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:44,340; ;Speaking  in the present tense – that is, statements focused on the here-and-now rather than what’s happened in the past
26; ;00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:48,680; ;Using fewer “I,” “me” and “our” statements, and
27; ;00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:51,140; ;Speaking simply and directly.
28; ;00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:54,340; ;Nothing on this list will surprise sales reps.
29; ;00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:59,100; ;We’ve all been taught to be positive, present, customer-focused and clear.
30; ;00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:07,800; ;What may be less obvious is how deeply these four factors in particular relate to perceptions of trust when you first meet a prospect.
31; ;00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:15,120; ;They often operate on an unconscious level, sending the message to buyers that you’re willing and able to help them.
32; ;00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:20,520; ;Of the four, the one with the greatest impact on trust is speaking simply and directly.
33; ;00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:25,480; ;Researchers measured it by counting the number of “unique words” in each video snippet.
34; ;00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:30,440; ;People who speak simply use a limited vocabulary of everyday words over and over.
35; ;00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:41,120; ;Those who fill their speech with jargon, fillers and qualifiers end up with a higher unique word count, and are perceived as anxious, uncertain or dishonest.
36; ;00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:45,040; ;For example, how much would you trust someone who said this?
37; ;00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:48,600; ;“We would all have to say that mistakes were made in terms of comments.
38; ;00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:55,840; ;I was overenthusiastic in my comments … particularly if you look at them in the context of developments that have taken place.”
39; ;00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:04,660; ;That statement, which of course sounds evasive and dishonest, came from Nixon’s press secretary in 1973, during Watergate.
40; ;00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:07,920; ;You’d trigger the same reaction if you told a prospect,
41; ;00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:18,680; ;“All things being equal, and assuming conditions remain largely in line with current expectations, you can expect to see a reasonable increase in revenues, beginning over the course of 60 to 90 days.”
42; ;00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:25,460; ;Buyers trust straight talk, as in, “You can expect revenues to go up 6% in a couple of months.”
43; ;00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:31,580; ;Now let’s turn to the other three cues that influence trust, starting with negative emotions.
44; ;00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:41,140; ;The research found that words such as “angry,” “sad” and “wrong” undermine perceived trustworthiness, even when the speakers were talking about mundane topics.
45; ;00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:43,280; ;There’s no real surprise there.
46; ;00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:50,460; ;But it’s easy for negative language to creep into conversations with prospects, even when we’re trying to be positive and helpful.
47; ;00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:55,240; ;We might ask, for example, “What would you say is your biggest challenge right now?”
48; ;00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:58,120; ;Or even worse, “What keeps you up at night?”
49; ;00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:03,900; ;Later in a relationship, after you’ve built up a reservoir of trust, you can ask questions like that.
50; ;00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:10,660; ;But in initial encounters, eliciting negative emotions undermines prospects’ confidence in you.
51; ;00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:19,940; ;This finding is consistent with other studies showing that focusing too much on buyers’ fears can increase their anxiety and make them less likely to buy.
52; ;00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:22,640; ;Of course you must discover the buyer’s needs.
53; ;00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:26,100; ;But you can use positive instead of negative language.
54; ;00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:28,880; ;Instead of challenges, ask about opportunities:
55; ;00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,960; ;“If you could do one thing better, what would it be?”
56; ;00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:38,000; ;Instead of asking about the buyer’s “pain,” ask: “What would the ideal outcome look like for you?”
57; ;00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,280; ;Instead of asking what keeps them up at night, find out what would make them sleep better.
58; ;00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:49,640; ;The last two factors -- present tense and fewer I statements – seem to be about mindfulness and focus.
59; ;00:05:49,640 --> 00:06:03,520; ;Citing your track record with other customers, or your own credentials, takes the spotlight off the buyer’s biggest concern – whether you can help him or her right now -- and puts it on what you did for someone else at another time.
60; ;00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:14,500; ;You may think you’re showing your willingness and ability to help the prospect, but the “I” language, and references to past successes, causes the buyer to disconnect and erodes trust.
61; ;00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:16,820; ;Let’s review what we’ve learned today:
62; ;00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:23,920; ;Prospects will make a gut decision – often within the first minute or two -- about whether they trust you enough to continue to engage.
63; ;00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:27,000; ;They’re judging you on two key questions:
64; ;00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,400; ;“Are you willing to help me?” And “are you able to help me?”
65; ;00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:35,980; ;How you structure that first conversation will have a big impact on those answers.
66; ;00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:42,180; ;Research has found four verbal cues that you can use to increase your perceived trustworthiness:
67; ;00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:43,980; ;Avoid negative language.
68; ;00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:47,580; ;Speak in the present tense—focus on the here and now.
69; ;00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:49,220; ;Don’t talk about yourself.
70; ;00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:51,140; ;Keep the focus on your prospect.
71; ;00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:57,060; ;And most important, be direct—use simple language and don’t beat around the bush.
72; ;00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:58,080; ;Thanks for watching.

109; ;00:06:07,984 --> 00:06:10,528; ;This will initiate a request
110; ;00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:12,816; ;to the Park translation team
111; ;00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:16,192; ;who will give you a quote and initiate the translation.
112; ;00:06:16,256 --> 00:06:19,120; ;Once the translation is done, again, you can easily

You also get the extracted text, which you can search.
1; ;00:00:06,130 --> 00:00:25,400; ;Now that you have all of your apps classified, let’s talk about how to leverage policies to automate this process.  Go to the policies tab, you will see a number of predefined policies specifically for Apps Firewall.  These will be enabled based on your workflow.  Here are a few examples:
2; ;00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:30,900; ;Each organization’s workflow can vary, here are a few of the more common ones.
3; ;00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:37,460; ;Company A wants to whitelist a specific list of apps and ban the rest. What does that workflow look like?
4; ;00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:44,760; ;I will start with the assumption that all whitelisted apps have already been trusted and all others have been manually banned.
5; ;00:00:44,760 --> 00:01:12,030; ;First, start with the New Unclassified Apps Installed policy. When active, this policy will raise incidents and take action on any new unclassified apps that get installed in your domain. Then, under response actions, classify app as banned, and send user notification.
6; ;00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:21,900; ;I recommend setting this to notify immediately.
7; ;00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:35,930; ;Add incident status update, set to resolved.
8; ;00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:46,360; ;Once the apps have been classified as banned, they will go into the Revoke Banned Apps policy and will take on the rules of that policy.
9; ;00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:56,530; ;Company B doesn't want to restrict the apps that an employee can access, but has deemed certain access scopes as being risky to the organization.
10; ;00:01:56,530 --> 00:02:04,430; ;Regardless of the app, they want to always ban applications with a certain level of access. What does that workflow look like?
11; ;00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:25,030; ;First, start with the Risky Access Scopes policy. Choose the access scopes that you want to restrict.
12; ;00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:45,230; ;Next, set the response actions Classify app as banned, send end user notification, and set incident status update to resolved.
13; ;00:02:45,230 --> 00:03:07,860; ;Finally, Company C has a lot of custom apps. By using a naming convention and our Trusted Apps by Name policy, you can create a regular expression based on a company naming convention, i.e. “Internal App - [name of app].”
14; ;00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:19,500; ;Response action: classify those apps as trusted, incident status update set to resolve. This can be used in conjunction with some of the other workflows we discussed.
15; ;00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:31,760; ;We have mentioned a few times the power of sending end user notifications. One of the best approaches we have seen is educating the end users and making them a part of the process and solution.
16; ;00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:43,260; ;Consider sharing company policies or best practices, explaining to them why their app was banned, what the next steps are, and what process is in place to request that app if they do need it.
17; ;00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:55,900; ;I’ve seen it work best when times are included in the end user notification emails, such as: “our IT team will get back to you in 24 or 48 hours,” so the user is aware of the next steps.
18; ;00:03:55,900 --> 00:04:13,860; ;You can see that the policies you use and activate are really based on your workflow. To review: step one is establishing a workflow, step two is assigning policies, and step three is a manual review of any incidents that don’t fit into the automated policies.

8; ;00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:41,260; ;Does your organization have a policy around the use of apps? If so, this is a great place to start.
9; ;00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:47,530; ;If you don’t have an acceptable app policy, or would like more information, please contact us to discuss.
10; ;00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:51,640; ;We generally see a couple of different approaches.
11; ;00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:54,200; ;First, take a look at the number of apps.
12; ;00:00:54,200 --> 00:01:00,240; ;From a classification standpoint, there are a few different ways you can start to classify those apps:
13; ;00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:05,660; ;Installed by, access scopes, risk rating and Community Trust Rating.
14; ;00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:13,400; ;As an aside, the Community Trust Rating, CTR, is crowdsourced based on how others in CloudLock have classified the app.
15; ;00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:20,660; ;Start by filtering the “installed by” column, sorting from largest to smallest and focusing on the top 25 installed apps.
16; ;00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:27,620; ;By looking at these top 25, you can identify about 65% of your apps, users, and risk.
17; ;00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:30,960; ;You should see many familiar names and business applications.
18; ;00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,400; ;Often you can start by trusting these applications.
19; ;00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:40,460; ;Check the apps you want to trust.
20; ;00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:48,200; ;Hit the classify button:
21; ;00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:52,700; ;It will give you 3 buttons to start with: banned, trusted, or under audit.
22; ;00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:56,380; ;Click on “trusted”.
23; ;00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:08,840; ;Choose a classification as to why, “required for work” for example, and hit done. Once the apps are classified, the status will change to Trusted and you’re ready to move forward.
24; ;00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:16,060; ;Next, look at a reverse filter starting with apps that are no longer installed or are installed by one user in the company.
25; ;00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:17,920; ;This is the long tail.
26; ;00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:26,260; ;The number of applications is generally large, as is the potential company risk based on the number of apps, but the user impact is minimal.
27; ;00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:32,340; ;Often times, organizations are banning these apps to clean up their environment and to put workflows in place.
28; ;00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:36,520; ;Typically, this accounts for 15-20% of your applications,
29; ;00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:40,400; ;leaving between 15-20% left to classify.
30; ;00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,400; ;Suddenly this is manageable.
31; ;00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:46,020; ;From here, many organizations look at the Risk Score:
32; ;00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:49,820; ;The current system ranks apps from Critical to very low risk.
33; ;00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:57,520; ;This is based on sources such as: Access Scopes, CyberLab intelligence, our Community Trust Rating, and the app category.
34; ;00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:01,960; ;Many organizations start with Critical and High risk apps, and ban those.
35; ;00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:08,440; ;This can also be combined with our community trust rating for applications that you would like to investigate further.
36; ;00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:11,940; ;Another approach is to look at the access scopes.
37; ;00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:17,140; ;Access scopes are the permissions the application is requesting of your Google account.
38; ;00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:27,560; ;Certain scopes such as full data access, manage user activity, and act on behalf of user tend to be higher priority and higher risk for our users.
39; ;00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:33,920; ;The combination of access scopes and the number of access scopes can also increase the risk.
40; ;00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:39,500; ;Another filter to review is apps that have under 50% Community Trust Rating.
41; ;00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:47,320; ;Please note that not all apps will have a Community Trust Rating, it just means the app hasn't been trusted or banned by enough organizations.
42; ;00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:53,620; ;As an aside, you can also restrict an app for a specific person, group or OU.
43; ;00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:57,700; ;This is done by banning an application and adding the exceptions.
44; ;00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:02,200; ;This is a good way to provide an application only to the people that need it.
45; ;00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:09,440; ;The initial goal is to have ALL apps in your environment classified as Trusted, Restricted or Banned.
46; ;00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:17,280; ;Once you have finished the classification and put a workflow together, we can automate the process as new apps enter your environment.
47; ;00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:23,080; ;All apps that are authenticated after the classifications will follow the workflows in place.
48; ;00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:26,660; ;All new apps will show as unclassified.
49; ;00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:32,280; ;Once you have determined your workflow, the next step is to put the policies in place to automate it.
50; ;00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:36,060; ;The next module will provide more detail around automation.
1; ;00:00:05,847 --> 00:00:13,906; ;Now that you have a better understanding of what Data Loss Prevention consists of, let’s take a look at how to create those policies.
2; ;00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:18,022; ;To create a policy, follow the steps we will be covering today.
3; ;00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:22,355; ;From the policies tab choose Add a Policy:
4; ;00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:26,088; ;Here you will see several choices to create policies.
5; ;00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,977; ;Let’s start with a predefined policy.
6; ;00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:40,155; ;You can narrow the policies with location or industry filters, or simply click select policy to view all the Predefined Policies available.
7; ;00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:47,200; ;In this example, we will create a policy to search for ABA Routing Numbers.
8; ;00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,200; ;Choose a severity level.
9; ;00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:56,088; ;The severity level controls how an incident generated by the policy is displayed in the CloudLock interface.
10; ;00:00:56,080 --> 00:01:06,488; ;The severity is meant to influence the priority given to incidents by security admins, but will not affect the way the policy behaves.
11; ;00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:13,422; ;Click on configure policy and the content configuration tab appears.
12; ;00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:20,533; ;The main Regex or content criteria is the pattern match CloudLock needs to find in a file to raise an incident.
13; ;00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:23,444; ;In this case, it is based on a regular expression,
14; ;00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:29,600; ;however other policies may display the content criteria in the form of a redacted algorithm.
15; ;00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,444; ;Next select Threshold.
16; ;00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:41,244; ;Threshold tells the policy how many minimum matches of the content criteria CloudLock must find in a file before raising an incident.
17; ;00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:51,511; ;For example, if there’s one ABA routing number in a file, that may be okay, but if there’s five or more, that’s cause for an incident.
18; ;00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:53,755; ;Next, click on proximity:
19; ;00:01:53,750 --> 00:02:06,311; ;The proximity setting is an optional regular expression containing keywords that have to be found within 100 terms or in the same row or column of a spreadsheet as the detected content.
20; ;00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:16,577; ;In many predefined policies, the Proximity will be pre-populated, as it is here, but you can always edit this field depending on your needs.
21; ;00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:20,088; ;Let’s continue to the Context tab:
22; ;00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:24,466; ;The Platform setting defines the platform the policy applies to.
23; ;00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:35,288; ;This allows you to create one policy across multiple platforms or break out different policies by platform.
24; ;00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:48,688; ;The File Type is the type of file the policy applies to. For example, any policy can be narrowed down to only monitor specific file extensions.
25; ;00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:55,933; ;File Size: allows you to limit your results to files larger than a minimum file size.
26; ;00:02:55,930 --> 00:03:03,111; ;By not selecting any file size you would be monitoring all the files on the environment.
27; ;00:03:06,777 --> 00:03:16,688; ;Object Type is a setting specific to Salesforce customers. This setting allows you to include or exclude specific object types in your environment.
28; ;00:03:18,888 --> 00:03:33,311; ;Ownership : refers to the users, groups, or OUs to which the policy applies. In certain cases, you may only want to look for ABA Routing Numbers in files owned by members of your Finance Department.
29; ;00:03:38,333 --> 00:03:50,155; ;For other organizations, you may want to exempt members of your Finance Department from the ABA Routing Number policy, as they are allowed to store that type of information in the cloud.
30; ;00:03:56,288 --> 00:04:01,111; ;Lastly Exposure : how and with whom files are shared.
31; ;00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:07,933; ;Choose the exposure level based on the platforms that you have in your platform setup.
32; ;00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:12,133; ;For each platform if all of the exposures settings are left blank,
33; ;00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:19,755; ;the policy will raise an incident any time it finds a match for the content criteria, regardless of how the file is shared.
34; ;00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:27,088; ;When you check off specific exposures, the policy will respect your choices,
35; ;00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:35,377; ;and that policy will only raise incidents for files that contain the content AND are shared in this way.
36; ;00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:47,755; ;Once you’ve identified your policy detection criteria, confirm it looks good in the Summary tab, and go ahead and click Save All Changes.
37; ;00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:54,133; ;The policy will start scanning your environment, detecting violations and triggering incidents.
38; ;00:04:54,130 --> 00:05:01,711; ;In addition to the Predefined Policies CloudLock offers, you can build your own custom policies.
39; ;00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:04,644; ;Choose the policy type that will apply:
40; ;00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:13,222; ;A context-only policy detects files or objects according to their size, type, ownership, and exposure.
41; ;00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:24,488; ;The content is not even considered in context-only policies. These are typically used when you want to identify all files that are shared in a certain way, publicly, for example.
42; ;00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:27,866; ;Next is a Custom Regex policy
43; ;00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:34,688; ;A Custom Regex policy raises incidents that match a pattern using a regular expression in the Python flavor.
44; ;00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:45,244; ;This is a good choice to look for organization-specific keywords or phrases in files, such as confidential project names or intellectual property.
45; ;00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:48,844; ;The other policy types will be covered in different modules.
1; ;00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:18,960; ;Now that you have a basic understanding of CloudLock’s core use cases, let’s learn how to protect your users and accounts using our UEBA, User Entity and Behavior Analytics, solution.
2; ;00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,200; ;Start with the activities tab on the left side.
3; ;00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:32,780; ;The activities tab is your raw feed of all activity happening on the platforms that you have CloudLock coverage for, surfacing down below in chronological order.
4; ;00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:47,060; ;This activities tab is independent of any policies you have set up, and starts with a high level map of where you have activity coming from, followed by filters to narrow down the list of events below.
5; ;00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:57,640; ;Each event includes information about, the user, the triggering Asset, the IP address, detection date, and country.
6; ;00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:01,120; ;Where the event is coming from.
7; ;00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:05,640; ;For additional forensics, you can drill into the raw event data.
8; ;00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:21,280; ;When you are first getting started, you want to use this activities tab as a way to build your baseline and start to understand what typical behavior is in your environment.
9; ;00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:29,000; ;You can also go back and reference the activities tab for additional details and deeper post incident analysis.
10; ;00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:39,160; ;Once you have a good handle on your baseline, start to map out different scenarios that would represent anomalous behavior that you would want to be alerted on via policy.
11; ;00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:51,240; ;Note, any of the policies that we’re talking about as they relate to Users and accounts are going to fall under the policy's tab under the type - Event Analysis.
12; ;00:01:53,240 --> 00:02:00,160; ;You can customize and activate an existing Event Analysis policy or build your own.
13; ;00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:04,500; ;Either option will give you the same policy detection criteria to work with.
14; ;00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:08,600; ;Let’s build our own Event Analysis policy today.
15; ;00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:18,120; ;Choose that policy type event analysis, choose a severity level, and configure your policy.
16; ;00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:33,820; ;When configuring each policy, keep in mind all of the detection criteria is “and-ed” together, so it's extremely important to be careful in selecting this criteria to make sure you're creating a scenario that will raise incidents.
17; ;00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:37,900; ;Lets talk through what each of the different detection criteria means.
18; ;00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:48,520; ;Starting with ‘Platform’, you can choose to create one policy across all platforms you have CloudLock coverage for, or create platform-specific policies.
19; ;00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:54,940; ;In certain scenarios, it makes sense to monitor anomalous behavior across multiple platforms.
20; ;00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:04,440; ;The ‘Country detection’ criteria gives you the ability to either whitelist or blacklist certain countries from which activity might be coming from.
21; ;00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:10,520; ;A whitelisted approach is usually best for organizations that have home bases in less than 3 countries.
22; ;00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:21,960; ;For example,  I am a business that is based in the United States, and United Kingdom, and I don’t expect my users to be working outside of those two countries.
23; ;00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:28,960; ;If I see any activity coming from outside the United States or the United Kingdom, that would be considered anomalous.
24; ;00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:32,960; ;An alternate option is the blacklisted approach.
25; ;00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:49,180; ;If I am a global organization that regularly has activity coming from multiple countries at the same time, I may choose to blacklist a list of countries, ultimately creating a policy that will read “If I see any activity coming from blacklisted countries, I will receive an alert.”
26; ;00:03:51,100 --> 00:04:01,460; ;Next is the ‘Events’ criteria allows you to select if the policy is going to monitor for all events on their platform or specific events.
27; ;00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:05,140; ;Selecting the Event Type presents you with several options.
28; ;00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:17,280; ;‘Events by platform (normalized)’ is a way for CloudLock to match each platform's specific events to normalized categories, making it easier for you to create one policy across multiple platforms.
29; ;00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:26,940; ;Another option is to look through the raw events for each category and self select which events you want to be alerted on per platform.
30; ;00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:33,260; ;You can click on ‘name’ to alphabetize the events to make it easier to select.
31; ;00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:36,720; ;Next we are going to skip over and tackle ‘Users.’
32; ;00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:47,640; ;For each policy, consider who should be monitored, for example: all of the users in my environment, or specific users, groups, or OUs.
33; ;00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:58,880; ;If lets say, you have most end users coming from the United States or the United Kingdom as mentioned before, except for a group of sales reps that are often traveling.
34; ;00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:07,400; ;You may want to exclude the sales reps from this particular policy and create a separate policy to monitor their specific behavior patterns.
35; ;00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:15,480; ;Next we have ‘Whitelisted IPs.
36; ;00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:23,380; ;By enabling your trusted IP library the policy will not to trigger on activity coming from these IPs.
37; ;00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:29,040; ;You can choose to whitelist all IPs within your trusted IP library, or specific IPs.
38; ;00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:41,880; ;The 'Blacklisted IPs' criteria allows you to create a policy that will trigger on events coming from blacklisted IPs.
39; ;00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:49,480; ;When you check off blacklisted IPs, you want to make sure that this is it's own policy just coupled with events here.
40; ;00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:53,960; ;There are two different blacklisted IP feeds that you can take advantage of in Cloudlock.
41; ;00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:58,440; ;The first is CloudLock Cyberlab Suspicious IP Feed.
42; ;00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:04,040; ;This feed is populated with known suspicious IPs through our extensive research.
43; ;00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:08,180; ;The second checkbox here is for your own suspicious IP library.
44; ;00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:14,800; ;Let’s say there’s a scenario where you see some strange activity coming from an IP address you don't recognize.
45; ;00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:35,420; ;Upon further investigation, you realize that this was a potential threat coming into your environment, and although you handled the threat, you may want to add the IP address to your suspicious IP library so that moving forward if there is any additional activity coming from that IP, you'll be able to capture it in this blacklisted IP policy.
46; ;00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:44,740; ;Again, similar to whitelisted IPs, you can blacklist your entire suspicious IP library, or cherry pick the specific ones that apply.
47; ;00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:51,100; ;The last detection criteria that I want to touch on is the 'Velocity'.
48; ;00:06:51,100 --> 00:07:11,880; ;The velocity trigger monitors for geographically distant pairs of events coming from a single user account. So if you have a user logging in from Salesforce at 10am EST from the US, and that same user downloads a file from Google Drive at 10:05 am from Australia, that would trigger the velocity policy if enabled.
49; ;00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:21,200; ;I recommend starting with the default settings, and if you feel you are getting hits too close to your home base or too many false positives, you can always up the distance threshold.
50; ;00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:28,620; ;I saved the 'Velocity' trigger for last, because it really should be its own policy coupled with events.
51; ;00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:37,380; ;Once you've created the policy that makes sense for your use case click ‘Save All Changes’, and you’re good to go!
52; ;00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:46,420; ;Once that policy is active in your environment, you’ll start to receive incidents based on behavior that meets that policy criteria.
53; ;00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:50,180; ;We will address incident behavior in another module.
1; ;00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:07,140; ;Need to quickly conference with two people? While on a live call in Virtual Office, press the “Add Call” button.
2; ;00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:15,780; ;You will be able to search your contacts or dial a phone number. Once you have found the person you would like to add to the call, press the + sign next to their name.
3; ;00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:18,960; ;The person you are on the call with will be put on hold.

3; ;00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,540; ;So that makes my brain hurt.

We're gonna learn a little bit about Organic Chemistry and our components.  And what I like about Rich's approach is it [unintelligible] understandable.  So he will be calling on people, right. And there are prizes to be had, so make sure that your name tag is out. Be prepared, so good luck and see you on the flip side.
5; ;00:00:51,120 --> 00:01:53,600; ;Okay good morning. I'm Rich Cherpeck; I'm a chemist; I work here in Richmond. My main job is inventing new fuel additives. The owner of the current patent's [unintelligible], so being a chemist has always been fun to me. And again let me see the number of people in here that have taken college chemisty. Okay so most of you guys, that's good. Okay and then let me see, anybody in here that has never taken chemistry at all? Okay your job is when I start talking about too much chemistry, you need to say "I don't get it, step back". There's no bad "I don't get it" things; all questions are good questions. I appreciate the questions. As Abby said, if people are quiet and don't ask questions, I will ask questions.
6; ;00:01:53,600 --> 00:05:30,920; ;So it's a one or two way thing. So this morning what I'm really trying to accomplish is: one, why am I a chemist? So basically I'm a chemist because I like doing puzzles. Chemistry is not something where the general public thinks...what does the general public think a chemist is? Anybody? What do chemists do? Come on. So what the general public thinks chemists do is they walk around in white lab coats, they have test tubes hanging out of their ears and every four years they have to run over to Sweden to pick up their Nobel Prize. And believe me, that's not how it is. But what chemistry is there's a lot of give and take and learning and not learning. And it's like why am I chemist? Because I like solving puzzles.  And a lot of chemistry is making something, understanding what it does and then it's very rarely what you want it to be, but incorporating that knowledge into making the next step in the sequence until we come up with a new product. Okay new products are extremley important to this business. All of the engine technology you're going to see, a lot of the engine technology is changing. And every time it changes it introduces new problems, and we need to react to those with our product sight.  If we want to be the best additive company, we have to have the best performing additives. And we need to understand the changes that are occurring and then have our chemistry react to those in order to solve those problems. Another thing is chemistry is a very fertile area. There is no such thing as a perfect chemical out there. I mean I presume you've all seen the drug apps on TV. This compound here gets rid of your headache but it causes...then there's 5 minutes of nonsense saying it does this, this, this and this. Well that's the same thing that's true with additives. Additives do certain things and they do them very well, but there is no perfect additive. Especially when something even gets close to perfect, the technology of the engines change and it introduces a whole bunch more problems. So one of the reasons I'm a chemist is job security. There's never such a thing as a perfect chemical. What I want to give you this morning, a lot of people don't like chemistry because the first part of chemistry, in all chemistry courses it's a language thing. You're being taught a foreign language. There's lots of names of various things and you have to memorize them. But that's not the fun part of chemistry. The fun part part of chemistry is the understanding part; understanding why certain things do certain things. And that's what I'm going to try to give to you this morning is why certain additives, what function they provide in the products we sell. And why they do that. And I think it's important for you to get some of those things.  And because it gives you a better understanding, instead of a blue bottle with some additives in there of what that stuff in that blue bottle really does. The other thing about the chemistry aspects is if you have these things in the blue bottle, they do good things, they do bad things. And we have formulators who you'll see are subsequent to me whose job is totally to put the things together to get the best with the least problems associated with the chemicals.
7; ;00:05:33,360 --> 00:07:40,400; ;So the first thing I'm going to do about this morning, I said chemistry is a new language. And chemists use pictures. It's basically an easy way to portray things that you'd take many words to do. And I'm just going to go over some of those pictures with you, and you don't have to understand everything. Because I'll use pictures later on to give you a feeling for what that means and what that really represents. Then I'm going to go through the various chemicals that we have and I'm going to talk about why they behave the way they behave. And there's two simple concepts that you should get when we're done here. First of all oil is a very, what we call non-polar liquid. If you take oil and water, they do not mix. And we live in an aqueous world; our bodies are made out of water, most everything is associated with water. Well, water and oil don't mix. So we have a media that's opposite to the major part of the world. So we have to have the things, the chemicals, soluble and working in that media. And so polarity and how we get things that work in water that work in oil, a very important concept. The other thing is in chemistry, chemistry can be very simple. It's like charged things, and by charged I mean it either has lots of electrons or few electrons, react with each other. And if they're light charges they repel, and if they're opposite charges they attract. And if you get that and you can look at a chemical and figure out where's the positive and negative, the charges, you can predict what any reaction's going to do. And so we're going to have additives and I'm going to try to incorporate that.  So two concepts: polarity -- how do you dissolve stuff? And charges because that's going to do the working part of what the additive does.
8; ;00:07:40,400 --> 00:08:03,140; ;Okay and the last thing here is this is totally focused on lubricant and additive chemistry. And I'll try to relate some of these things to what is in the normal world. Everybody here has heard of an antioxidant? Is that true? Not true? Who hasn't heard of an antioxidant?
9; ;00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:04,760; ;Well we're going to get into that, right Rick?
10; ;00:08:04,760 --> 00:09:52,780; ;Right. Okay and so some of this pertains to what happens to you. Okay so first of all I'm going to show you a little bit about the drawings and what these drawings mean. Who can tell me what this is? Theresa, come on yeah. What is it? It's ethanol okay. That's the chemist's depiction of what ethanol is. All these thins that are next to it are representations of the same thing. Chemists basically want to get to the point really quick and don't want to waste a lot of time doing it. And so what do we do? We have drawings and we portray them. You can't see ethanol. If I hold up ethanol you don't know what it looks like. This is if you had a model of it. And you can out in space, this is what ethanol really does look like. And the black things in here are carbons, and C stands for carbon so that's this portion of it. The white things are hydrogens, and that's the H part in there; and the big red thing is Oxygen. Okay so if you see that, that's what ethanol would really look like. If I show you this, what is this? So there's a red thing in the middle, and there's two H's associated with it. So H2O, what is H2O?
11; ;00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:53,540; ;Water.
12; ;00:09:53,540 --> 00:11:56,720; ;Water, yeah. And so that's the way the chemists depict these things. So basically for a chemical drawing if there's a Carbon with 3 Hydrogens, the first thing that you typically do is you take out the Carbons. And you take and draw those line structures. So every Carbon is now just replaced with an intersection, a line. Okay, there's a Carbon, there's Carbon, an OH. Carbon, carbon OH. And the next thing you do is just remove the Hydrogens attached to the Carbons. And so if I take all these away and it's just understood that they're there, because Carbon always has 4 things bonded to it, you get a drawing that looks like this. So that's the CH3. That's the CH2, and that's the Oxygen and the Hydrogen. So everything you see is drawn like this, but it really represents this. Okay? If you look at this down here, it's the same thing. Carbons are connected to Carbons and there can be more than one bond between them. So there's a Carbon to Carbon double bond, and if I look at this and I remove the Carbons and I just draw it like that, you can see every place there was a Carbon there's just an intersection. Everybody with me? Okay. And then I just took away the Hydrogens, so you see all these Hydrogens went away. And you get something that's much simpler and much easier to depict. It is always names associated with things. Like when I said this was ethanol, a lot of people on the street just call that booze, okay? And water is a slang term, it's not the chemical name for water. So I'm going to draw something up here and then I'm going to call on a volunteer to convert what I've drawn up here into what I'm calling a line drawing.
13; ;00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:05,220; ;[unintelligible]
14; ;00:12:05,220 --> 00:13:14,680; ;I'm sorry? Okay so there's a...to make this fun, there's a prize for whoever can do this for me. Okay, so I need a volunteer. Theresa, get up here!  That's too bad. So convert that to the line drawing for me. So what are you going to do? I've already converted the lines, the Carbons, I've taken most of them away. Okay? And then she's going to remove the Hydrogens. And then's going to have a drawing up there.
15; ;00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:34,960; ;Okay so see, see what you did? All the Hydrogens are gone. So it's a simplistic representation of this.
16; ;00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:36,960; ;And do you know what that's called?
17; ;00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:47,700; ;This is [unintelligible]. It is [unintelligible].
18; ;00:13:47,700 --> 00:14:00,840; ;Okay it's... Aspirine. It's aspirine. So it's acetycelsic acid, but you'd call it aspirin. You can have a prize.
19; ;00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:05,000; ;So Theresa tell everybody what's your name?
20; ;00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,980; ;I'm Theresa, Theresa [unintelligible].
21; ;00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:08,420; ;And what do you do?
22; ;00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:11,960; ;I'm a research chemist and I work on the [unintelligible].
23; ;00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:22,580; ;Okay.
24; ;00:14:22,580 --> 00:16:37,000; ;So as you change things, as you add more. So this has got how many Carbons? Four. One, two, three, four. This has twice as many, it's 8. This has twice as many as that, it's 16. This has twice as many. And look what happens, when you have fewer Carbons, this is a gas. Okay when you double the size of it, it's a liquid, it's gasoline. If you double the size of that, it becomes even more thicker, and even closer to an oily substance, then it's diesel. It's diesel fuel. If you add more Carbons, it starts to become waxy.  So you go from gases, to liquids, to thicker liquids, to waxes. And then when you add lots of carbons, it becomes a solid. It's a plastic, it's what's called a polymer. But it's plastic, it's large. And why is that? That's what I really want you guys to get out of that.  If I had a box here, the same size box, and I put 10 of these in this small box that I have, they don't interact with each other. And they stay in the gas phase. They don't touch each other, they don't do things because they're small and there's a big volume in the box.  But if I put this in there, they come into contact with each other more often. And when you do that, you go from a gas to a liquid. Okay, and if you put a lot of them in there the liquid gets thicker. And if you put them in there in an array and they can't move around at all, it becomes waxes or solids. So the size will tell you how some of the properties of the composition of what you have is If you have few Carbons, it's going to be a gas. And the more you add, the more the properties change.
25; ;00:16:37,000 --> 00:17:14,120; ;So the shapes of things also have an impact on what they look like in 3 dimensional space. So we've all heard about fatty acids. And they say "don't eat certain ones", "certain ones are good for you" and that and so forth. So what fatty acids do they tell you not to eat because they're not good for you? I need a volunteer to answer this; there's a prize involved. Saturated, who said that? Good, come on up here.
26; ;00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:17,500; ;[unintelligible]
27; ;00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:29,440; ;No, chemists can participate. But you're not getting the prize until you answer another question. Okay, what about trans fatty acids?
28; ;00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:35,220; ;Trans fatty acids, well those are bad as well. Because you don't have the enzymes in your body to break them down.
29; ;00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:38,700; ;Well that's partly true. Okay and what about cis fatty acids?
30; ;00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:48,460; ;Cis fatty acids, they're liquids at room temperature. They're also more likely soluble with liquids in your body and therefore they don't clog your arteries and your body has the enzymes to break them down.
31; ;00:17:48,460 --> 00:18:09,340; ;Correct. And so if you get something that's clogging up your arteries, so it starts turning into a solid, it's going to clog it up. If it stays in the liquid phase, it doesn't clog it up. It's not that complicated, it's the way it is.  Okay, I'm not done with you yet. You're not getting your prize that easy.
32; ;00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:11,800; ;All right, that's fine.
33; ;00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,760; ;What kind of fatty acid is this?
34; ;00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,200; ;That's a cis fatty acid.
35; ;00:18:15,200 --> 00:19:09,340; ;So there's a carbon-carbon bond in this, and it's a cis fatty acid. And you see the cis fatty acid, the one that says unsaturated on the bottom, see the liquid to it? And why is this one liquid? Well remember I said if you force things in this box and you have chemical interactions, the more you restrict the rotation, the less they'll be able to move. So if this guy can hardly interact with another one, because it's all bent up, okay? These guys can interact with each other. And when they interact with each other it basically compacts them into space, you have solids. So it's pretty straight forward and simple. Thanks, Greg. And what's your job?
36; ;00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:15,620; ;I'm an analytical chemist for fuel technology and additives.
37; ;00:19:15,620 --> 00:20:06,920; ;Now so anybody can come up. I mean with free prizes you guys should be running up here. Okay so the shape, this thing and this they all have, if you look at the carbons, they all have the same number of carbons.  They all have relatively the same number of hydrogens, the ones with double bonds, the cis one, has two less. But that's not what's impacting their properties: it's the shape that they're in. And certain carbon double bonds don't allow free rotation about them. And so it restricts this to shape, and the shape it restricts it in allows it to be a liquid all the time.
38; ;00:20:06,920 --> 00:21:09,640; ;So far we've got size matters for the properties, shape matters for the properties. Okay and now I'm going to talk about polarity. I just said oils and water aren't missable, right? So if you get grease on your plate at your house and you pour water over it, what happens? Come on what happens? How do you get the grease off the plate? You have to put soap into the water. You can run water over the grease all day and nothing's happening. But when you stick something in there you can solubilize it. And that's a lot like what our additives do. We have deposits in engines that aren't soluble in oil, and by introducing the additive, the additive can make them soluble. So it's the ability of the additive to interact with those things to give it those properties.
39; ;00:21:09,640 --> 00:22:59,340; ;Okay so there are certain things that make organic chemicals polar, and there are certain things that make them non polar. So non polar, polar.  The non-polar things are basically just made up of...what is oil made up of? Carbon and hydrogen. There's very little bit of any other things, and that's non-polar. So things with carbon and hydrogens are non-polar. Things with other types of atoms in it are polar. Okay and so if that's the case, we have a media that's like this, but we really live in a world with like water and sodium chloride, and all of these various metals and things that looks like that. So one of the major challenges of lubricating oil additives is how do you correlate those to each other and how to use the polar functionality in an oil environment.  So here it is again, here's a picture. Like things, if it's polar, like things, polar things dissolve in water.  Polar things dissolve in water, non polar things dissolve in oil. And the additive helps change the things that which it's soluble in. So if you have a deposit in an engine and you want it to be soluble in the oil, it's just like a soap.  It's gotta interact with the deposit particle and carry that deposit particle back into the oil.
40; ;00:22:59,340 --> 00:24:06,180; ;How do we do that? Okay what we do for a soap is we take something that's soluble in the water and we take the grease with something that's soluble in the grease. And if you take something that's soluble in the grease and the opposite end is soluble in the water, the grease gets surrounded by the things that it's like, the greasy stuff, and the other end it exposed is the part that's soluble in the water. So you take the grease and it goes into the water because the compound that's called the soap has two parts to that. And those two parts are having something that's soluble in water, this is what I'm calling here is a polar head, and something that's soluble in the grease, which is the non-polar end. So you have a molecule with both types of functionality and allows those two to be soluble in each other.
41; ;00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:35,780; ;Okay, anybody have an idea what this is? Come on, wake up. What is that? It's a detergent, exactly. Correct. You get a prize. So it's detergent, and why is this a detergent? Because first of all what's your name?
42; ;00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:36,740; ;Charles.
43; ;00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:37,860; ;Okay, and what do you do?
44; ;00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:41,380; ;[unintelligible]
45; ;00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:43,280; ;So are you a chemical engineer?
46; ;00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:44,260; ;Yes.
47; ;00:24:44,260 --> 00:26:32,160; ;Okay. Chemical engineers are okay. Go ahead. So we have something here, and what's the polar end of this? The part that's not containing just carbon and hydrogens. But it's this, and this is the part that's soluble in the water and this is the part that's soluble in the grease on your plate. Okay and so if you have this that's soluble in the grease, then the outside of this thing looks all like this and the water thinks it's just something polar; it tricked it. And that's how you solubilize the grease into the water. So the other portion of this then needs to interact with things.  Okay and I said it could interact with deposit particles, but it also needs to interact with other things.  And there's certain things that it's going to be attracted to. And I need two people up here. I want somebody that's big, and looks big and strong, and somebody that's small. So I need two volunteers up here. Or I'll just pick somebody, I can use my own judgement. But I'm giving you this opportunity. Okay a big person, come on. Stand up. Mike, he's tall. Aren't you semi-tall? Okay come on up here. I need somebody that's short. I'm gonna make you all stand up and I'm gonna pick someone.
48; ;00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:34,580; ;[unintelligible]
49; ;00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:44,960; ;Um no that's my surprise, this is... So Jessica come on up here.
50; ;00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,700; ;You've been looking at me for over two minutes.
51; ;00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:51,140; ;Well I was just kind of trying to, it's hard to size people up.
52; ;00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:52,460; ;I'm almost insulted that you're calling me short.
53; ;00:26:52,460 --> 00:27:48,540; ;No insult to you. Okay. So okay I'm gonna make this. So you're the big guy here, okay. And I'm gonna take, what are these things? Magnets, okay.  If you can understand magnets, you can understand chemistry. So if I take the same ends of the magnets, I labeled this one as minus because I'm going to depict this as a minus charge, and I bring it to the other magnet, with the same charge what happens? Yeah, let's give it to this big strong guy here and ask him to put these things together. So put the negatives to the negatives. No, no. You barely, ahh no. Okay let's give this little weak person over here.
54; ;00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:50,380; ;Do you want me to act?
55; ;00:27:50,380 --> 00:28:46,480; ;No, I'm gonna take...[unintelligible]. So we're going to see who's stronger, all right? So you can take these and put them together like this. And I want you to do this and see how easy this was.  See that was easy. She didn't have that much of a hard time, he did. Why? Because like things repel each other, opposite things attract.  And that's not that complicated, but that's how chemicals are too. The most positive thing always reacts with the most negative thing.  And the same thing with additive interactions, it's additives' actions are based on. Causing that kind of reaction to occur and then solubilizing the products back into the oil. Okay you both can have prizes even though you weren't [unintelligible] as strong.
56; ;00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:57,860; ;[unintelligible]
57; ;00:28:57,860 --> 00:29:30,720; ;Okay so again what do we do with these additives? We have a polar thing that does all the work, that does all the chemistry and we have something attached to it that helps solubilize it into oil. Or is able to just at least take this thing and make it soluble in the oil. So now that I've given you the fundamentals and the background. And what are the two fundamentals again?
58; ;00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:47,380; ;I'm just gonna call on somebody. Sean, stand up. And your name is Sean McGinness?
59; ;00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:47,920; ;Yes.
60; ;00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:49,240; ;And what do you do?
61; ;00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:51,100; ;[unintelligible]
62; ;00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:58,820; ;And so what are the two things that are important for designing new additives?
63; ;00:29:58,820 --> 00:30:01,040; ;Whether or not they're polar.
64; ;00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:01,400; ;Right.
65; ;00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:06,700; ;And the second one was whether or not they're [unintelligible].
66; ;00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:48,560; ;They can react with each other and the charge attraction.  The one he said, the first thing is the polarity. In other words, how do you solubilize things into oil? How do you make the functional part of the additive soluble? The other part is the functional part. And there just like the little magnets, the opposite ends attract, the like ends they fly apart. So if you don't want things to stick to each other and you make them the same charge, well if they're the same charge they're not coming together. And that's an important design feature and an important aspect to a lot of how our additives function.
67; ;00:30:48,560 --> 00:31:22,360; ;Okay. Did I lose the microphone for some reason? Hello? What happened? I don't know what happened. Did the battery go? It says battery. [unintelligible]
68; ;00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:25,960; ;This thing better not dislike chemistry.
69; ;00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:32,020; ;[unintelligible]
70; ;00:31:32,020 --> 00:33:43,720; ;So we have a variety...can everybody hear me okay? We have a variety of things that are in our additive packages, that are in lubricating oil. And this is kind of a list of what they are. I'm going to need to stand here so that I can, too many things. Okay and we have things that impact the wear and durability of an engine. And what everybody, what's the common oil drain interval? When I was a kid you always had to change the oil every 3,000 miles, right? That's what the recommended dosage was. But if you have a newer car, how often do they tell you to change the oil? 6,000, 10,000; it keeps getting longer, okay? And for that to occur, what do you have to do?  The oil has to...um hello? The oil has to last longer. And also it's gotta be more stable, and what it's gotta be stable to is what degrades oil is oxidation.  And what is oxidation? Oxidation is the introduction of oxygen atoms into a hydrocarbon. So in some cases, we want things to oxidize.  We burn gasoline, and when we burn gasoline [unintelligible] when we burn gasoline we want it to react with oxygen because oxidation is a heat-releasing kind of reaction. And when you release heat you can get energy from the fuel. In other words when you have a cold space and in becomes hot you generate some kind of force. So when we have gasoline and we burn it up, we want it to release a lot of small molecules-- in this case CO2.  It creates pressure and it releases heat. And that forces in the case of a car a piston to move. Okay I'm gonna move.
71; ;00:33:43,720 --> 00:35:03,020; ;Okay so in other cases we want the oil, the lubricating oil in the car, to stay perfectly intact.  We don't want it to go away. And that's why because of the newer oils, that are called synthetic oils, that are less reactive to oxidation reactions, by being less reactive to oxidation reactions they last longer. They've gone from 3,000 miles, 6,000 miles, 10,000 miles and it keeps getting higher. But the additives can do the same thing to the oil. And the additives also play a role in accomplishing that. And we have things up here that are there for the oil protection called antioxidants.  And you have antioxidants in food, and remember when I said at the beginning what are the purpose of those antioxidants. Well the purpose of the antioxidants you eat for health purposes is to keep the things in your body from oxidizing. Because oxidizing degrades things. When you have oil oxidizing causes the formation of reactive chemicals.  And if you have something that's C20 and it reacts with another C20, it gets twice as big. And if it gets bigger, what does that do to the oil? Speak up.
72; ;00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:03,820; ;It becomes a solid.
73; ;00:35:03,820 --> 00:38:22,820; ;Yeah, it goes towards a solid. First it becomes viscous, okay so it becomes bigger.  And as it gets bigger and bigger and bigger, it starts to become and starts to oxidize further, it starts to get converted into deposits. Deposits are polar so they go to the metal surfaces, they stick to the metal surfaces and they are not floating around. And they cause all kinds of problems. So we've gone from a liquid to a thicker liquid. And when you increase the viscosity of the oil, it's no longer as good as a friction modifier; it no longer decreases friction because the moving parts are moving across something thick it's harder for them to move. If moving parts are moving across a media that's thin, it's easy for them to move. So oxidation in the fuel is fantastic, we want it to occur 100%. Oxidation in the oil is bad news. Okay so we have things in there called antioxidants. And all these things, pretty much the detergents and the [unintelligible] are to take out the products you get via oxidation.  And I'm gonna go through each of these in a lot more detail, but this is just to give you a general overview of what the additive chemistry is in there. There are certain things that are anti-wear additives. If you take one metal, and a metal surface is not flat, it doesn't look like this table; but on a molecular level it's very jagged. There's all kinds of peaks and valleys in there. And when those peaks rub against each other the metals move across, what happens to the metal? That peak gets sheared off. And now you're getting wear in your engine.  So we have additives in the oil that sit on top of the metal surface to make it actually harder, so that when the things rub against each other they don't take a chunk of the metal away. And those things are called anti-wear additives.  Okay and then the whole purpose of the lubricant in the first place is to reduce friction. You want to facilitate metal parts moving across metal parts.  And we put things in the oil that decreases friction. So if you have these things that are going to rub against each other, we have to put things in the oil to prevent that from happening. Okay, and the things that we put in oil to do that are called friction modifiers And the things that we add to oil to keep it in the low viscosity range, and but the oil has to be the same viscosity at all temperatures. If you start your car up in the morning, you don't want the oil to be very, very thick. If you do, your car won't start. So you want the oil to be thin. But if it's an extremely hot day, you don't want the oil to be so thin that it's volatilizing out of there and not doing much. And so you want it to be thicker. So we put things in there that are called viscosity modifiers that will change the viscosity of an oil. All these things are predominantly the things that we have for the oil.
74; ;00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:29,580; ;[unintelligible]
75; ;00:38:29,580 --> 00:39:38,860; ;Okay the first thing I'm going to go over in a little more detail is oxidation. And oxidation again, and wear and durability additives as a whole, is how do you stop things that you put in the oil. And the oil is a very harsh environment. By harsh, I'm saying there's a lot of chemically reactive that comes in there. And where do the chemically reactive things come from? Well, one, to burn gasoline requires oxygen.  And when you have oxygen and carbon, you want it to go to CO2 to get the most efficiency.  But it always doesn't go to CO2. Some of it goes to reactive chemicals, and those reactive chemicals react with each other and they cause changes to the oil. And so what we want to do then is make the oil that so it can deal with that phenomena.
76; ;00:39:38,860 --> 00:40:20,740; ;Okay, so what do antioxidants do? They stop oxidation.  Just like I said you take, for human health benefits, you take antioxidants. And when you take those antioxidants you try to keep the parts of your body from getting oxidized.  Here we're trying to keep the oil from getting oxidized. If we did that a 100%, would we have the problem solved? Yes or no? Would we have oil that lasts forever if we could stop oxidation totally? Thomas, what do you think?
77; ;00:40:20,740 --> 00:41:38,220; ;Yeah. Try again. No, and the answer why is that, well we've certainly made progress and that's what we've done by prolonging the oil drain intervals.  We've gone to oxidatively more stable oils, the synthetics. Okay, but we can't solve a problem because we have gasoline that is burning. And the gasoline gets partially burnt, and then the piston comes up and pulls that partially burned gasoline into the oil. And those products are about the same as if you oxidize the oil. So we gotta to continue a supply of pouring oxidized products into the oil, because of the burning of the fuel. So even if I gave you the world's best antioxidant, you still don't have the problem solved. It's more complicated than that. It's job security, okay? And what these things do is require other things. They require detergents and dispersants. And a lot of the things that are oxidation products are acids. And what happens when you contact a metal surface with acids?
78; ;00:41:38,220 --> 00:41:39,460; ;Corrosion?
79; ;00:41:39,460 --> 00:41:48,220; ;Yep, corrosion. You've got it. Eva, get a prize. First of all, what do you do?
80; ;00:41:48,220 --> 00:41:49,900; ;I'm an IT.
81; ;00:41:49,900 --> 00:43:08,160; ;You're an IT? And why is that important to inventing new additives? Why would that be important to adding new additives? I'm a chemist here. Every single person in this room does some job that's important to inventing new compounds. And I'm interested in inventing new commercial products. That's my job, okay. And so in your role, why is that important to me inventing new compounds? You're looking puzzled. I'm telling you, in chemistry remember I just showed you those models.  And in chemistry, if you can't see things it's hard to tell what's going on. Okay so the computer has allowed us to see things. And it's allowed us to visualize them and rotate them in 3 dimensions, and see how they might come together or might not come together. And so the computer has done all kinds of stuff for chemistry over the course of my career. The other thing it does is there's thousands and thousands of papers that get published. And now with the aid of the computer I can better go through those papers and understand what I'm looking at, and do it in more precise manner. So that's why I'm giving you a prize because you're helping us invent new additives, okay.
82; ;00:43:08,160 --> 00:45:53,160; ;So antioxidants try to stop oxidation. And you can get to these things and you need other things to take that. Remember I said if the oxidized products react with each other the oil becomes more viscous. Viscosity is a speck, there's all kinds of lubricant specks; you can't get the oil more viscous over a certain length of time. Because it's no longer a good lubricant, and if it's no longer a good lubricant and it just sits in places it reacts even further. Okay and we have all kinds of new engine technology out there. And some of the new technology is called direct injection engines. You're going to hear about this later. Okay and direct injection engines, what the difference between a normal injector engine or a normal carborator engine and a direct injector engine, the way an engine works there's a valve. And in a normal engine, the gasoline in the air gets sprayed on the valve, the valve opens up and the mixture goes into the combustion chamber. Okay, when it's gasoline and it's in the gas phase it burns. And in a direct injected engine the gasoline is sprayed directly into the combustion chamber, no longer through the intake valve. There's an intake valve, but all that does is let air in.  And when you do that, some of the gasoline instead of being in the gas phase is in the liquid phase. And the idea is to oxidize the gasoline; and if you have a liquid, oxygen has to come in contact with this stuff. How does the oxygen come into contact with the stuff in the middle of the liquid? It's difficult, okay.  So you've greatly slowed that down, and as you're making reactive chemicals as you go through this process, they react with each other. And what do you get when that happens? You get little things called particulates.  So by direct injection engine technology, everybody remember what diesel trucks used to look like, okay? Diesel trucks used to be spewing out black smoke before they had traps on them. And the same thing can come out of a gasoline engine. There's better fuel economoy now. But because you have particulate formation, that's bad for the environments. There's about a bunch of specs that are gonna regulate how much particulates can come out. So when you do this, you've gotta control oxidation and do it the way you want it. And the new engine technology creates all these problems, and all these problems then need to be addressed.
83; ;00:45:53,160 --> 00:50:22,720; ;Okay before we get into all the additive classes that I'm going to show you, I've got to give you, this is for fun. Okay so I've kind of showed you what our chemicals kind of look like, now I'm going to show you, this is one of the major constituents at Tecron, which one of them is our additives.  Don't forget we have to have a portion on here that's going to make the stuff soluble in the gasoline and dissolve deposits out of your car and make them soluble in there. And then we need to have a portion that's going to bind to the deposit particle. First of all, if this is a real representation and if I looked at a deposit particle, how big do you think the deposit particle would be relative to the size of my hand? Anybody have an idea? I'll give you a clue: have you ever been to the Napa valley? And in the sky you see some things, what are they? Hot air balloons? Okay and if you look at a hot air balloon, the hot air balloon would be the deposit particle, this would be the additive. So if I want to surround that hot air balloon with these to solubilize it back into the gasoline, how many of these is it going to require? A lot. Yeah, you've got it, a lot. Okay and if you look at this, the portion that interacts, so the polar portion that says it's going to interact with the deposit particle. See that little blue thing here at the end? That's the nitrogen, that's an amine.  That interacts with the deposit particle. This is the part that's solubilizing it into the gasoline. So the part that's doing all the work is this. To get this big, gigantic thing to be soluble requires a lot of these. And so we always look for things that have more activity, more efficiency. Better to be able to bind to that hot air balloon. Because when these things bind, they just don't go on and stay there forever; they come on and they come off, they come on and they come off. And we want them to stay on so that we can get rid of the deposit particle. That's one of the reasons why Techron is so good, because that's been maximized. We have things in there that will really bind tightly to it. Okay. So I didn't talk about this at the very beginning, but Abby said we should show people what makes you excited, what do you get into. What makes your job fun? Okay, well I'm a chemist. I spend all my time trying to develop new things. I would say 99% of them don't work. Okay I learn lots of stuff from doing it though. When I tested one of the newest components in Techron in there, this is what a dirty intake valve looks like. See all that stuff in there? That black carbonation looking stuff? This is an intake valve, the gasoline sprays on there, it goes into the engine; but it gets hot here. And the stuff in there then oxidizes, what we were just talking about, reacts with each other and makes remember, when it goes from the gas phase to the liquid phase to the solid, it makes these deposits. That's what the hot air balloons are basically, relative to that thing I just had up here. Okay so tried to solubilize that. And the first time we ran that, a concentration of 50 parts per million. And if I had a gallon of gasoline, how many drops at 50 parts per million would be in there? So if I have a liquid and I have a gallon, if I wanted to make 50 parts per million of the additive in that gasoline, how many drops of additive would I have to add? Guess. Come on, a hundred? One? Three million? No number is wrong here? Come on, speak up? Wanda.
84; ;00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:23,740; ;Five million.
85; ;00:50:23,740 --> 00:50:33,400; ;Five million? Not close. Cathy?
86; ;00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:35,400; ;I'm going to guess one.
87; ;00:50:35,640 --> 00:51:10,460; ;Closer. It's 4 or 5. So the additive that I showed you, if you took 4 or 5 drops and you put it in a gallon of gasoline, you'd go from this to this. That's pretty impressive okay. Because the additives that we are currently developing, that we're kind of [unintelligible] have these kinds of functionality. Well we make packages and it contains lots of additives. A lot of things can work at very low dosages.
88; ;00:51:10,460 --> 00:51:13,020; ;I get to move around all the time. Yeah?
89; ;00:51:13,020 --> 00:51:19,840; ;So it removes it from engines that currently have it and prevents it from occuring in the future? Or just one or the other?
90; ;00:51:19,840 --> 00:51:24,500; ;It does both, okay. It does better at preventing...
91; ;00:51:24,500 --> 00:51:26,320; ;Can you repeat the question, Rich?
92; ;00:51:26,320 --> 00:52:08,200; ;So yeah, he asked me does the additive, if you had a dirty engine does it clean that up? In other words, if you used a competitor's gasoline and you had all those dirty looking valves like I showed you, does it take those deposits away? Or does it just take clean parts and keep them clean, and keep the deposits from forming on them, okay. And the answer to that is that it does both things. It's harder to take deposits away once they're formed, and thats where the chemistry we have in our package has been maximized to be able to accomplish that.
93; ;00:52:10,140 --> 00:52:20,540; ;If you always use Chevron gas that has already Tecron in it, do you then additionally need to add once in a while an extra technical cleaning?
94; ;00:52:20,540 --> 00:52:42,320; ;Okay so the question was if you use Chevron gas all the time, do I ever need the extra amount to clean it up further? And what do you guys think the answer to that is? Of course, who said that? I need see that person's face.
95; ;00:52:42,320 --> 00:52:44,000; ;I'm just trying to sell more additives.
96; ;00:52:44,000 --> 00:54:26,360; ;Oh I need to see you in the alley behind the building after the talk. The answer is to that is not very often, but sometimes you do. And the reason that is is there's parts of the engine that Tecron doesn't come in good contact with, okay? So if Tecron is coming in good contact, like an intake valve has stuff spraying on it, yep it works. There's no need for that stuff. But if it sprays in the combustion chamber, and a lot of the combustion chamber doesn't ever see the additive that's still going to get dirty. And that's been one of my jobs. They say to you like there's two windows, there's one over one at the bottom and one at the top, you can spray the bottom one with some Windex, I want you to clean the top one. It's next to impossible. Okay so for the most part you're fine, if you really wanted it super clean you'd need to use the after market product. Okay. So oxidation: in gasoline we want 100%, oils we don't want any. And because of oxidation, because a lot of side products to form in oil that we have to put other additives in there to account for.
97; ;00:54:26,360 --> 00:56:55,760; ;So how do we stop oxidation? Okay, so you know if you want to take antioxidants, we use basically the same types of things that people use for medical things. But we put functionality on them to solubilize things in oil. Okay the people that are inventing drugs actually have it easier than we do. Okay, why? Because the human body is a certain temperature. You take your temperature, if it's not right you don't get very hot. In an engine, you get areas of the engine that are very cold and you get parts of the engines that are very hot. At cold temperatures, oxidation is a slow process; at very hot temperatures it happens a lot faster. Okay, most chemical reactions at a hotter environment react faster. Why? Because things come in contact with each other more often. So we need to have protection throughout the temperature ranges in the engine. And we have the cold phenomena and the hot phenomena. And what do we do? We put things in there, and this is kind of a chemical term, to prevent radical formation. Radicals are very reactive chemicals [unintelligible]. And when you start forming radicals, they react with oxygen very quickly and they make peroxides. Peroxides break apart because oxygen bonds are weak. And if that forms, if that breaks apart, if you started out with one radical now you have two radicals. And if you have two radicals that reacts with more oxygen and now you have four radicals. And if you have four then it reacts with oxygen and then you have eight, and it keeps on going up and up and up. So it's a chain reaction, it's like a little nuclear bomb. It starts out small and all of the sudden it's happening very quickly and it's hard to stop things occuring. That's why when oils start to become viscous they go from very low viscosity to very high viscosity very quickly. So it's important then to be able to control both the formation of radicals and to be able to get rid of peroxides.
98; ;00:56:55,760 --> 00:57:37,600; ;So you don't form more, so you don't cascade the process. So for formulators, people working with oils, one of the most important things to remember if you're using antioxidants in the oil to prevent oxidation is there is absolutely a strong synergistic effect when you use a radical inhibitor.  Or a radical scavenger and a peroxide decomposer. Different chemicals have different types of properties and I'm going to show you that in a second.
99; ;00:57:37,600 --> 00:59:22,480; ;Okay, peroxide decomposers will react with the oxygens and the peroxides to get rid of them. And the chemicals that do that are basically sulfur, phosphorous, melidenum to some extent and some other metals.  So there's things in oil that contain sulfur and phosphorous, and their purpose is to decompose peroxides.  The first thing that happens I said is you make a radical. And the way you control radicals are, radicals are formed via heat, that's why hot is bad; via catalyst, sciable iron from your engine is bad. And when you get a radical you break your carbon-hydrogen bond, and you end up with a broken bond that has what's called an unpaired electron. And that unpaired electron is very unhappy and it's just looking for something else to react with, and that's typically oxygen to make a peroxide. But what the radical inhibitor does is it's got something that will make a radical. And these things are big. Don't forget, remember with the lines? There's 3 hydrogens attached to every one of the ends of these things. So this thing, while it's drawn in this kind of small diagram, it's like there's great big balls at the end of these things. And if you put something reactive there, it's shielded by these big balls and so it doesn't react any further. So it's a way to keep, remember I said the radicals typically react with oxygen, it's a way to keep those radicals from reacting with anything else. It stops the cascade process.
100; ;00:59:28,900 --> 01:02:51,160; ;Now if I really wanted to be mean I could just show you all these low numbers and I could say at the end "now I'm going to give you a quiz on which low is the number." That's not the point of this. Okay the point of this is to show you that [unintelligible] has a variety of antioxidants. And it's hard to tell, but the ones that are in bold are the ones we use more than others. Does that come through on your books? Yeah. So the bold ones are the ones that we typically use. We have, there's an associated with it. And if you look at that, we have both peroxide decomposers and radical scavengers.  And a combination of those two are what leads to good oxidation control. If you go back to the antioxidants, we have things that work better at low temperatures and high temperatures.  Remember I said in an engine you have all those temperatures.  So how do you control it? You need mixtures of low temperature and high temperature antioxidants. And so if you look at this there's diethynyl means, which are the high temperature ones, and there's hindered fenols, which are better at the lows. So there's combinations of these things to get the thing that's designed for particular engines and particular engine tests.  So if we take some of the oil, or we got all this fuel stuff coming in there and it's acids; we can't have acids in the acids because acids are going to eat the engine away.  It's going to corrode it, it's going to cause wear and all these issues.  So we need stuff in there that will neutralize acids. Now most of you have taken chemistry. What do you do to neutralize an acid? Yep, yay. Okay so acids and bases make salts. Salts are a lot less reactive. And so what is a detergent? A detergent is a base.  So when you get acids formed, you get both strong acids; you get nitric acid from nitrites and stuff in the oil. Plus you get weak acids. Don't forget, a weak acid is like vinegar is acetic acid; that's a weak acid, you can drink a bottle of that.  Sulfuric acid or hydrochloric acid is a strong acid. You're not drinking a bottle of that.  Okay, it dissolves most everything. Okay and so there's weak acids from the burning of the hydrocarbon stuff in there, and there's strong acids. And detergents also have weak bases and strong bases. And some of them work better for certain things and all additives, remember what I told you, there's no perfect dose cure here. They all have detriments as well as benefits.  And so you have a variety of these things to get all of the beneficial properties with the minimal detrimental properties.  So sometimes you need strong bases, sometimes you need weak bases. Okay and because in an engine we have weak and strong acids that are there.
101; ;01:02:51,160 --> 01:04:41,580; ;Okay what is a detergent? A detergent is a base. And a base that's commonly used as a calcium base, for instance calcium hydroxide. I'm drawing it sideways for a reason. Calcium and this is plus and this is minus.  And there's two of these minuses for every one of this because this is plus 2. Okay so if you look at that, is that soluble in oil? Remember what I said? The polar things are soluble in water, the non-polar things are soluble in oil.  If something's polar, that means it's not made of carbon and hydrogen; if something's non-polar it's made of carbon and hydrogen. What's that made out of? Calcium, oxygen and hydrogen, is that soluble in oil? No, okay. Though I could take all the base I want to, just dump it in there and it just would have this insoluble mess in the oil. So you have to solubilize the calcium.  And that's what the detergent does.  It has some organic functionality, and then it's got some carbons and hydrogens.  And you get, you surround this thing.
102; ;01:04:41,580 --> 01:08:13,800; ;Okay and you put many of them around there, just like I said happens with the deposit control additives. And if you put things with a bunch of carbons and hydrogens around it, now the outside of this looks like the oil, so it's soluble in the oil.  So a detergent is some amount of base, surrounded by some surfactant or backbone, okay. And the purpose of that stuff is to solubilize the base. Well there's different amounts of this in there; for some applications you want lots of this, for some applications you want not very much. And what the detergents have is these designations to them, which means low over base, low amounts of in this case calcium would be in there.  Medium amounts of it, large amounts of it, and super large amounts of it. And everything has what's called a base number, for the detergent, that depicts what it is. And if it's between 1 and 10, it's almost neutral. If it's between 15 and 30, that means it's going to react with that many acids. It's low. If it's 50 to 150 it's medium, and as you can see the numbers get bigger as the amount of base in there gets higher. So we have a variety of detergents that have those properties. What do these detergents do? Okay so remember I said we get acids from either oxidation from the oil or partial burning of the fuel, and those acids go right to the metal surfaces. Because acids are polar, metals are polar. So it's attracted. Okay now you have a bunch of stuff on here, and if they sit next to each other they're going to make deposits because they're going to be in close proximity; they have reactive functionality and that leads to deposit formation. So what the detergents do is they provide polar things to try to displace some of these acids that are stuck. And they can do that by charging. If you take an acid and you react it with a base, what do you get? What happens when you react an acid and a base? Sonya, I know you know the answer to this. What do you get? What do you get when you react an acid and a base? A salt, right. And the acid is the salt, the acid goes from CO2H to CO2 minus.  Okay, and it's negatively charged. And when you take two negatively charged things, so the base and the detergent cause that to become negatively charged.  And if you take two negative things and you try to push them together, what happens? Where's our muscle man? They repel, they don't like each other. So if you charge these acids up, they just fly off of there. And so that's what the detergent does, it charges the things up. And when it charges them up, they want to be apart. And it keeps them from agglomerating and keeps them from aggregating by charging them up.
103; ;01:08:13,800 --> 01:11:58,940; ;So I just drew these things as little circles with hydrocarbon tails. Well basically they're this, which is an [unintelligible], with some carbon-hydrogen chain and something that allows us to be associated with a metal. And the metal is the parts from the base. So the metal ions, typically we use calcium, magnesium, sodium, or lithium. And we have things that will surround it, which is this on this chart. So we have something that surrounds the base to help it be soluble in the oil, to take the base in there, to neutralize the acids or to prevent deposits from forming. So it's a way to control some of the things that are derived from oxidation.  Okay we have lots of them. And so there's a list there, and again the bold ones are the ones that are more commonly used. But we have calcium; some of them are highly over base, some of them are low over base, some of them highly, highly over base, and some of them contain other things. So this one is the newest one in there, and it's [unintelligible] 10600. And instead of having calcium, like most of the detergents did in the past, it has magnesium.  And there's a phenomena in new engines called LSPI. Okay, and LSPI stands for "Low Speed Pre-Ignition." And what happens is parts of the fuel come in contact with parts of the detergent. And the parts of the fuel are the acids from the fuel, and they come in contact with the detergent which has bases in there, which is supposed to happen, that's how they neutralize them. And it gathers things together. If it gathers parts of these acids together, it can ignite before the spark plug fires. And then that causes a big explosion in your engine, and it'll ruin the engine. And so to do that we were one of the first companies to come out there with what is a magnesium-based detergent. And what does the magnesium-based detergent do? Magnesium is a weaker base than calcium. Remember I said there's weak acids and strong acids? And so if you have a weaker base, you're going to get less salt problems.  So this has just come out, and it's basically to reduce this new engine phenomenon called LSPI. Sometimes we put things in here that give it additional functionality. Like this one says sulfur bridging. What does sulfur do? Remember I just showed you a second ago. Sulfur decompose peroxides, it's an antioxidant. So if you have sulfur in there, it can have two properties.  It can be a detergent backbone or it can be an antioxidant. And a lot of additives are like that, they have more than one functionality and they have multiple purposes.  So some of these contain sulfur.  So there's a wide variety of these. And when Ian and Markston Derwitz, who know about the formulating, this is their challenge. You should question them about the challenges, because they're the ones that are responsible for putting these things together the right way and get all the benefits and to know the detriments.
104; ;01:11:58,940 --> 01:13:26,580; ;Okay if the things start to react, they start to make deposits like I showed you on that valve; or smaller deposits. And we need things in there; those deposits react with each other to keep getting bigger, and bigger, and bigger. And to prevent that from happening, we need to put something around those initially formed deposits to keep from reacting with another one to make this bigger deposit particle, which is harder to clean up. And so what we do to prevent that, and so it's deposit protection, is we put dispersants in the oil. And a deposit is nothing but a carbon framework, it's carbons in the middle and it has some acids on the surface; and so again, it's a weak acid. And so to take that and keep it from bumping into another one, we can just charge it up; remember if we have light charges they fly apart just like the magnets. If they're small, we can do that. But if the carbon framework has gotten so big in the center, even the charging won't overcome that, we need to solubilize it. And that's where we get back to the soap phenomena. Put something that's attracted to the deposit particle to help solubilize it back into the oil, and it has to have all this greasy stuff on the outside just like soap.
105; ;01:13:26,580 --> 01:14:47,640; ;So this is a pictoral...if you're charging things, so the stuff goes to the surface, comes off, charges it - this is all charged; these two things, which would normally react with each other, fly apart. Okay, chemically what are these things? Well remember I said there's acid there, and amines react with acids. I showed you the fuel additive and that had that amine on there, and I showed you a little piece on that and that reacted with the acids on the deposit particles. Dispersants are in the oil and they also have a bunch of nitrogens, depicted by these little circles here. And then there's some big chain on there. And we have a variety of these things with different lengths of chains. And different amounts of nitrogen between these things. The purpose of that is if you got big deposit particles it has to be big molecular weight stuff to [unintelligible], if you have small deposit particles you've got to charge it up. So you don't need much size to it, you want basically just nitrogens to neutralize the acid. Everybody with me? I hope so because there's a quiz next period.
106; ;01:14:47,640 --> 01:15:45,300; ;Okay. So again we have things that are a thousand molecular weight. A thousand molecular weight is getting pretty big, but it's what makes it soluble in the oil and stuff. And we have 1300 molecular weight even bigger, and we have 2300 molecular weight even bigger.  And we do certain things because the nitrogens can also have detrimental properties. If you don't treat them sometimes if you have lots of basic nitrogen, it can cause breakdown of seals. And we don't want that to happen. So it's a band aid for the harm effect of the additive. Again same thing, the bolder ones are most commonly used.
107; ;01:15:45,300 --> 01:17:55,240; ;Okay now I'm going to talk about anti-wear. And anti-wear are things that, remember, we put on the metal surface that makes this hard coating so that when the metals rub against each other they don't cause breaking down of the metal surface, okay? So we put something on there and they're called [unintelligible]; and they make a film that's called a polyphosphate film. And polyphosphate film is a polymer; a hard surface on top of the metal surface. So when the parts rub across each other, you don't take away the metal. And there's a bad thing about these things; remember I said good things and bad things about all these things. If you have a surface, I'm going to draw a metal surface. And you have two metal surfaces and one's going this way and one's stationary, they're going to rub across each other, right? Okay and when they come in contact, that's when you have a wear problem. So we're putting a hard coating on there. And what happens when you put a hard coating on this? You get parts of this now that are contacting that weren't contacting before, because it's bigger. You just put something on top, if you put more rocks on top of the mountain, the mountain gets taller. And so if you make this taller and these things rub across each other, now you're creating friction. So you've prevented the wear, but you've also created friction; we don't want friction because that decreases fuel economy. So you solve one problem, create another problem.
108; ;01:17:55,240 --> 01:18:28,280; ;Okay we have the [unintelligible] phosphates that we use as dispersants, also besides forming polyphosphate films, they have phosphorous and sulfur in there. And what does phosphorous and sulfur do, besides anti-wear things? Peroxide decomposers. Casey did you say that? You get a prize. Thank you.
109; ;01:18:28,280 --> 01:21:58,060; ;So they're susceptible to oxidation and when you oxidize, you can incorporate those in there. And we have different types of zinc dithalphosphates; some have more bulky groups than others. And the ones with the more bulky groups are these, it says C8 and these are C4 to C6. Because the bulkier the groups are on there, the more soluble in the oil they are and the less susceptible to oxidation; they become good oxidation inhibitors. They don't go away right away. So we have these zinc dithalphosphates that make polyphasphate films that add wear protection to the oil. The other thing I said remember is when we perform these polyphosphate films, we create more friction. What are we going to do about that?  Okay well there's basically three types of friction. If the surfaces are far apart, the only thing that impacts this one from sliding across the yellow here is the oil, the gray stuff is the metal surface. To slide across, if this is viscous it's harder for these to slide across that one. So we keep the oil viscosity low when there's no contact involved. When there's integral contact involved, like when I was showing you the wear protection film on there, then the only thing you can do to prevent that is put a graphitic like coating on it. Everybody is familiar with graphite, you can rub layers off and it allows things to slide across each other. Well we use a chemical that's called [unintelligible], and moly sulfite is just like graphite. If you looked at it, its structure would be very similar to the structure of graphite. It allows things to slide across each other; so we have things that impact this type of friction. And I showed these graphitic like layers with this picture down here you can see there's one layer that's attracted to the top layer, but the layers can still slide. It's not attached so strongly that it can't slide across each other. The other thing we can try to do is to keep, as these things get closer to each other, is to put something on top of the metal surface to keep the metal parts from coming in contact with each other. In other words, if we can stick something to the metal and it doesn't create friction, and it keeps the metal apart, you're going to have less friction. You get the friction when the metal comes in contact with each other. So we put molecules on there that interact with each other so that it keeps these metal surfaces farther apart.  And yet it has certain kind of light tail lengths on here; oil can still flow through there and they can still move across each other because they have weak interactions. And we call those mix regime friction modifiers, or organic modifiers. So these aren't metals like aluminum disulfide, but they're carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen and oxygen again.
110; ;01:21:58,060 --> 01:22:34,140; ;So again, a variety of friction modifiers. And the most commonly used one is the mixed regime friction modifier, a low of 17500. And don't forget, 3 regimes of friction, [unintelligible]. For the boundary, these for the mixed, and the oil viscosity when things are far apart. Keeping the oil at that low viscosity state.
111; ;01:22:34,140 --> 01:23:13,100; ;Okay. I said there's a quiz at the end of this. I'm not going to hand you each out a piece of paper and make timings and stuff. But I am going to say let's go through this list. If you have acids form in your oil, how do you get rid of the acids? Remember we talked about antioxidants keeps oxidation from occurring. Anti-wear protects the metal surface. Detergents neutralizes the acids, dispersants keeps the molecules further apart so they don't get...
1; ;00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,840; ;There's your audience right there. Personally I'm more of that marketing, creative; so chemistry.
2; ;00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:15,000; ;So thank you for doing that because now I know who I can ask questions of.
3; ;00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,540; ;So that makes my brain hurt.
4; ;00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:51,120; ;So for those of you that are not into chemistry, I want you to welcome Rich and [unintelligible] to this experience. We're gonna learn a little bit about Organic Chemistry and our components.  And what I like about Rich's approach is it [unintelligible] understandable.  So he will be calling on people, right. And there are prizes to be had, so make sure that your name tag is out. Be prepared, so good luck and see you on the flip side.
5; ;00:00:51,120 --> 00:01:53,600; ;Okay good morning. I'm Rich Cherpeck; I'm a chemist; I work here in Richmond. My main job is inventing new fuel additives. The owner of the current patent's [unintelligible], so being a chemist has always been fun to me. And again let me see the number of people in here that have taken college chemisty. Okay so most of you guys, that's good. Okay and then let me see, anybody in here that has never taken chemistry at all? Okay your job is when I start talking about too much chemistry, you need to say "I don't get it, step back". There's no bad "I don't get it" things; all questions are good questions. I appreciate the questions. As Abby said, if people are quiet and don't ask questions, I will ask questions.
6; ;00:01:53,600 --> 00:05:30,920; ;So it's a one or two way thing. So this morning what I'm really trying to accomplish is: one, why am I a chemist? So basically I'm a chemist because I like doing puzzles. Chemistry is not something where the general public thinks...what does the general public think a chemist is? Anybody? What do chemists do? Come on. So what the general public thinks chemists do is they walk around in white lab coats, they have test tubes hanging out of their ears and every four years they have to run over to Sweden to pick up their Nobel Prize. And believe me, that's not how it is. But what chemistry is there's a lot of give and take and learning and not learning. And it's like why am I chemist? Because I like solving puzzles.  And a lot of chemistry is making something, understanding what it does and then it's very rarely what you want it to be, but incorporating that knowledge into making the next step in the sequence until we come up with a new product. Okay new products are extremley important to this business. All of the engine technology you're going to see, a lot of the engine technology is changing. And every time it changes it introduces new problems, and we need to react to those with our product sight.  If we want to be the best additive company, we have to have the best performing additives. And we need to understand the changes that are occurring and then have our chemistry react to those in order to solve those problems. Another thing is chemistry is a very fertile area. There is no such thing as a perfect chemical out there. I mean I presume you've all seen the drug apps on TV. This compound here gets rid of your headache but it causes...then there's 5 minutes of nonsense saying it does this, this, this and this. Well that's the same thing that's true with additives. Additives do certain things and they do them very well, but there is no perfect additive. Especially when something even gets close to perfect, the technology of the engines change and it introduces a whole bunch more problems. So one of the reasons I'm a chemist is job security. There's never such a thing as a perfect chemical. What I want to give you this morning, a lot of people don't like chemistry because the first part of chemistry, in all chemistry courses it's a language thing. You're being taught a foreign language. There's lots of names of various things and you have to memorize them. But that's not the fun part of chemistry. The fun part part of chemistry is the understanding part; understanding why certain things do certain things. And that's what I'm going to try to give to you this morning is why certain additives, what function they provide in the products we sell. And why they do that. And I think it's important for you to get some of those things.  And because it gives you a better understanding, instead of a blue bottle with some additives in there of what that stuff in that blue bottle really does. The other thing about the chemistry aspects is if you have these things in the blue bottle, they do good things, they do bad things. And we have formulators who you'll see are subsequent to me whose job is totally to put the things together to get the best with the least problems associated with the chemicals.
7; ;00:05:33,360 --> 00:07:40,400; ;So the first thing I'm going to do about this morning, I said chemistry is a new language. And chemists use pictures. It's basically an easy way to portray things that you'd take many words to do. And I'm just going to go over some of those pictures with you, and you don't have to understand everything. Because I'll use pictures later on to give you a feeling for what that means and what that really represents. Then I'm going to go through the various chemicals that we have and I'm going to talk about why they behave the way they behave. And there's two simple concepts that you should get when we're done here. First of all oil is a very, what we call non-polar liquid. If you take oil and water, they do not mix. And we live in an aqueous world; our bodies are made out of water, most everything is associated with water. Well, water and oil don't mix. So we have a media that's opposite to the major part of the world. So we have to have the things, the chemicals, soluble and working in that media. And so polarity and how we get things that work in water that work in oil, a very important concept. The other thing is in chemistry, chemistry can be very simple. It's like charged things, and by charged I mean it either has lots of electrons or few electrons, react with each other. And if they're light charges they repel, and if they're opposite charges they attract. And if you get that and you can look at a chemical and figure out where's the positive and negative, the charges, you can predict what any reaction's going to do. And so we're going to have additives and I'm going to try to incorporate that.  So two concepts: polarity -- how do you dissolve stuff? And charges because that's going to do the working part of what the additive does.
8; ;00:07:40,400 --> 00:08:03,140; ;Okay and the last thing here is this is totally focused on lubricant and additive chemistry. And I'll try to relate some of these things to what is in the normal world. Everybody here has heard of an antioxidant? Is that true? Not true? Who hasn't heard of an antioxidant?
9; ;00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:04,760; ;Well we're going to get into that, right Rick?
10; ;00:08:04,760 --> 00:09:52,780; ;Right. Okay and so some of this pertains to what happens to you. Okay so first of all I'm going to show you a little bit about the drawings and what these drawings mean. Who can tell me what this is? Theresa, come on yeah. What is it? It's ethanol okay. That's the chemist's depiction of what ethanol is. All these thins that are next to it are representations of the same thing. Chemists basically want to get to the point really quick and don't want to waste a lot of time doing it. And so what do we do? We have drawings and we portray them. You can't see ethanol. If I hold up ethanol you don't know what it looks like. This is if you had a model of it. And you can out in space, this is what ethanol really does look like. And the black things in here are carbons, and C stands for carbon so that's this portion of it. The white things are hydrogens, and that's the H part in there; and the big red thing is Oxygen. Okay so if you see that, that's what ethanol would really look like. If I show you this, what is this? So there's a red thing in the middle, and there's two H's associated with it. So H2O, what is H2O?
11; ;00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:53,540; ;Water.
12; ;00:09:53,540 --> 00:11:56,720; ;Water, yeah. And so that's the way the chemists depict these things. So basically for a chemical drawing if there's a Carbon with 3 Hydrogens, the first thing that you typically do is you take out the Carbons. And you take and draw those line structures. So every Carbon is now just replaced with an intersection, a line. Okay, there's a Carbon, there's Carbon, an OH. Carbon, carbon OH. And the next thing you do is just remove the Hydrogens attached to the Carbons. And so if I take all these away and it's just understood that they're there, because Carbon always has 4 things bonded to it, you get a drawing that looks like this. So that's the CH3. That's the CH2, and that's the Oxygen and the Hydrogen. So everything you see is drawn like this, but it really represents this. Okay? If you look at this down here, it's the same thing. Carbons are connected to Carbons and there can be more than one bond between them. So there's a Carbon to Carbon double bond, and if I look at this and I remove the Carbons and I just draw it like that, you can see every place there was a Carbon there's just an intersection. Everybody with me? Okay. And then I just took away the Hydrogens, so you see all these Hydrogens went away. And you get something that's much simpler and much easier to depict. It is always names associated with things. Like when I said this was ethanol, a lot of people on the street just call that booze, okay? And water is a slang term, it's not the chemical name for water. So I'm going to draw something up here and then I'm going to call on a volunteer to convert what I've drawn up here into what I'm calling a line drawing.
13; ;00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:05,220; ;[unintelligible]
14; ;00:12:05,220 --> 00:13:14,680; ;I'm sorry? Okay so there's a...to make this fun, there's a prize for whoever can do this for me. Okay, so I need a volunteer. Theresa, get up here!  That's too bad. So convert that to the line drawing for me. So what are you going to do? I've already converted the lines, the Carbons, I've taken most of them away. Okay? And then she's going to remove the Hydrogens. And then's going to have a drawing up there.
15; ;00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:34,960; ;Okay so see, see what you did? All the Hydrogens are gone. So it's a simplistic representation of this.
16; ;00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:36,960; ;And do you know what that's called?
17; ;00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:47,700; ;This is [unintelligible]. It is [unintelligible].
18; ;00:13:47,700 --> 00:14:00,840; ;Okay it's... Aspirine. It's aspirine. So it's acetycelsic acid, but you'd call it aspirin. You can have a prize.
19; ;00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:05,000; ;So Theresa tell everybody what's your name?
20; ;00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,980; ;I'm Theresa, Theresa [unintelligible].
21; ;00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:08,420; ;And what do you do?
22; ;00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:11,960; ;I'm a research chemist and I work on the [unintelligible].
23; ;00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:22,580; ;Okay.
24; ;00:14:22,580 --> 00:16:37,000; ;So as you change things, as you add more. So this has got how many Carbons? Four. One, two, three, four. This has twice as many, it's 8. This has twice as many as that, it's 16. This has twice as many. And look what happens, when you have fewer Carbons, this is a gas. Okay when you double the size of it, it's a liquid, it's gasoline. If you double the size of that, it becomes even more thicker, and even closer to an oily substance, then it's diesel. It's diesel fuel. If you add more Carbons, it starts to become waxy.  So you go from gases, to liquids, to thicker liquids, to waxes. And then when you add lots of carbons, it becomes a solid. It's a plastic, it's what's called a polymer. But it's plastic, it's large. And why is that? That's what I really want you guys to get out of that.  If I had a box here, the same size box, and I put 10 of these in this small box that I have, they don't interact with each other. And they stay in the gas phase. They don't touch each other, they don't do things because they're small and there's a big volume in the box.  But if I put this in there, they come into contact with each other more often. And when you do that, you go from a gas to a liquid. Okay, and if you put a lot of them in there the liquid gets thicker. And if you put them in there in an array and they can't move around at all, it becomes waxes or solids. So the size will tell you how some of the properties of the composition of what you have is If you have few Carbons, it's going to be a gas. And the more you add, the more the properties change.
25; ;00:16:37,000 --> 00:17:14,120; ;So the shapes of things also have an impact on what they look like in 3 dimensional space. So we've all heard about fatty acids. And they say "don't eat certain ones", "certain ones are good for you" and that and so forth. So what fatty acids do they tell you not to eat because they're not good for you? I need a volunteer to answer this; there's a prize involved. Saturated, who said that? Good, come on up here.
26; ;00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:17,500; ;[unintelligible]
27; ;00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:29,440; ;No, chemists can participate. But you're not getting the prize until you answer another question. Okay, what about trans fatty acids?
28; ;00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:35,220; ;Trans fatty acids, well those are bad as well. Because you don't have the enzymes in your body to break them down.
29; ;00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:38,700; ;Well that's partly true. Okay and what about cis fatty acids?
30; ;00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:48,460; ;Cis fatty acids, they're liquids at room temperature. They're also more likely soluble with liquids in your body and therefore they don't clog your arteries and your body has the enzymes to break them down.
31; ;00:17:48,460 --> 00:18:09,340; ;Correct. And so if you get something that's clogging up your arteries, so it starts turning into a solid, it's going to clog it up. If it stays in the liquid phase, it doesn't clog it up. It's not that complicated, it's the way it is.  Okay, I'm not done with you yet. You're not getting your prize that easy.
32; ;00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:11,800; ;All right, that's fine.
33; ;00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,760; ;What kind of fatty acid is this?
34; ;00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,200; ;That's a cis fatty acid.
35; ;00:18:15,200 --> 00:19:09,340; ;So there's a carbon-carbon bond in this, and it's a cis fatty acid. And you see the cis fatty acid, the one that says unsaturated on the bottom, see the liquid to it? And why is this one liquid? Well remember I said if you force things in this box and you have chemical interactions, the more you restrict the rotation, the less they'll be able to move. So if this guy can hardly interact with another one, because it's all bent up, okay? These guys can interact with each other. And when they interact with each other it basically compacts them into space, you have solids. So it's pretty straight forward and simple. Thanks, Greg. And what's your job?
36; ;00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:15,620; ;I'm an analytical chemist for fuel technology and additives.
37; ;00:19:15,620 --> 00:20:06,920; ;Now so anybody can come up. I mean with free prizes you guys should be running up here. Okay so the shape, this thing and this they all have, if you look at the carbons, they all have the same number of carbons.  They all have relatively the same number of hydrogens, the ones with double bonds, the cis one, has two less. But that's not what's impacting their properties: it's the shape that they're in. And certain carbon double bonds don't allow free rotation about them. And so it restricts this to shape, and the shape it restricts it in allows it to be a liquid all the time.
38; ;00:20:06,920 --> 00:21:09,640; ;So far we've got size matters for the properties, shape matters for the properties. Okay and now I'm going to talk about polarity. I just said oils and water aren't missable, right? So if you get grease on your plate at your house and you pour water over it, what happens? Come on what happens? How do you get the grease off the plate? You have to put soap into the water. You can run water over the grease all day and nothing's happening. But when you stick something in there you can solubilize it. And that's a lot like what our additives do. We have deposits in engines that aren't soluble in oil, and by introducing the additive, the additive can make them soluble. So it's the ability of the additive to interact with those things to give it those properties.
39; ;00:21:09,640 --> 00:22:59,340; ;Okay so there are certain things that make organic chemicals polar, and there are certain things that make them non polar. So non polar, polar.  The non-polar things are basically just made up of...what is oil made up of? Carbon and hydrogen. There's very little bit of any other things, and that's non-polar. So things with carbon and hydrogens are non-polar. Things with other types of atoms in it are polar. Okay and so if that's the case, we have a media that's like this, but we really live in a world with like water and sodium chloride, and all of these various metals and things that looks like that. So one of the major challenges of lubricating oil additives is how do you correlate those to each other and how to use the polar functionality in an oil environment.  So here it is again, here's a picture. Like things, if it's polar, like things, polar things dissolve in water.  Polar things dissolve in water, non polar things dissolve in oil. And the additive helps change the things that which it's soluble in. So if you have a deposit in an engine and you want it to be soluble in the oil, it's just like a soap.  It's gotta interact with the deposit particle and carry that deposit particle back into the oil.
40; ;00:22:59,340 --> 00:24:06,180; ;How do we do that? Okay what we do for a soap is we take something that's soluble in the water and we take the grease with something that's soluble in the grease. And if you take something that's soluble in the grease and the opposite end is soluble in the water, the grease gets surrounded by the things that it's like, the greasy stuff, and the other end it exposed is the part that's soluble in the water. So you take the grease and it goes into the water because the compound that's called the soap has two parts to that. And those two parts are having something that's soluble in water, this is what I'm calling here is a polar head, and something that's soluble in the grease, which is the non-polar end. So you have a molecule with both types of functionality and allows those two to be soluble in each other.
41; ;00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:35,780; ;Okay, anybody have an idea what this is? Come on, wake up. What is that? It's a detergent, exactly. Correct. You get a prize. So it's detergent, and why is this a detergent? Because first of all what's your name?
42; ;00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:36,740; ;Charles.
43; ;00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:37,860; ;Okay, and what do you do?
44; ;00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:41,380; ;[unintelligible]
45; ;00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:43,280; ;So are you a chemical engineer?
46; ;00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:44,260; ;Yes.
47; ;00:24:44,260 --> 00:26:32,160; ;Okay. Chemical engineers are okay. Go ahead. So we have something here, and what's the polar end of this? The part that's not containing just carbon and hydrogens. But it's this, and this is the part that's soluble in the water and this is the part that's soluble in the grease on your plate. Okay and so if you have this that's soluble in the grease, then the outside of this thing looks all like this and the water thinks it's just something polar; it tricked it. And that's how you solubilize the grease into the water. So the other portion of this then needs to interact with things.  Okay and I said it could interact with deposit particles, but it also needs to interact with other things.  And there's certain things that it's going to be attracted to. And I need two people up here. I want somebody that's big, and looks big and strong, and somebody that's small. So I need two volunteers up here. Or I'll just pick somebody, I can use my own judgement. But I'm giving you this opportunity. Okay a big person, come on. Stand up. Mike, he's tall. Aren't you semi-tall? Okay come on up here. I need somebody that's short. I'm gonna make you all stand up and I'm gonna pick someone.
48; ;00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:34,580; ;[unintelligible]
49; ;00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:44,960; ;Um no that's my surprise, this is... So Jessica come on up here.
50; ;00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,700; ;You've been looking at me for over two minutes.
51; ;00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:51,140; ;Well I was just kind of trying to, it's hard to size people up.
52; ;00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:52,460; ;I'm almost insulted that you're calling me short.
53; ;00:26:52,460 --> 00:27:48,540; ;No insult to you. Okay. So okay I'm gonna make this. So you're the big guy here, okay. And I'm gonna take, what are these things? Magnets, okay.  If you can understand magnets, you can understand chemistry. So if I take the same ends of the magnets, I labeled this one as minus because I'm going to depict this as a minus charge, and I bring it to the other magnet, with the same charge what happens? Yeah, let's give it to this big strong guy here and ask him to put these things together. So put the negatives to the negatives. No, no. You barely, ahh no. Okay let's give this little weak person over here.
54; ;00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:50,380; ;Do you want me to act?
55; ;00:27:50,380 --> 00:28:46,480; ;No, I'm gonna take...[unintelligible]. So we're going to see who's stronger, all right? So you can take these and put them together like this. And I want you to do this and see how easy this was.  See that was easy. She didn't have that much of a hard time, he did. Why? Because like things repel each other, opposite things attract.  And that's not that complicated, but that's how chemicals are too. The most positive thing always reacts with the most negative thing.  And the same thing with additive interactions, it's additives' actions are based on. Causing that kind of reaction to occur and then solubilizing the products back into the oil. Okay you both can have prizes even though you weren't [unintelligible] as strong.
56; ;00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:57,860; ;[unintelligible]
57; ;00:28:57,860 --> 00:29:30,720; ;Okay so again what do we do with these additives? We have a polar thing that does all the work, that does all the chemistry and we have something attached to it that helps solubilize it into oil. Or is able to just at least take this thing and make it soluble in the oil. So now that I've given you the fundamentals and the background. And what are the two fundamentals again?
58; ;00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:47,380; ;I'm just gonna call on somebody. Sean, stand up. And your name is Sean McGinness?
59; ;00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:47,920; ;Yes.
60; ;00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:49,240; ;And what do you do?
61; ;00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:51,100; ;[unintelligible]
62; ;00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:58,820; ;And so what are the two things that are important for designing new additives?
63; ;00:29:58,820 --> 00:30:01,040; ;Whether or not they're polar.
64; ;00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:01,400; ;Right.
65; ;00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:06,700; ;And the second one was whether or not they're [unintelligible].
66; ;00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:48,560; ;They can react with each other and the charge attraction.  The one he said, the first thing is the polarity. In other words, how do you solubilize things into oil? How do you make the functional part of the additive soluble? The other part is the functional part. And there just like the little magnets, the opposite ends attract, the like ends they fly apart. So if you don't want things to stick to each other and you make them the same charge, well if they're the same charge they're not coming together. And that's an important design feature and an important aspect to a lot of how our additives function.
67; ;00:30:48,560 --> 00:31:22,360; ;Okay. Did I lose the microphone for some reason? Hello? What happened? I don't know what happened. Did the battery go? It says battery. [unintelligible]
68; ;00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:25,960; ;This thing better not dislike chemistry.
69; ;00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:32,020; ;[unintelligible]
70; ;00:31:32,020 --> 00:33:43,720; ;So we have a variety...can everybody hear me okay? We have a variety of things that are in our additive packages, that are in lubricating oil. And this is kind of a list of what they are. I'm going to need to stand here so that I can, too many things. Okay and we have things that impact the wear and durability of an engine. And what everybody, what's the common oil drain interval? When I was a kid you always had to change the oil every 3,000 miles, right? That's what the recommended dosage was. But if you have a newer car, how often do they tell you to change the oil? 6,000, 10,000; it keeps getting longer, okay? And for that to occur, what do you have to do?  The oil has to...um hello? The oil has to last longer. And also it's gotta be more stable, and what it's gotta be stable to is what degrades oil is oxidation.  And what is oxidation? Oxidation is the introduction of oxygen atoms into a hydrocarbon. So in some cases, we want things to oxidize.  We burn gasoline, and when we burn gasoline [unintelligible] when we burn gasoline we want it to react with oxygen because oxidation is a heat-releasing kind of reaction. And when you release heat you can get energy from the fuel. In other words when you have a cold space and in becomes hot you generate some kind of force. So when we have gasoline and we burn it up, we want it to release a lot of small molecules-- in this case CO2.  It creates pressure and it releases heat. And that forces in the case of a car a piston to move. Okay I'm gonna move.
71; ;00:33:43,720 --> 00:35:03,020; ;Okay so in other cases we want the oil, the lubricating oil in the car, to stay perfectly intact.  We don't want it to go away. And that's why because of the newer oils, that are called synthetic oils, that are less reactive to oxidation reactions, by being less reactive to oxidation reactions they last longer. They've gone from 3,000 miles, 6,000 miles, 10,000 miles and it keeps getting higher. But the additives can do the same thing to the oil. And the additives also play a role in accomplishing that. And we have things up here that are there for the oil protection called antioxidants.  And you have antioxidants in food, and remember when I said at the beginning what are the purpose of those antioxidants. Well the purpose of the antioxidants you eat for health purposes is to keep the things in your body from oxidizing. Because oxidizing degrades things. When you have oil oxidizing causes the formation of reactive chemicals.  And if you have something that's C20 and it reacts with another C20, it gets twice as big. And if it gets bigger, what does that do to the oil? Speak up.
72; ;00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:03,820; ;It becomes a solid.
73; ;00:35:03,820 --> 00:38:22,820; ;Yeah, it goes towards a solid. First it becomes viscous, okay so it becomes bigger.  And as it gets bigger and bigger and bigger, it starts to become and starts to oxidize further, it starts to get converted into deposits. Deposits are polar so they go to the metal surfaces, they stick to the metal surfaces and they are not floating around. And they cause all kinds of problems. So we've gone from a liquid to a thicker liquid. And when you increase the viscosity of the oil, it's no longer as good as a friction modifier; it no longer decreases friction because the moving parts are moving across something thick it's harder for them to move. If moving parts are moving across a media that's thin, it's easy for them to move. So oxidation in the fuel is fantastic, we want it to occur 100%. Oxidation in the oil is bad news. Okay so we have things in there called antioxidants. And all these things, pretty much the detergents and the [unintelligible] are to take out the products you get via oxidation.  And I'm gonna go through each of these in a lot more detail, but this is just to give you a general overview of what the additive chemistry is in there. There are certain things that are anti-wear additives. If you take one metal, and a metal surface is not flat, it doesn't look like this table; but on a molecular level it's very jagged. There's all kinds of peaks and valleys in there. And when those peaks rub against each other the metals move across, what happens to the metal? That peak gets sheared off. And now you're getting wear in your engine.  So we have additives in the oil that sit on top of the metal surface to make it actually harder, so that when the things rub against each other they don't take a chunk of the metal away. And those things are called anti-wear additives.  Okay and then the whole purpose of the lubricant in the first place is to reduce friction. You want to facilitate metal parts moving across metal parts.  And we put things in the oil that decreases friction. So if you have these things that are going to rub against each other, we have to put things in the oil to prevent that from happening. Okay, and the things that we put in oil to do that are called friction modifiers And the things that we add to oil to keep it in the low viscosity range, and but the oil has to be the same viscosity at all temperatures. If you start your car up in the morning, you don't want the oil to be very, very thick. If you do, your car won't start. So you want the oil to be thin. But if it's an extremely hot day, you don't want the oil to be so thin that it's volatilizing out of there and not doing much. And so you want it to be thicker. So we put things in there that are called viscosity modifiers that will change the viscosity of an oil. All these things are predominantly the things that we have for the oil.
74; ;00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:29,580; ;[unintelligible]
75; ;00:38:29,580 --> 00:39:38,860; ;Okay the first thing I'm going to go over in a little more detail is oxidation. And oxidation again, and wear and durability additives as a whole, is how do you stop things that you put in the oil. And the oil is a very harsh environment. By harsh, I'm saying there's a lot of chemically reactive that comes in there. And where do the chemically reactive things come from? Well, one, to burn gasoline requires oxygen.  And when you have oxygen and carbon, you want it to go to CO2 to get the most efficiency.  But it always doesn't go to CO2. Some of it goes to reactive chemicals, and those reactive chemicals react with each other and they cause changes to the oil. And so what we want to do then is make the oil that so it can deal with that phenomena.
76; ;00:39:38,860 --> 00:40:20,740; ;Okay, so what do antioxidants do? They stop oxidation.  Just like I said you take, for human health benefits, you take antioxidants. And when you take those antioxidants you try to keep the parts of your body from getting oxidized.  Here we're trying to keep the oil from getting oxidized. If we did that a 100%, would we have the problem solved? Yes or no? Would we have oil that lasts forever if we could stop oxidation totally? Thomas, what do you think?
77; ;00:40:20,740 --> 00:41:38,220; ;Yeah. Try again. No, and the answer why is that, well we've certainly made progress and that's what we've done by prolonging the oil drain intervals.  We've gone to oxidatively more stable oils, the synthetics. Okay, but we can't solve a problem because we have gasoline that is burning. And the gasoline gets partially burnt, and then the piston comes up and pulls that partially burned gasoline into the oil. And those products are about the same as if you oxidize the oil. So we gotta to continue a supply of pouring oxidized products into the oil, because of the burning of the fuel. So even if I gave you the world's best antioxidant, you still don't have the problem solved. It's more complicated than that. It's job security, okay? And what these things do is require other things. They require detergents and dispersants. And a lot of the things that are oxidation products are acids. And what happens when you contact a metal surface with acids?
78; ;00:41:38,220 --> 00:41:39,460; ;Corrosion?
79; ;00:41:39,460 --> 00:41:48,220; ;Yep, corrosion. You've got it. Eva, get a prize. First of all, what do you do?
80; ;00:41:48,220 --> 00:41:49,900; ;I'm an IT.
81; ;00:41:49,900 --> 00:43:08,160; ;You're an IT? And why is that important to inventing new additives? Why would that be important to adding new additives? I'm a chemist here. Every single person in this room does some job that's important to inventing new compounds. And I'm interested in inventing new commercial products. That's my job, okay. And so in your role, why is that important to me inventing new compounds? You're looking puzzled. I'm telling you, in chemistry remember I just showed you those models.  And in chemistry, if you can't see things it's hard to tell what's going on. Okay so the computer has allowed us to see things. And it's allowed us to visualize them and rotate them in 3 dimensions, and see how they might come together or might not come together. And so the computer has done all kinds of stuff for chemistry over the course of my career. The other thing it does is there's thousands and thousands of papers that get published. And now with the aid of the computer I can better go through those papers and understand what I'm looking at, and do it in more precise manner. So that's why I'm giving you a prize because you're helping us invent new additives, okay.
82; ;00:43:08,160 --> 00:45:53,160; ;So antioxidants try to stop oxidation. And you can get to these things and you need other things to take that. Remember I said if the oxidized products react with each other the oil becomes more viscous. Viscosity is a speck, there's all kinds of lubricant specks; you can't get the oil more viscous over a certain length of time. Because it's no longer a good lubricant, and if it's no longer a good lubricant and it just sits in places it reacts even further. Okay and we have all kinds of new engine technology out there. And some of the new technology is called direct injection engines. You're going to hear about this later. Okay and direct injection engines, what the difference between a normal injector engine or a normal carborator engine and a direct injector engine, the way an engine works there's a valve. And in a normal engine, the gasoline in the air gets sprayed on the valve, the valve opens up and the mixture goes into the combustion chamber. Okay, when it's gasoline and it's in the gas phase it burns. And in a direct injected engine the gasoline is sprayed directly into the combustion chamber, no longer through the intake valve. There's an intake valve, but all that does is let air in.  And when you do that, some of the gasoline instead of being in the gas phase is in the liquid phase. And the idea is to oxidize the gasoline; and if you have a liquid, oxygen has to come in contact with this stuff. How does the oxygen come into contact with the stuff in the middle of the liquid? It's difficult, okay.  So you've greatly slowed that down, and as you're making reactive chemicals as you go through this process, they react with each other. And what do you get when that happens? You get little things called particulates.  So by direct injection engine technology, everybody remember what diesel trucks used to look like, okay? Diesel trucks used to be spewing out black smoke before they had traps on them. And the same thing can come out of a gasoline engine. There's better fuel economoy now. But because you have particulate formation, that's bad for the environments. There's about a bunch of specs that are gonna regulate how much particulates can come out. So when you do this, you've gotta control oxidation and do it the way you want it. And the new engine technology creates all these problems, and all these problems then need to be addressed.
83; ;00:45:53,160 --> 00:50:22,720; ;Okay before we get into all the additive classes that I'm going to show you, I've got to give you, this is for fun. Okay so I've kind of showed you what our chemicals kind of look like, now I'm going to show you, this is one of the major constituents at Tecron, which one of them is our additives.  Don't forget we have to have a portion on here that's going to make the stuff soluble in the gasoline and dissolve deposits out of your car and make them soluble in there. And then we need to have a portion that's going to bind to the deposit particle. First of all, if this is a real representation and if I looked at a deposit particle, how big do you think the deposit particle would be relative to the size of my hand? Anybody have an idea? I'll give you a clue: have you ever been to the Napa valley? And in the sky you see some things, what are they? Hot air balloons? Okay and if you look at a hot air balloon, the hot air balloon would be the deposit particle, this would be the additive. So if I want to surround that hot air balloon with these to solubilize it back into the gasoline, how many of these is it going to require? A lot. Yeah, you've got it, a lot. Okay and if you look at this, the portion that interacts, so the polar portion that says it's going to interact with the deposit particle. See that little blue thing here at the end? That's the nitrogen, that's an amine.  That interacts with the deposit particle. This is the part that's solubilizing it into the gasoline. So the part that's doing all the work is this. To get this big, gigantic thing to be soluble requires a lot of these. And so we always look for things that have more activity, more efficiency. Better to be able to bind to that hot air balloon. Because when these things bind, they just don't go on and stay there forever; they come on and they come off, they come on and they come off. And we want them to stay on so that we can get rid of the deposit particle. That's one of the reasons why Techron is so good, because that's been maximized. We have things in there that will really bind tightly to it. Okay. So I didn't talk about this at the very beginning, but Abby said we should show people what makes you excited, what do you get into. What makes your job fun? Okay, well I'm a chemist. I spend all my time trying to develop new things. I would say 99% of them don't work. Okay I learn lots of stuff from doing it though. When I tested one of the newest components in Techron in there, this is what a dirty intake valve looks like. See all that stuff in there? That black carbonation looking stuff? This is an intake valve, the gasoline sprays on there, it goes into the engine; but it gets hot here. And the stuff in there then oxidizes, what we were just talking about, reacts with each other and makes remember, when it goes from the gas phase to the liquid phase to the solid, it makes these deposits. That's what the hot air balloons are basically, relative to that thing I just had up here. Okay so tried to solubilize that. And the first time we ran that, a concentration of 50 parts per million. And if I had a gallon of gasoline, how many drops at 50 parts per million would be in there? So if I have a liquid and I have a gallon, if I wanted to make 50 parts per million of the additive in that gasoline, how many drops of additive would I have to add? Guess. Come on, a hundred? One? Three million? No number is wrong here? Come on, speak up? Wanda.
84; ;00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:23,740; ;Five million.
85; ;00:50:23,740 --> 00:50:33,400; ;Five million? Not close. Cathy?
86; ;00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:35,400; ;I'm going to guess one.
87; ;00:50:35,640 --> 00:51:10,460; ;Closer. It's 4 or 5. So the additive that I showed you, if you took 4 or 5 drops and you put it in a gallon of gasoline, you'd go from this to this. That's pretty impressive okay. Because the additives that we are currently developing, that we're kind of [unintelligible] have these kinds of functionality. Well we make packages and it contains lots of additives. A lot of things can work at very low dosages.
88; ;00:51:10,460 --> 00:51:13,020; ;I get to move around all the time. Yeah?
89; ;00:51:13,020 --> 00:51:19,840; ;So it removes it from engines that currently have it and prevents it from occuring in the future? Or just one or the other?
90; ;00:51:19,840 --> 00:51:24,500; ;It does both, okay. It does better at preventing...
91; ;00:51:24,500 --> 00:51:26,320; ;Can you repeat the question, Rich?
92; ;00:51:26,320 --> 00:52:08,200; ;So yeah, he asked me does the additive, if you had a dirty engine does it clean that up? In other words, if you used a competitor's gasoline and you had all those dirty looking valves like I showed you, does it take those deposits away? Or does it just take clean parts and keep them clean, and keep the deposits from forming on them, okay. And the answer to that is that it does both things. It's harder to take deposits away once they're formed, and thats where the chemistry we have in our package has been maximized to be able to accomplish that.
93; ;00:52:10,140 --> 00:52:20,540; ;If you always use Chevron gas that has already Tecron in it, do you then additionally need to add once in a while an extra technical cleaning?
94; ;00:52:20,540 --> 00:52:42,320; ;Okay so the question was if you use Chevron gas all the time, do I ever need the extra amount to clean it up further? And what do you guys think the answer to that is? Of course, who said that? I need see that person's face.
95; ;00:52:42,320 --> 00:52:44,000; ;I'm just trying to sell more additives.
96; ;00:52:44,000 --> 00:54:26,360; ;Oh I need to see you in the alley behind the building after the talk. The answer is to that is not very often, but sometimes you do. And the reason that is is there's parts of the engine that Tecron doesn't come in good contact with, okay? So if Tecron is coming in good contact, like an intake valve has stuff spraying on it, yep it works. There's no need for that stuff. But if it sprays in the combustion chamber, and a lot of the combustion chamber doesn't ever see the additive that's still going to get dirty. And that's been one of my jobs. They say to you like there's two windows, there's one over one at the bottom and one at the top, you can spray the bottom one with some Windex, I want you to clean the top one. It's next to impossible. Okay so for the most part you're fine, if you really wanted it super clean you'd need to use the after market product. Okay. So oxidation: in gasoline we want 100%, oils we don't want any. And because of oxidation, because a lot of side products to form in oil that we have to put other additives in there to account for.
97; ;00:54:26,360 --> 00:56:55,760; ;So how do we stop oxidation? Okay, so you know if you want to take antioxidants, we use basically the same types of things that people use for medical things. But we put functionality on them to solubilize things in oil. Okay the people that are inventing drugs actually have it easier than we do. Okay, why? Because the human body is a certain temperature. You take your temperature, if it's not right you don't get very hot. In an engine, you get areas of the engine that are very cold and you get parts of the engines that are very hot. At cold temperatures, oxidation is a slow process; at very hot temperatures it happens a lot faster. Okay, most chemical reactions at a hotter environment react faster. Why? Because things come in contact with each other more often. So we need to have protection throughout the temperature ranges in the engine. And we have the cold phenomena and the hot phenomena. And what do we do? We put things in there, and this is kind of a chemical term, to prevent radical formation. Radicals are very reactive chemicals [unintelligible]. And when you start forming radicals, they react with oxygen very quickly and they make peroxides. Peroxides break apart because oxygen bonds are weak. And if that forms, if that breaks apart, if you started out with one radical now you have two radicals. And if you have two radicals that reacts with more oxygen and now you have four radicals. And if you have four then it reacts with oxygen and then you have eight, and it keeps on going up and up and up. So it's a chain reaction, it's like a little nuclear bomb. It starts out small and all of the sudden it's happening very quickly and it's hard to stop things occuring. That's why when oils start to become viscous they go from very low viscosity to very high viscosity very quickly. So it's important then to be able to control both the formation of radicals and to be able to get rid of peroxides.
98; ;00:56:55,760 --> 00:57:37,600; ;So you don't form more, so you don't cascade the process. So for formulators, people working with oils, one of the most important things to remember if you're using antioxidants in the oil to prevent oxidation is there is absolutely a strong synergistic effect when you use a radical inhibitor.  Or a radical scavenger and a peroxide decomposer. Different chemicals have different types of properties and I'm going to show you that in a second.
99; ;00:57:37,600 --> 00:59:22,480; ;Okay, peroxide decomposers will react with the oxygens and the peroxides to get rid of them. And the chemicals that do that are basically sulfur, phosphorous, melidenum to some extent and some other metals.  So there's things in oil that contain sulfur and phosphorous, and their purpose is to decompose peroxides.  The first thing that happens I said is you make a radical. And the way you control radicals are, radicals are formed via heat, that's why hot is bad; via catalyst, sciable iron from your engine is bad. And when you get a radical you break your carbon-hydrogen bond, and you end up with a broken bond that has what's called an unpaired electron. And that unpaired electron is very unhappy and it's just looking for something else to react with, and that's typically oxygen to make a peroxide. But what the radical inhibitor does is it's got something that will make a radical. And these things are big. Don't forget, remember with the lines? There's 3 hydrogens attached to every one of the ends of these things. So this thing, while it's drawn in this kind of small diagram, it's like there's great big balls at the end of these things. And if you put something reactive there, it's shielded by these big balls and so it doesn't react any further. So it's a way to keep, remember I said the radicals typically react with oxygen, it's a way to keep those radicals from reacting with anything else. It stops the cascade process.
100; ;00:59:28,900 --> 01:02:51,160; ;Now if I really wanted to be mean I could just show you all these low numbers and I could say at the end "now I'm going to give you a quiz on which low is the number." That's not the point of this. Okay the point of this is to show you that [unintelligible] has a variety of antioxidants. And it's hard to tell, but the ones that are in bold are the ones we use more than others. Does that come through on your books? Yeah. So the bold ones are the ones that we typically use. We have, there's an associated with it. And if you look at that, we have both peroxide decomposers and radical scavengers.  And a combination of those two are what leads to good oxidation control. If you go back to the antioxidants, we have things that work better at low temperatures and high temperatures.  Remember I said in an engine you have all those temperatures.  So how do you control it? You need mixtures of low temperature and high temperature antioxidants. And so if you look at this there's diethynyl means, which are the high temperature ones, and there's hindered fenols, which are better at the lows. So there's combinations of these things to get the thing that's designed for particular engines and particular engine tests.  So if we take some of the oil, or we got all this fuel stuff coming in there and it's acids; we can't have acids in the acids because acids are going to eat the engine away.  It's going to corrode it, it's going to cause wear and all these issues.  So we need stuff in there that will neutralize acids. Now most of you have taken chemistry. What do you do to neutralize an acid? Yep, yay. Okay so acids and bases make salts. Salts are a lot less reactive. And so what is a detergent? A detergent is a base.  So when you get acids formed, you get both strong acids; you get nitric acid from nitrites and stuff in the oil. Plus you get weak acids. Don't forget, a weak acid is like vinegar is acetic acid; that's a weak acid, you can drink a bottle of that.  Sulfuric acid or hydrochloric acid is a strong acid. You're not drinking a bottle of that.  Okay, it dissolves most everything. Okay and so there's weak acids from the burning of the hydrocarbon stuff in there, and there's strong acids. And detergents also have weak bases and strong bases. And some of them work better for certain things and all additives, remember what I told you, there's no perfect dose cure here. They all have detriments as well as benefits.  And so you have a variety of these things to get all of the beneficial properties with the minimal detrimental properties.  So sometimes you need strong bases, sometimes you need weak bases. Okay and because in an engine we have weak and strong acids that are there.
101; ;01:02:51,160 --> 01:04:41,580; ;Okay what is a detergent? A detergent is a base. And a base that's commonly used as a calcium base, for instance calcium hydroxide. I'm drawing it sideways for a reason. Calcium and this is plus and this is minus.  And there's two of these minuses for every one of this because this is plus 2. Okay so if you look at that, is that soluble in oil? Remember what I said? The polar things are soluble in water, the non-polar things are soluble in oil.  If something's polar, that means it's not made of carbon and hydrogen; if something's non-polar it's made of carbon and hydrogen. What's that made out of? Calcium, oxygen and hydrogen, is that soluble in oil? No, okay. Though I could take all the base I want to, just dump it in there and it just would have this insoluble mess in the oil. So you have to solubilize the calcium.  And that's what the detergent does.  It has some organic functionality, and then it's got some carbons and hydrogens.  And you get, you surround this thing.
102; ;01:04:41,580 --> 01:08:13,800; ;Okay and you put many of them around there, just like I said happens with the deposit control additives. And if you put things with a bunch of carbons and hydrogens around it, now the outside of this looks like the oil, so it's soluble in the oil.  So a detergent is some amount of base, surrounded by some surfactant or backbone, okay. And the purpose of that stuff is to solubilize the base. Well there's different amounts of this in there; for some applications you want lots of this, for some applications you want not very much. And what the detergents have is these designations to them, which means low over base, low amounts of in this case calcium would be in there.  Medium amounts of it, large amounts of it, and super large amounts of it. And everything has what's called a base number, for the detergent, that depicts what it is. And if it's between 1 and 10, it's almost neutral. If it's between 15 and 30, that means it's going to react with that many acids. It's low. If it's 50 to 150 it's medium, and as you can see the numbers get bigger as the amount of base in there gets higher. So we have a variety of detergents that have those properties. What do these detergents do? Okay so remember I said we get acids from either oxidation from the oil or partial burning of the fuel, and those acids go right to the metal surfaces. Because acids are polar, metals are polar. So it's attracted. Okay now you have a bunch of stuff on here, and if they sit next to each other they're going to make deposits because they're going to be in close proximity; they have reactive functionality and that leads to deposit formation. So what the detergents do is they provide polar things to try to displace some of these acids that are stuck. And they can do that by charging. If you take an acid and you react it with a base, what do you get? What happens when you react an acid and a base? Sonya, I know you know the answer to this. What do you get? What do you get when you react an acid and a base? A salt, right. And the acid is the salt, the acid goes from CO2H to CO2 minus.  Okay, and it's negatively charged. And when you take two negatively charged things, so the base and the detergent cause that to become negatively charged.  And if you take two negative things and you try to push them together, what happens? Where's our muscle man? They repel, they don't like each other. So if you charge these acids up, they just fly off of there. And so that's what the detergent does, it charges the things up. And when it charges them up, they want to be apart. And it keeps them from agglomerating and keeps them from aggregating by charging them up.
103; ;01:08:13,800 --> 01:11:58,940; ;So I just drew these things as little circles with hydrocarbon tails. Well basically they're this, which is an [unintelligible], with some carbon-hydrogen chain and something that allows us to be associated with a metal. And the metal is the parts from the base. So the metal ions, typically we use calcium, magnesium, sodium, or lithium. And we have things that will surround it, which is this on this chart. So we have something that surrounds the base to help it be soluble in the oil, to take the base in there, to neutralize the acids or to prevent deposits from forming. So it's a way to control some of the things that are derived from oxidation.  Okay we have lots of them. And so there's a list there, and again the bold ones are the ones that are more commonly used. But we have calcium; some of them are highly over base, some of them are low over base, some of them highly, highly over base, and some of them contain other things. So this one is the newest one in there, and it's [unintelligible] 10600. And instead of having calcium, like most of the detergents did in the past, it has magnesium.  And there's a phenomena in new engines called LSPI. Okay, and LSPI stands for "Low Speed Pre-Ignition." And what happens is parts of the fuel come in contact with parts of the detergent. And the parts of the fuel are the acids from the fuel, and they come in contact with the detergent which has bases in there, which is supposed to happen, that's how they neutralize them. And it gathers things together. If it gathers parts of these acids together, it can ignite before the spark plug fires. And then that causes a big explosion in your engine, and it'll ruin the engine. And so to do that we were one of the first companies to come out there with what is a magnesium-based detergent. And what does the magnesium-based detergent do? Magnesium is a weaker base than calcium. Remember I said there's weak acids and strong acids? And so if you have a weaker base, you're going to get less salt problems.  So this has just come out, and it's basically to reduce this new engine phenomenon called LSPI. Sometimes we put things in here that give it additional functionality. Like this one says sulfur bridging. What does sulfur do? Remember I just showed you a second ago. Sulfur decompose peroxides, it's an antioxidant. So if you have sulfur in there, it can have two properties.  It can be a detergent backbone or it can be an antioxidant. And a lot of additives are like that, they have more than one functionality and they have multiple purposes.  So some of these contain sulfur.  So there's a wide variety of these. And when Ian and Markston Derwitz, who know about the formulating, this is their challenge. You should question them about the challenges, because they're the ones that are responsible for putting these things together the right way and get all the benefits and to know the detriments.
104; ;01:11:58,940 --> 01:13:26,580; ;Okay if the things start to react, they start to make deposits like I showed you on that valve; or smaller deposits. And we need things in there; those deposits react with each other to keep getting bigger, and bigger, and bigger. And to prevent that from happening, we need to put something around those initially formed deposits to keep from reacting with another one to make this bigger deposit particle, which is harder to clean up. And so what we do to prevent that, and so it's deposit protection, is we put dispersants in the oil. And a deposit is nothing but a carbon framework, it's carbons in the middle and it has some acids on the surface; and so again, it's a weak acid. And so to take that and keep it from bumping into another one, we can just charge it up; remember if we have light charges they fly apart just like the magnets. If they're small, we can do that. But if the carbon framework has gotten so big in the center, even the charging won't overcome that, we need to solubilize it. And that's where we get back to the soap phenomena. Put something that's attracted to the deposit particle to help solubilize it back into the oil, and it has to have all this greasy stuff on the outside just like soap.
105; ;01:13:26,580 --> 01:14:47,640; ;So this is a pictoral...if you're charging things, so the stuff goes to the surface, comes off, charges it - this is all charged; these two things, which would normally react with each other, fly apart. Okay, chemically what are these things? Well remember I said there's acid there, and amines react with acids. I showed you the fuel additive and that had that amine on there, and I showed you a little piece on that and that reacted with the acids on the deposit particles. Dispersants are in the oil and they also have a bunch of nitrogens, depicted by these little circles here. And then there's some big chain on there. And we have a variety of these things with different lengths of chains. And different amounts of nitrogen between these things. The purpose of that is if you got big deposit particles it has to be big molecular weight stuff to [unintelligible], if you have small deposit particles you've got to charge it up. So you don't need much size to it, you want basically just nitrogens to neutralize the acid. Everybody with me? I hope so because there's a quiz next period.
106; ;01:14:47,640 --> 01:15:45,300; ;Okay. So again we have things that are a thousand molecular weight. A thousand molecular weight is getting pretty big, but it's what makes it soluble in the oil and stuff. And we have 1300 molecular weight even bigger, and we have 2300 molecular weight even bigger.  And we do certain things because the nitrogens can also have detrimental properties. If you don't treat them sometimes if you have lots of basic nitrogen, it can cause breakdown of seals. And we don't want that to happen. So it's a band aid for the harm effect of the additive. Again same thing, the bolder ones are most commonly used.
107; ;01:15:45,300 --> 01:17:55,240; ;Okay now I'm going to talk about anti-wear. And anti-wear are things that, remember, we put on the metal surface that makes this hard coating so that when the metals rub against each other they don't cause breaking down of the metal surface, okay? So we put something on there and they're called [unintelligible]; and they make a film that's called a polyphosphate film. And polyphosphate film is a polymer; a hard surface on top of the metal surface. So when the parts rub across each other, you don't take away the metal. And there's a bad thing about these things; remember I said good things and bad things about all these things. If you have a surface, I'm going to draw a metal surface. And you have two metal surfaces and one's going this way and one's stationary, they're going to rub across each other, right? Okay and when they come in contact, that's when you have a wear problem. So we're putting a hard coating on there. And what happens when you put a hard coating on this? You get parts of this now that are contacting that weren't contacting before, because it's bigger. You just put something on top, if you put more rocks on top of the mountain, the mountain gets taller. And so if you make this taller and these things rub across each other, now you're creating friction. So you've prevented the wear, but you've also created friction; we don't want friction because that decreases fuel economy. So you solve one problem, create another problem.
108; ;01:17:55,240 --> 01:18:28,280; ;Okay we have the [unintelligible] phosphates that we use as dispersants, also besides forming polyphosphate films, they have phosphorous and sulfur in there. And what does phosphorous and sulfur do, besides anti-wear things? Peroxide decomposers. Casey did you say that? You get a prize. Thank you.
109; ;01:18:28,280 --> 01:21:58,060; ;So they're susceptible to oxidation and when you oxidize, you can incorporate those in there. And we have different types of zinc dithalphosphates; some have more bulky groups than others. And the ones with the more bulky groups are these, it says C8 and these are C4 to C6. Because the bulkier the groups are on there, the more soluble in the oil they are and the less susceptible to oxidation; they become good oxidation inhibitors. They don't go away right away. So we have these zinc dithalphosphates that make polyphasphate films that add wear protection to the oil. The other thing I said remember is when we perform these polyphosphate films, we create more friction. What are we going to do about that?  Okay well there's basically three types of friction. If the surfaces are far apart, the only thing that impacts this one from sliding across the yellow here is the oil, the gray stuff is the metal surface. To slide across, if this is viscous it's harder for these to slide across that one. So we keep the oil viscosity low when there's no contact involved. When there's integral contact involved, like when I was showing you the wear protection film on there, then the only thing you can do to prevent that is put a graphitic like coating on it. Everybody is familiar with graphite, you can rub layers off and it allows things to slide across each other. Well we use a chemical that's called [unintelligible], and moly sulfite is just like graphite. If you looked at it, its structure would be very similar to the structure of graphite. It allows things to slide across each other; so we have things that impact this type of friction. And I showed these graphitic like layers with this picture down here you can see there's one layer that's attracted to the top layer, but the layers can still slide. It's not attached so strongly that it can't slide across each other. The other thing we can try to do is to keep, as these things get closer to each other, is to put something on top of the metal surface to keep the metal parts from coming in contact with each other. In other words, if we can stick something to the metal and it doesn't create friction, and it keeps the metal apart, you're going to have less friction. You get the friction when the metal comes in contact with each other. So we put molecules on there that interact with each other so that it keeps these metal surfaces farther apart.  And yet it has certain kind of light tail lengths on here; oil can still flow through there and they can still move across each other because they have weak interactions. And we call those mix regime friction modifiers, or organic modifiers. So these aren't metals like aluminum disulfide, but they're carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen and oxygen again.
110; ;01:21:58,060 --> 01:22:34,140; ;So again, a variety of friction modifiers. And the most commonly used one is the mixed regime friction modifier, a low of 17500. And don't forget, 3 regimes of friction, [unintelligible]. For the boundary, these for the mixed, and the oil viscosity when things are far apart. Keeping the oil at that low viscosity state.
111; ;01:22:34,140 --> 01:23:13,100; ;Okay. I said there's a quiz at the end of this. I'm not going to hand you each out a piece of paper and make timings and stuff. But I am going to say let's go through this list. If you have acids form in your oil, how do you get rid of the acids? Remember we talked about antioxidants keeps oxidation from occurring. Anti-wear protects the metal surface. Detergents neutralizes the acids, dispersants keeps the molecules further apart so they don't get...

11; ;00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:14,540; ;We can then share insights with you about your driving behavior and help with any support issues.
12; ;00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:18,160; ;Three: don't forget to buckle up.
13; ;00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:22,980; ;Seatbelts are your best protection against an injury in a crash.
14; ;00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:27,060; ;You could also remind your rider to wear them as well.
15; ;00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:32,320; ;Four: be aware of cyclists and pedestrians.
16; ;00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:40,320; ;When dropping off a rider, it's recommended to remind your riders to check for cyclists before they open their door.
1; ;00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:03,960; ;Please note: these tips are merely suggestions.
2; ;00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:10,600; ;While we encourage partner drivers to use them, you are under no obligation to do so.
3; ;00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:14,220; ;Sleepy Riders
4; ;00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:19,740; ;Uber is a safe and reliable option for riders to get home late at night.
5; ;00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:23,800; ;Because of this, some may fall asleep during the trip.
6; ;00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:28,680; ;If that happens, avoid shaking the rider awake.
7; ;00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:33,680; ;Shaking may startle them, especially if it's done by something they don't recognize.
8; ;00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:42,340; ;Instead you may want to use audible cues, such as calling their name, clapping your hands, or playing loud music.
9; ;00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:50,140; ;If the rider has a friend with them, or one waiting at the destination, you can ask for the friend's help with the rider.
10; ;00:00:50,140 --> 00:01:02,760; ;In the rare event that the rider remains unresponsive, or you're concerned for their well-being, contact emergency services in your area to assist before reporting the incident to Uber.
1; ;00:00:01,220 --> 00:00:08,091; ;Throughout the module, you'll see discussion questions sprinkled in as well as review questions.
2; ;00:00:08,091 --> 00:00:20,648; ;And the concept with those is just to give you an idea of material that's going to be upcoming, maybe you know the answer, maybe you don't - but we will cover what the answers are in the upcoming slides.
3; ;00:00:20,648 --> 00:00:23,414; ;So here's our first discussion question in the module.
4; ;00:00:23,414 --> 00:00:27,391; ;Can anyone name the different models in the SC Series?
5; ;00:00:27,391 --> 00:00:33,112; ;So, again, some of you may know this from your experience with the SC Series.
6; ;00:00:33,112 --> 00:00:41,223; ;If you've watched the SC Series Architecture Technical Overview, that e-learning module, you'd probably know these.
7; ;00:00:41,223 --> 00:00:45,078; ;I'll give you a minute think about that, and then we'll reveal the answer.
8; ;00:00:45,078 --> 00:00:57,284; ;SCv2000, SC4020, SC7020, which is our latest release, SC8000, and SC9000.
9; ;00:00:57,284 --> 00:01:02,784; ;And we'll talk about each of these in a little more detail as we go through this module.
10; ;00:01:02,784 --> 00:01:09,514; ;Before we get into more details on each of the models, let's give you a quick view of the SC Series elevator pitch.
11; ;00:01:09,514 --> 00:01:18,255; ;This would be just a 10, 15 second pitch on where the SC Series fits in a prospect's environment.
12; ;00:01:18,255 --> 00:01:20,575; ;So what is the SC Series elevator pitch?
13; ;00:01:20,575 --> 00:01:26,613; ;Well, really what it is is the SC Series solutions are self-optimizing.
14; ;00:01:26,613 --> 00:01:37,892; ;They use intelligent data placement to put the right data, at the right place, at the right time, to maximize storage performance and lower total cost of ownership.
15; ;00:01:37,892 --> 00:01:48,422; ;And throughout the different modules in this series, we'll explain how the SC Series does put the right data, at the right place, at the right time.
16; ;00:01:48,422 --> 00:01:59,067; ;That self-optimizing that we mentioned in the elevator pitch, that's really possible throughout all of the different models that are in the SC Series.
17; ;00:01:59,067 --> 00:02:10,855; ;And that is because of the single stack architecture, we're able to expand the breadth and depth and use the same management interface throughout all of the different five value tiers.
18; ;00:02:10,855 --> 00:02:17,687; ;Okay, as we said, there's one core operating system through that, it's called the Storage Center Operating System.
19; ;00:02:17,687 --> 00:02:23,544; ;You'll hear that referred to often in the modules SCOS.
20; ;00:02:23,544 --> 00:02:26,829; ;And this provides unified management.
21; ;00:02:26,829 --> 00:02:30,319; ;Also, there's modular hardware in a lot of the different models.
22; ;00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:35,821; ;Okay, so the SC Series really provides multiple right-sized solutions.
23; ;00:02:35,821 --> 00:02:41,172; ;And these solutions can grow and evolve with your business.
24; ;00:02:41,172 --> 00:02:44,759; ;As we said, each solution has unified management.
25; ;00:02:44,759 --> 00:02:57,916; ;So the beauty of that is a customer can start small and grow, but be familiar with the same management interface as his business grows.
26; ;00:02:57,916 --> 00:03:07,236; ;Again, because of the single stack architecture, here are some of the things that all of the systems, all of the different models in the SC Series have in common.
27; ;00:03:07,236 --> 00:03:26,429; ;They all have virtualized architecture, they all have self-optimized RAID tiering, they all incorporate different thin methods, there is end-to-end management, broad third-party integrations that's growing all the time, as well as flash support.
28; ;00:03:26,429 --> 00:03:34,243; ;Every one of the five different models supports flash.
29; ;00:03:34,243 --> 00:03:37,397; ;And you see five times growth over five years.
30; ;00:03:37,397 --> 00:03:41,411; ;We've really developed a position within the industry.
31; ;00:03:41,411 --> 00:03:52,594; ;We have some great flash leadership, and really the market space for us is the SMB to mid-market space with the SC Series.
32; ;00:03:52,594 --> 00:04:00,117; ;Here is a screenshot of all of the five different models available in the SC Series.
33; ;00:04:00,117 --> 00:04:08,077; ;And they range from the SMB, small-to-medium-sized business, up to basically the mid-market with the SC9000.
34; ;00:04:08,077 --> 00:04:16,480; ;What I'd like you to think about is think about two different features of each model.
35; ;00:04:17,530 --> 00:04:21,560; ;These features could be the same from one model to the next.
36; ;00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:28,586; ;Ideally, they'd be unique features, but as we talked about, it's one storage center operating system throughout all five.
37; ;00:04:28,586 --> 00:04:32,900; ;So some of them, you know, may be the same with each.
38; ;00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:35,740; ;Let's start with the SCv2000.
39; ;00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:41,222; ;I want you to sort of give that some thought and then we'll show you what we get here.
40; ;00:04:41,222 --> 00:04:43,989; ;Let's click on that SCv2000.
41; ;00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:49,080; ;And hopefully, you got a couple of these points, intelligent, entry-level solution.
42; ;00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:59,285; ;This is our small customer, kind of our gateway into a prospect, kind of the low-to-mid-market price point.
43; ;00:04:59,285 --> 00:05:08,260; ;Again, you can start small, you can scale up in this model with a low total cost of ownership, and it's very flexible and easy to manage.
44; ;00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:12,190; ;Hopefully you've got a couple of those in the SCv2000.
45; ;00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:17,133; ;All right, as we move from left to right, how about the SC4020?
46; ;00:05:17,133 --> 00:05:20,825; ;Okay, let's see what the SC4020 has for us.
47; ;00:05:20,825 --> 00:05:26,989; ;Again, sort of think about a couple of options here, a couple of features of the SC4020.
48; ;00:05:28,468 --> 00:05:31,112; ;Hopefully you, again, came up with a couple of these.
49; ;00:05:31,112 --> 00:05:34,794; ;It's a mid-market solution with scalable performance.
50; ;00:05:34,794 --> 00:05:40,792; ;It's an all-in-one offering, which is really the same thing as the SCv2000 series is.
51; ;00:05:40,792 --> 00:05:46,510; ;It's an all-in-one offering that has both controllers and disk space in a single 2U chassis.
52; ;00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:50,384; ;You can expand beyond that single chassis.
53; ;00:05:50,384 --> 00:05:57,254; ;But initially, it's got 24 2.5-inch internal drive slots.
54; ;00:05:57,254 --> 00:06:05,344; ;It's got embedded serial attached SCSI, SAS, right, back-end for expansion.
55; ;00:06:05,344 --> 00:06:13,061; ;You can do Network Attached Storage with it, you can attach an FS8600 to it as well.
56; ;00:06:13,061 --> 00:06:15,828; ;It does support Fibre Channel and iSCSI.
57; ;00:06:15,828 --> 00:06:27,099; ;It's really a great way to extend the value proposition of high-end storage to mid-size deployments.
58; ;00:06:27,099 --> 00:06:33,645; ;Also, it's a great solution for remote offices or back offices, ROBOs as we refer to them.
59; ;00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:41,340; ;It can be a combination of SSD drives, all SSD drives.
60; ;00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:46,304; ;It can be all spinning disk or any combination thereof.
61; ;00:06:46,304 --> 00:06:54,683; ;So very fast data access and workloads, offers best-in-class intelligence and control.
62; ;00:06:54,683 --> 00:07:01,288; ;And we'll talk a little bit more about the SC4020 and there's a hardware module as part of this as well.
63; ;00:07:01,288 --> 00:07:07,453; ;We'll talk a little bit more, a little more of a deep dive on the SC4020 in that module.
64; ;00:07:08,702 --> 00:07:15,052; ;The latest release of the Storage Center Operating System is Version 7.1 as of this recording.
65; ;00:07:15,052 --> 00:07:24,902; ;And in 7.1, the SC4020 supports direct connect to a SAS server through the front end.
66; ;00:07:24,902 --> 00:07:40,978; ;And again, we'll talk a little bit more about that in that hardware module, but just wanted to make you aware of that that the SC4020 does support, as of SCOS 7.1, it does support SAS direct connectivity to a server.
67; ;00:07:42,165 --> 00:07:52,541; ;Speaking of SCOS 7.1, that will bring us up to our most recent release in the SC Series family, and that is the SC7020.
68; ;00:07:52,541 --> 00:07:58,406; ;And again, it does require SCOS 7.1 to operate.
69; ;00:07:58,406 --> 00:08:02,859; ;That's the minimum version of SCOS on this box.
70; ;00:08:02,859 --> 00:08:04,888; ;So what is the SC7020?
71; ;00:08:04,888 --> 00:08:10,475; ;It's dual controllers and enclosures in a 3U chassis.
72; ;00:08:10,475 --> 00:08:14,186; ;So it can hold up to 30 enclosures.
73; ;00:08:14,186 --> 00:08:24,053; ;As you may recall, the SCv2000 and the SC4020, they are 2U - they can support up to a maximum of 24 drives.
74; ;00:08:24,053 --> 00:08:33,210; ;The SC7020 is 3U and it supports up to 30 drives, or up to 3 petabytes, in a single chassis.
75; ;00:08:33,210 --> 00:08:40,373; ;It does support the back-end of 12 gigs, so SC400 and SC420 enclosures.
76; ;00:08:40,373 --> 00:08:45,284; ;It supports those, as does the SC9000.
77; ;00:08:45,284 --> 00:08:55,118; ;SC200, SC220, and SC280, those are all 6 gig enclosures and they also can work on the back-end of SC7020.
78; ;00:08:55,118 --> 00:09:01,092; ;You can actually go as many as 500 drives if you add the expansion enclosures.
79; ;00:09:01,092 --> 00:09:07,965; ;So 6 gig enclosures, 6 gig SAS will work with 12 gig HBAs.
80; ;00:09:07,965 --> 00:09:18,266; ;So that's where you can use either really any five of these enclosures to add to that 500 drives in the initial 3U.
81; ;00:09:18,266 --> 00:09:22,696; ;That's how we get up to that 3 petabyte mark.
82; ;00:09:22,696 --> 00:09:25,034; ;Again, it's a mid-market price point.
83; ;00:09:25,034 --> 00:09:31,394; ;It does provide multi-protocol networks, Fibre Channel and iSCSI are the two that it supports.
84; ;00:09:31,394 --> 00:09:39,955; ;In that 3U chassis, it's a pretty efficient solution because you've got everything in the 3U - it's all right there.
85; ;00:09:39,955 --> 00:09:43,192; ;It's really a great TCO experience because of that.
86; ;00:09:44,411 --> 00:09:49,342; ;Next step in the SC Series is the SC8000.
87; ;00:09:49,342 --> 00:09:53,638; ;Again, try to think of a couple of features of the SC8000.
88; ;00:09:55,112 --> 00:09:58,451; ;And let's go in and click into here and take a look.
89; ;00:09:58,451 --> 00:10:13,586; ;It's really targeted at, again, mid-market customers who need a little more performance optimization and a little more resiliency than either the SC4020 or the SC7020.
90; ;00:10:13,586 --> 00:10:15,860; ;You can go up to 3 petabytes.
91; ;00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:24,480; ;Now notice from an expandability standpoint, I've got SC200, SC220, and SC280.
92; ;00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,580; ;So this supports a 6 gig back-end enclosures.
93; ;00:10:27,582 --> 00:10:32,858; ;Remember, that the 400 and the 420 are our 12 gig enclosures.
94; ;00:10:32,858 --> 00:10:36,776; ;Now it talks about modular components for greater flexibility.
95; ;00:10:36,776 --> 00:10:37,791; ;And that's what you're seeing.
96; ;00:10:37,791 --> 00:10:40,198; ;So you're seeing dual controller here.
97; ;00:10:40,198 --> 00:10:49,079; ;And then the enclosures are physically connected there - they're connected over SAS cables to these two controllers.
98; ;00:10:49,079 --> 00:10:54,310; ;That's what we talk about when we talk about modular components, that's what we mean.
99; ;00:10:54,310 --> 00:11:06,440; ;The enclosures are not built in to the controllers as the SCv2000, SC4020, and SC7020 systems were.
100; ;00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:12,040; ;And this does offer the advantage of greater flexibility on the back-end, right?
101; ;00:11:12,044 --> 00:11:28,552; ;It maximizes storage by lowering the total cost of ownership by using that self-optimizing intelligent software to put the right data, at the right place, at the right time, perpetual licensing model.
102; ;00:11:28,552 --> 00:11:38,757; ;And it's a resilient, highly available solution that supports Fibre Channel, iSCSI, and Fibre Channel over Ethernet.
103; ;00:11:38,757 --> 00:11:43,623; ;And then finally to finish off the SC Series, we have the SC9000.
104; ;00:11:43,623 --> 00:11:47,429; ;Think of a couple of features of the SC9000.
105; ;00:11:47,429 --> 00:11:50,729; ;And then we'll reveal what the answers are.
106; ;00:11:52,655 --> 00:11:56,426; ;Go ahead and click on the SC9000 here.
107; ;00:11:56,426 --> 00:12:06,509; ;As it says there, it's designed for mid-market customers who have heavier workloads, because really this is the flagship of the SC Series family.
108; ;00:12:06,509 --> 00:12:12,557; ;It is based on Dell's R730 servers, which are Dell's top-of-the-line servers.
109; ;00:12:12,557 --> 00:12:16,591; ;So these are the two controllers in an SC9000.
110; ;00:12:16,591 --> 00:12:20,373; ;Similar to an SC8000, these are modular in nature.
111; ;00:12:20,373 --> 00:12:27,367; ;So you have the two controllers here and the storage, the disks are housed in enclosures.
112; ;00:12:27,367 --> 00:12:37,865; ;Okay, so those enclosures are all part of the solution and the enclosures allow you to expand up to 3 petabytes on the SC9000.
113; ;00:12:37,865 --> 00:12:47,957; ;Notice that you have the SC400 and SC420, or the 12 gig enclosures, are supported on here just like they were on the SC7020.
114; ;00:12:47,957 --> 00:12:59,305; ;One thing you might recall, the SC8000 did not support the 12 gig, but here on the SC9000, you have either 12 gig or 6 gig expandability on the back-end.
115; ;00:12:59,305 --> 00:13:06,171; ;From a front-end connectivity perspective, we've got Fibre Channel, iSCSI, and FCoE.
116; ;00:13:06,171 --> 00:13:09,767; ;And you'll see a few enhancements here over the SC8000.
117; ;00:13:09,767 --> 00:13:17,849; ;You have up to four times more memory than the SC8000 and 40% more IOPS than the SC8000.
118; ;00:13:17,849 --> 00:13:26,181; ;So it's definitely an improvement over that model and that's why it is really the flagship of the SC Series line.
119; ;00:13:26,181 --> 00:13:34,624; ;It really allows our customers to scale up and out via that single interface to configure and manage deployments.
120; ;00:13:34,624 --> 00:13:46,907; ;And again, as we said it in the beginning, you can go from an SCv2000 all the way up to the SC9000 and still manage it through that single interface.
121; ;00:13:46,907 --> 00:13:51,060; ;As promised, it's time for a couple of review questions.
122; ;00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:58,986; ;So our first one: which SC Series is a 3U, dual controller system at a mid-market price point?
123; ;00:13:58,986 --> 00:14:07,578; ;I'll give you a moment to think about that, but that was the first, that's the most recent solution in the SC Series family - that's the SC7020.
124; ;00:14:07,578 --> 00:14:08,598; ;Good.
125; ;00:14:08,598 --> 00:14:12,179; ;Which SC Series solution targets entry level customers?
126; ;00:14:12,179 --> 00:14:20,003; ;Now that had been on the far left of the five tiers - SCv2000 series.
127; ;00:14:20,003 --> 00:14:26,922; ;And then finally, which SC Series solution is a great option for remote office or back office?
128; ;00:14:26,922 --> 00:14:29,625; ;We called out one specifically for that.
129; ;00:14:29,625 --> 00:14:31,846; ;Yeah, SC4020.
130; ;00:14:31,846 --> 00:14:33,013; ;Good.
1; ;00:00:01,091 --> 00:00:05,584; ;Let's start our discussion by looking at the SCv2000 series.
2; ;00:00:05,584 --> 00:00:13,985; ;And it's important to note that it is an SCv2000 series, or the SCv2000 family which is our entry level product.
3; ;00:00:13,985 --> 00:00:21,059; ;There are three different members of the family, so we've been kind of talking about SCv2000 but there are actually three pieces to that.
4; ;00:00:21,059 --> 00:00:30,293; ;There is SCv2000, all of these by the way, you'll notice are SCv2000 is 2U with up to 12 drives.
5; ;00:00:30,293 --> 00:00:35,233; ;The SCv2020 is 2U with up to 24 drives.
6; ;00:00:35,233 --> 00:00:41,977; ;And finally, the SCv2080 is 5U with up to 84 drives.
7; ;00:00:41,977 --> 00:00:47,750; ;And we'll be talking about each of these drives and each of these models in the next couple slides.
8; ;00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:53,748; ;We'll start our look at the SCv2000 family by looking at the SCv2000 itself.
9; ;00:00:53,748 --> 00:01:00,112; ;So it's a 2U enclosure with up to 12 3.5-inch SAS connected disk drives.
10; ;00:01:00,112 --> 00:01:07,637; ;You can actually go with 2.5-inch drives in here, they would be in the 3.5-inch carrier.
11; ;00:01:07,637 --> 00:01:15,435; ;You have an option of selling 2.5-inch or 3.5-inch drives, but there is a maximum of 12 no matter which way you go.
12; ;00:01:15,435 --> 00:01:19,555; ;There is a minimum number of drives and that is seven.
13; ;00:01:19,555 --> 00:01:23,303; ;So the minimum number of drives in SCv2000 is seven.
14; ;00:01:23,303 --> 00:01:25,812; ;There is an ops panel on each unit.
15; ;00:01:25,812 --> 00:01:28,402; ;You kind of see it up here.
16; ;00:01:28,402 --> 00:01:37,235; ;That ops panel is just for troubleshooting from a diagnostic standpoint, what's going on in the array.
17; ;00:01:37,235 --> 00:01:41,344; ;The SCv2000 has room for two controllers.
18; ;00:01:41,344 --> 00:01:44,508; ;See the number three there, there is a top and a bottom.
19; ;00:01:44,508 --> 00:01:48,445; ;Controller one is on the top, controller two is on the bottom.
20; ;00:01:48,445 --> 00:01:55,220; ;It also comes with dual power supplies and a fan assembly, so power supply unit.
21; ;00:01:55,220 --> 00:02:06,404; ;And of course, the advantage of the power supply, dual power supplies is that if one were to fail then the system would keep up and running from the other power supply.
22; ;00:02:06,404 --> 00:02:11,032; ;So one power supply will keep up the SCv2000.
23; ;00:02:11,032 --> 00:02:13,901; ;The SCv2000 has been around a while.
24; ;00:02:13,901 --> 00:02:19,363; ;The minimum software release is 6.6.2.
25; ;00:02:19,363 --> 00:02:24,940; ;And then we're going to talk a little bit more about connectivity in the next few slides.
26; ;00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:28,833; ;Now let's take a look at the SCv2020.
27; ;00:02:28,833 --> 00:02:48,234; ;As you can see, it's really the SCv2000 and the SCv2020 are pretty much the same, the only difference is the 2020 handles 2.5-inch drives, so you can have up to 24 2.5-inch - a 3.5-inch drive is not supported in the SCv2020.
28; ;00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:59,100; ;The same minimum, I have a minimum number of drives of seven and again, just like the SCv2000, we can have spinning disks, or SSDs, or any combination of the two, same kind of ops panel as we saw in the 2000.
29; ;00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:02,840; ;Same kind of ops panel as we saw in the 2000.
30; ;00:03:02,929 --> 00:03:10,761; ;And just like the SCv2000, I've got two controller canisters, now a customer can purchase one if they want.
31; ;00:03:10,761 --> 00:03:11,947; ;Okay, so that is an option.
32; ;00:03:11,947 --> 00:03:14,523; ;Most of our customers purchase two.
33; ;00:03:14,523 --> 00:03:24,456; ;It's pretty unusual actually where a customer would only purchase one, but that is an option and it might come in handy because this is really our low-end storage array.
34; ;00:03:24,456 --> 00:03:29,704; ;Also the two power supplies just like the SCv2000 as well.
35; ;00:03:29,704 --> 00:03:46,238; ;With either the SC2000 or SC2020, you have the ability to add more drives to the enclosure, so you're not limited to 12 or 24 drives depending on what model you choose, you can expand that with either of these type of enclosures.
36; ;00:03:46,238 --> 00:03:52,044; ;There is the SC100 and the SC120.
37; ;00:03:52,044 --> 00:04:04,956; ;Actually the maximum number of drives on an SCv2000 or SCv2020 is actually 168.
38; ;00:04:04,956 --> 00:04:07,886; ;And we'll talk little bit more about that in an upcoming slide.
39; ;00:04:07,886 --> 00:04:25,857; ;But you see the front and the back of the SC100 and the SC120, and one thing to call out we do, as mentioned on the bottom of the slide there, SC100 and SC120 are only supported as expansion units for the SCv2000 or SCv2020, meaning they're not sold separately.
40; ;00:04:25,857 --> 00:04:32,002; ;Also they can't be added to any other line in the SC Series.
41; ;00:04:32,002 --> 00:04:41,462; ;So for example, you can't add an SC100 or SC120 to an SC4020 for example.
42; ;00:04:42,984 --> 00:04:57,347; ;And we'll talk about those when we discuss the 4020, but just be aware that the SC100 and SC120 are not sold separately and they're only used for expansion of the SCv2000 or SCv2020 lines.
43; ;00:04:57,347 --> 00:05:05,209; ;They can be mixed and matched as expansion units for either one, so you do have that kind of flexibility as well.
44; ;00:05:05,209 --> 00:05:17,231; ;Let's look at a slide regarding what's involved with adding expansion cabinets, adding those SC100 or SC120 enclosures to an SCv2000 or SCv2020.
45; ;00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:25,500; ;So if you look at the back-end cabling, up to 13 SC100 expansion enclosures can be connected.
46; ;00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:36,100; ;And again, remember, they can go on SCv2000 or SCv2020, but I can go as high as 13 of the SC100, so I can go up to six SC120s.
47; ;00:05:36,101 --> 00:05:42,936; ;And remember, SC120 is the one that had 24 drives in the enclosure so I can go up to six there.
48; ;00:05:42,936 --> 00:05:50,589; ;A maximum, we mentioned this earlier on the last slide, a maximum of 168 physical drives are supported.
49; ;00:05:50,589 --> 00:05:57,568; ;And then as of release 6.6 and that is still the same raw capacity total today.
50; ;00:05:57,568 --> 00:06:20,115; ;So 672 terabytes is the maximum capacity and then the actual addressable capacity - which again also remains the same as of the current release of SCOS - which again as of this recording is SCOS 7.1, the addressable capacity maximum is 450 terabytes.
51; ;00:06:20,115 --> 00:06:26,637; ;The last member of the SCv2000 family is SCv2080.
52; ;00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:34,140; ;And really that the SCv2080 was designed for - yes, they're entry level customers but they need a large amount of data.
53; ;00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:37,740; ;So that's the intent of the SCv2080.
54; ;00:06:37,744 --> 00:06:44,716; ;Again, it has two controllers, unlike the SCv2000 and the SCv2020.
55; ;00:06:44,716 --> 00:06:50,355; ;They do require dual controllers, so you can't purchase an SCv2080 with only one.
56; ;00:06:51,419 --> 00:06:57,784; ;There's a maximum of 84 drives in the SCv2080.
57; ;00:06:57,784 --> 00:07:03,137; ;And they can be 2.5-inch or 3.5-inch, either one - but that's the maximum number of drives.
58; ;00:07:03,137 --> 00:07:12,086; ;Just like we had seen with the SCv2000, it's a 2.5-inch drive would go into a 3.5-inch case, okay, that's the concept.
59; ;00:07:12,086 --> 00:07:13,916; ;So I can have up to 84.
60; ;00:07:13,916 --> 00:07:16,911; ;There is a minimum amount of drives here as well.
61; ;00:07:16,911 --> 00:07:24,397; ;The minimum number of drives on an SCv2080 is 28, so 28 minimum, 84 is the maximum.
62; ;00:07:24,397 --> 00:07:32,547; ;And when you add more drives, you add them in increments of 14, and it's mainly due to thermal considerations.
63; ;00:07:32,547 --> 00:07:41,199; ;We include the weight on here just because of the installation process for an SCv2080, it really requires two people.
64; ;00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:48,974; ;You can see the weight of a SCv2080, just empty is 137 pounds and at max configuration is 287 pounds.
65; ;00:07:48,974 --> 00:08:00,709; ;So it's much heavier than the SCv2000 and the SCv2020, so definitely we require two people to install it.
66; ;00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,640; ;And much more cooling, still have two power supplies.
67; ;00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:07,030; ;It will run if one of the power supplies fails.
68; ;00:08:07,033 --> 00:08:14,493; ;And we're going to talk a little bit more coming up about connectivity to host on each of these as SCv models.
69; ;00:08:14,493 --> 00:08:18,103; ;The SCv2080 can be expanded as well.
70; ;00:08:18,103 --> 00:08:24,990; ;The type of enclosure that is added to an SCv2080 is in SC180.
71; ;00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:37,981; ;So again, similar to what we've just discussed, the SC100 and SC120, the SC180 is the enclosure that can be added to the SCv2080.
72; ;00:08:37,981 --> 00:08:40,918; ;If I want to add additional storage, that's what I have to use.
73; ;00:08:40,918 --> 00:08:48,605; ;Just like the SC100 and SC120, this is not sold separately.
74; ;00:08:48,605 --> 00:08:53,558; ;The SC180, and it can only be added to an SCv2080.
75; ;00:08:53,558 --> 00:09:01,628; ;You cannot add an SC180 enclosure to any other model in the SC Series lineup.
76; ;00:09:01,628 --> 00:09:08,630; ;So it won't work on a SC4020 or SC7020, in SC8000 or a SC9000.
77; ;00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:14,618; ;It will only work on the SCv2080.
78; ;00:09:14,618 --> 00:09:21,712; ;Again, just as we talked about, this enclosure contains 84 drives - it has to have a minimum of 28.
79; ;00:09:21,712 --> 00:09:27,220; ;And drives can be added in increments of 14.
80; ;00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:41,327; ;The maximum number of drives just as we'd seen on the other two models in the SCv family is 168 and that is, again, the latest release of SCOS 7.1.
81; ;00:09:41,327 --> 00:09:45,233; ;Let's talk for a moment about the concept of disk folders.
82; ;00:09:45,233 --> 00:09:52,456; ;So in an SC Series, disk folders are used for managing and organizing physical disk drives.
83; ;00:09:52,456 --> 00:10:00,780; ;In order to be recognized by the Storage Center Operating System, physical disks have to be assigned to a disk folder.
84; ;00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:07,460; ;This is true in all of the products from SCv2000 all the way through SC9000.
85; ;00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:20,160; ;The physical disk drives have to be set up in disk folders and the software facilitates that and it's fairly easy process, but that's the requirement.
86; ;00:10:20,161 --> 00:10:31,433; ;Specifically then to the SCv2000 and SCv2020, all disk folders have to have a minimum of seven drives of the same type.
87; ;00:10:31,433 --> 00:10:37,811; ;If I've got different drive types, they have to be in different disk folders.
88; ;00:10:37,811 --> 00:10:41,669; ;Just let's look at a couple of examples here.
89; ;00:10:41,669 --> 00:10:55,163; ;Seven or more of the same drive type: so for example, if I had an SCv2000 with 7 4 terabyte 7.2K drives, they would be in one disk folder.
90; ;00:10:55,163 --> 00:11:09,407; ;If I had an SCv2020 with 7 900 gig 10K drives and 17 600 gig 15K drives, they would be in 2 separate folders.
91; ;00:11:09,407 --> 00:11:17,647; ;Both would be supported because I've got at least seven in each, but they would be in two separate disk folders because they're different drives.
92; ;00:11:17,647 --> 00:11:31,773; ;A couple of unsupported configurations, if I had an SCv2020 for example with seven 4 terabyte drives and five 3 terabyte drives in a single track, in a single chassis.
93; ;00:11:31,773 --> 00:11:43,278; ;Since there are two separate drive types, that means I would have to have two disk folders and since I only have 5 of the 3 terabyte drives, that's not enough.
94; ;00:11:43,278 --> 00:11:48,760; ;I would have to add two more drives then I would have two separate disk folders.
95; ;00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:49,854; ;I could have the one.
96; ;00:11:49,854 --> 00:11:53,275; ;The 4 terabyte drives, I have 7, I'd be good.
97; ;00:11:53,275 --> 00:11:58,135; ;But the other one, since I only have 5 of the 3 terabytes would not be.
98; ;00:11:58,135 --> 00:12:07,425; ;So just something to kind of keep in mind as you're selling the product, you know, the SCv series to a customer.
99; ;00:12:07,425 --> 00:12:14,832; ;Let's take a little closer look at the SCv2000 series controller canister module.
100; ;00:12:14,832 --> 00:12:17,740; ;Remember, that most customers get two of these.
101; ;00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:30,211; ;And this of course, we're just showing one here, but keep in mind that when the SCv2000 series products are shipped, these controllers look like they're upside down.
102; ;00:12:30,211 --> 00:12:38,172; ;Each controllers identical to the other one, and if you look at it, it looks like the second one is upside down, that's normal.
103; ;00:12:38,172 --> 00:12:47,808; ;As we look at each of the components, there's the battery on the far left here which keeps the write-cache up in case of a system failure.
104; ;00:12:47,808 --> 00:12:54,158; ;Ten gig Ethernet for management, used for system management and replication.
105; ;00:12:54,158 --> 00:12:57,437; ;And we'll talk a little bit more about that as we go through.
106; ;00:12:57,437 --> 00:13:01,859; ;Mini SAS connectors, now these are 6 gig connectors.
107; ;00:13:01,859 --> 00:13:08,526; ;So that's what we're connecting on the SCv2000 is 6 gig connection to the back-end.
108; ;00:13:08,526 --> 00:13:20,580; ;So as we're showing in SCv2000 here connecting either a SC100 or SC120 enclosure, in either case those are 6 gig.
109; ;00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:32,425; ;Also, there is internal connectivity between the controllers as well, so what you have is you have a SAS cable between controller one and controller two.
110; ;00:13:32,425 --> 00:13:44,035; ;So if I've got a dual controller system in an SCv2000 series model, I have to direct connect between each of the controllers with a SAS cable.
111; ;00:13:45,352 --> 00:13:50,347; ;It provides that internal drive connectivity, between the controllers.
112; ;00:13:51,817 --> 00:13:55,311; ;That's if I don't have any expansion enclosures.
113; ;00:13:55,311 --> 00:14:03,870; ;If I add a SC100 or SC120 then I don't need that, but if I don't then I need that cable between the two controllers.
114; ;00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:06,802; ;And then PCIe HBA.
115; ;00:14:06,802 --> 00:14:11,946; ;Of course, this is going to vary depending on what type of controller is in the solution.
116; ;00:14:11,946 --> 00:14:18,138; ;This example we're showing 1 gig Ethernet connectivity for iSCSI to the hosts.
117; ;00:14:18,138 --> 00:14:20,895; ;This is going to be our front-end connection.
118; ;00:14:20,895 --> 00:14:31,804; ;This connectivity would go out into an Ethernet switch and then out to the actual front-end servers themselves.
119; ;00:14:31,804 --> 00:14:35,835; ;The serial port is on the SCv2000 controller.
120; ;00:14:35,835 --> 00:14:44,406; ;That's typically used for initial configuration, in fact, that is what has to be used for initial configuration of the SCv2000.
121; ;00:14:44,406 --> 00:14:54,927; ;But also if you want to certainly hang on to that cable as troubleshooting might need to occur from copilot or someone else from Support.
122; ;00:14:54,927 --> 00:14:58,924; ;Let's take a look at the SCv2000 controller types.
123; ;00:14:58,924 --> 00:15:04,369; ;As you can see there, there are five different controller types and we're going to take a look at each of those.
124; ;00:15:04,369 --> 00:15:08,560; ;And these are chosen by the customer at the time of order.
125; ;00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:14,577; ;The first one on the top there is the 4-port 1 gig iSCSI.
126; ;00:15:14,577 --> 00:15:27,118; ;And you can see that we've got it highlighted there in the circle and this is what would tell you to look on the controller, 1G iSCSI-4, so that's 1 gig iSCSI 4 ports, that would denote that.
127; ;00:15:27,118 --> 00:15:39,341; ;And now both controllers would be the same, so you can't mix that these controllers have one controller be one type and another controller be the other type, okay, so that's the first one.
128; ;00:15:39,341 --> 00:15:43,481; ;You can have the 1 gig iSCSI.
129; ;00:15:43,481 --> 00:15:47,740; ;The next one is a 10 gig iSCSI and there would be 2 ports.
130; ;00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:49,663; ;So you see the two ports there.
131; ;00:15:49,663 --> 00:15:54,334; ;Again, 10 gig iSCSI 2 ports, so you kind of get the idea there.
132; ;00:15:54,334 --> 00:15:59,453; ;The next one up is 4-port 12 gig SAS.
133; ;00:15:59,453 --> 00:16:04,776; ;Remember, the SCv2000 supports SAS controllers to servers.
134; ;00:16:04,776 --> 00:16:09,174; ;So 12G SAS-4, so you see the four ports there.
135; ;00:16:09,174 --> 00:16:14,274; ;That would be 4-port 12 gig SAS, also Fibre Channel supported.
136; ;00:16:14,274 --> 00:16:22,040; ;I have 8 gig Fibre Channel as you're seeing here and then I have 16 gig Fibre Channel.
137; ;00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:33,072; ;Both of those are options in the SCv2000 series, of course, now the 16-port Fibre Channel will auto-negotiate down to 8 gig.
138; ;00:16:33,072 --> 00:16:42,095; ;And it's the same thing with the 10 gig iSCSI, they will auto-negotiate down to 1 gig if they're installed in a 1 gig network.
139; ;00:16:42,095 --> 00:16:47,751; ;The SCv2000 series has an option that we refer to as flex ports.
140; ;00:16:47,751 --> 00:16:53,695; ;What the flex port option is, is software enabled iSCSI ports.
141; ;00:16:53,695 --> 00:17:01,966; ;What we're really talking about here is these two ports here, the management, and REPL or replication.
142; ;00:17:01,966 --> 00:17:14,840; ;It is a license feature on the SCv2000 that allows a customer the ability to have those 2 10 gig ports act as both management and iSCSI.
143; ;00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:27,131; ;You look at the example here, you have the ability to have Fibre Channel and iSCSI in the same controller, that's what the flex port option gives you.
144; ;00:17:27,131 --> 00:17:36,813; ;If you didn't have the flex port option, remember, this would just be used for replication only and then this would just be used for management.
145; ;00:17:36,813 --> 00:17:46,229; ;The flex port option gives you, as the name suggests, much more flexibility and how you want to set up your controllers on the SCv2000.
146; ;00:17:46,229 --> 00:17:53,321; ;This is showing Fibre Channel here but of course, this could be any of your five choices that we just talked about.
147; ;00:17:53,321 --> 00:18:04,470; ;This is showing 8 gig Fibre Channel, it could be 16 gig Fibre Channel or if you have simply an iSCSI network, this could be all iSCSI or of course, it could even be SAS.
148; ;00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:10,837; ;Let's take a look at some front-end connectivity things to consider with an SCv2000 series.
149; ;00:18:10,837 --> 00:18:18,232; ;The first thing is the SCv2000 does not support direct connect Fibre Channel or iSCSI.
150; ;00:18:18,232 --> 00:18:27,057; ;As you can see here this is a Fibre Channel example and this would be an ideal, this is the recommended setup for failover.
151; ;00:18:27,057 --> 00:18:41,029; ;Where I've got two switches, I've got two ports on each controller going to one switch, two ports on each controller going to the other switch, then up to a dual port HBA in the server.
152; ;00:18:41,029 --> 00:18:50,372; ;One further level of redundancy, of course, is you could have a second server up here and have a second switch go to a second server.
153; ;00:18:50,372 --> 00:18:52,147; ;But the key is having two different switches.
154; ;00:18:52,147 --> 00:18:58,904; ;This is showing Fibre Channel but these could be Ethernet switches as well if you're going to run iSCSI.
155; ;00:18:58,904 --> 00:19:07,813; ;The other way to go as far as a front-end connectivity on an SCv2000 is SAS.
156; ;00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:14,225; ;The SAS connection does support direct connect, so that's what you're showing in the example here.
157; ;00:19:14,225 --> 00:19:22,630; ;I've got two different servers and I'm directly connecting from my SAS connections, these are 12 gig SAS connections.
158; ;00:19:22,630 --> 00:19:31,813; ;They are supported on Dell's 13G server, so these pictured are 13G Dell servers.
159; ;00:19:31,813 --> 00:19:41,565; ;So they won't work on 12G Dell server, it has to be a 13G.
160; ;00:19:41,565 --> 00:19:51,633; ;And that's why a Dell 6 gig SAS HBAs are not supported with the SCv2000 series, it is strictly a 12 gig SAS.
161; ;00:19:51,633 --> 00:19:59,995; ;But again, you can go direct connect into the server, you don't have to go through a switch with SAS connection.
162; ;00:19:59,995 --> 00:20:13,748; ;Of course, there is much more detailed wiring diagrams in the user guide, it just give us just a quick review of a wiring example, but there's a lot much more details in the guide.
163; ;00:20:13,748 --> 00:20:16,513; ;All right, so let's go through some review questions.
164; ;00:20:16,513 --> 00:20:23,259; ;On a SCv2020, what is the minimum number of drives required in a disk folder?
165; ;00:20:23,259 --> 00:20:24,935; ;Remember, we talked about that.
166; ;00:20:24,935 --> 00:20:26,141; ;Seven.
167; ;00:20:26,141 --> 00:20:28,237; ;Yep, minimum seven.
168; ;00:20:28,237 --> 00:20:32,376; ;Remember that all drives have to be in a disk folder.
169; ;00:20:32,376 --> 00:20:38,444; ;What enclosure model - or models - can be added to an SCv2000?
170; ;00:20:38,444 --> 00:20:41,739; ;Remember that one?
171; ;00:20:41,739 --> 00:20:45,556; ;SC100, SC120.
172; ;00:20:45,556 --> 00:20:49,772; ;Those can be added to an SCv2000.
173; ;00:20:49,772 --> 00:20:50,984; ;Good.
174; ;00:20:50,984 --> 00:20:56,201; ;True or false: Flex ports are a licensed feature on SCv2000.
175; ;00:20:56,201 --> 00:20:57,670; ;So we just talked about that.
176; ;00:20:57,670 --> 00:21:00,302; ;And indeed, that is true.
177; ;00:21:00,302 --> 00:21:02,487; ;Okay, good.
178; ;00:21:02,487 --> 00:21:05,653; ;Here is a discussion question, something you can think about.
179; ;00:21:05,653 --> 00:21:10,918; ;Which SC Series model can be installed by customers?
180; ;00:21:10,918 --> 00:21:17,464; ;Okay, we haven't really talked about this, so it's just something that you might want to kind of think about, maybe you know the answer to it.
181; ;00:21:17,464 --> 00:21:18,479; ;We just discussed those.
182; ;00:21:18,479 --> 00:21:22,067; ;The SCv2000 series.
183; ;00:21:23,922 --> 00:21:28,918; ;So the SCv2000, the SCv2020, the SCv2080.
184; ;00:21:28,918 --> 00:21:37,927; ;And remember what we said about the SCv2080, we want to make sure that there are two people involved with that installation just because of the weight of the enclosures.
185; ;00:21:37,927 --> 00:21:39,059; ;Good.
1; ;00:00:01,886 --> 00:00:05,738; ;All right, so next up, we're going to talk about the SC4020.
2; ;00:00:05,738 --> 00:00:09,405; ;Let's take a more detailed look now at the SC4020.
3; ;00:00:09,405 --> 00:00:17,812; ;So it's really large-scale advantages for mid-size deployments, and we've seen the SCv2000 series.
4; ;00:00:17,812 --> 00:00:20,363; ;And the SC4020 is similar.
5; ;00:00:20,363 --> 00:00:29,073; ;It's one of three all-in-one array offerings in the SC Series, meaning that they have both controllers and disk space in a single chassis.
6; ;00:00:29,073 --> 00:00:31,553; ;SCv2000 series is one.
7; ;00:00:31,553 --> 00:00:36,160; ;There's SC4020, and the SC7020, which we'll talk about next.
8; ;00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:40,594; ;Those are the three that are all-in-one array offerings.
9; ;00:00:40,594 --> 00:00:47,092; ;So as we look at what the SC4020 looks like, dual hot swappable controllers.
10; ;00:00:47,092 --> 00:00:53,747; ;As we said, all-in-one array with dual controllers and disk space in a single chassis.
11; ;00:00:53,747 --> 00:00:59,256; ;Initially, you've got 24 2.5-inch drives and you can mix those.
12; ;00:00:59,256 --> 00:01:05,333; ;They can be SSDs, they can be spinning disk, or any combination thereof.
13; ;00:01:05,333 --> 00:01:11,040; ;The front-end connectivity out to servers Fibre Channel, iSCSI, and SAS.
14; ;00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:17,916; ;The SAS functionality is part of the SCOS 7.1 release.
15; ;00:01:17,916 --> 00:01:23,874; ;So it's very comparable from a connectivity standpoint to the SCv2000 series.
16; ;00:01:23,874 --> 00:01:37,225; ;The SAS back-end, 6-gig SAS on the back-end, and that 6-gig SAS, we'll be talking about the different expansion enclosures, the SC200, SC220, and SC280.
17; ;00:01:37,225 --> 00:01:49,590; ;You have optional NAS support, so you can put an FS8600 on the front-end here and have this serve as a NAS engine as well.
18; ;00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:55,017; ;Fibre Channel and iSCSI replication, you can do either one from the SC4020.
19; ;00:01:55,017 --> 00:02:03,521; ;So it's really a mid-market solution with very scalable performance because you can add these different enclosures if you need to.
20; ;00:02:05,436 --> 00:02:15,561; ;With adding the expansion enclosures, the 4020 will scale up to 192 drives and raw space availability of 1 petabyte.
21; ;00:02:15,561 --> 00:02:20,556; ;That's why we say it's really large-scale advantages for mid-sized deployments.
22; ;00:02:20,556 --> 00:02:31,633; ;As we said, spinning disks, SSDs, they can be all HDDs, they can be all SSDs, or they can be a combination thereof.
23; ;00:02:31,633 --> 00:02:36,516; ;Built-in an optional perpetually licensed software.
24; ;00:02:36,516 --> 00:02:40,083; ;That's another huge advantage of the SC4020.
25; ;00:02:40,083 --> 00:02:50,161; ;The SC Series, we don't make you upgrade the license somewhere down the line in order to upgrade the product, okay.
26; ;00:02:50,161 --> 00:02:53,413; ;Greater than 100,000 IOPS in 2U.
27; ;00:02:53,413 --> 00:03:05,370; ;Very fast data access and workloads, especially if we start talking about using an all flash array in the solution.
28; ;00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:23,404; ;The other thing that the SC4020 provides is powerful best-in-class intelligence with automated efficiency and control, because you can do multi-tier flash capability in the SC4020.
29; ;00:03:23,404 --> 00:03:28,813; ;It uses the SC Series patented Data Progression.
30; ;00:03:28,813 --> 00:03:39,332; ;So you can have multi-tier solution within the SC4020, perfect for remote office or some type of back office functionality.
31; ;00:03:39,332 --> 00:03:53,961; ;It's really designed for mid-sized customers who need a cost-effective self-optimizing storage solution that will put the data at the right place at the right time.
32; ;00:03:53,961 --> 00:03:56,554; ;That's the whole idea with the SC4020.
33; ;00:03:56,554 --> 00:03:59,912; ;Let's take a look at the SC4020.
34; ;00:03:59,912 --> 00:04:02,638; ;This shows us the front and back view.
35; ;00:04:02,638 --> 00:04:08,967; ;So from the front, you can see 24 2.5-inch drive slots.
36; ;00:04:08,967 --> 00:04:18,652; ;With the ability to add expansion enclosures, you can have up to 192 drives in the SC4020.
37; ;00:04:18,652 --> 00:04:31,694; ;4020 was released with SCOS version 6.6, SCOS version 7.1, it's the same, that max of 192 drives.
38; ;00:04:31,694 --> 00:04:37,851; ;The PCI slots are found on both of the controller canisters.
39; ;00:04:37,851 --> 00:04:42,447; ;You can see here that we have our multiple connectivity options.
40; ;00:04:42,447 --> 00:04:44,717; ;We'll talk more about those on the next slide.
41; ;00:04:44,717 --> 00:04:50,784; ;These are showing 10-gig iSCSI on these two.
42; ;00:04:50,784 --> 00:04:56,257; ;The MGMT and iSCSI ports are 10-gig Ethernet.
43; ;00:04:56,257 --> 00:05:04,129; ;And just to call out here, you may have remembered on the SCv2000, we saw management and replication, REPL.
44; ;00:05:04,129 --> 00:05:17,228; ;That will be either REPL or iSCSI, depending on how the customer purchased the front-end connections.
45; ;00:05:17,228 --> 00:05:24,583; ;The MGMT port IP address by default is used for accessing the 4020, so that's how you manage the array.
46; ;00:05:24,583 --> 00:05:30,624; ;The REPL or iSCSI port, again, depends on the type of front-end card purchased.
47; ;00:05:30,624 --> 00:05:33,518; ;By default, it's used for iSCSI replication.
48; ;00:05:33,518 --> 00:05:39,955; ;We have the flex port option here, and we'll discuss more about that flex port option in an upcoming slide.
49; ;00:05:39,955 --> 00:05:44,590; ;It's very similar to what we just saw on the SCv2000.
50; ;00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:57,239; ;And again, these are 10 gig ports and they can automatically negotiate down to 1 gig, 6-gig SAS for back-end connectivity to any kind of expansion enclosures.
51; ;00:05:57,239 --> 00:06:05,562; ;Keep in mind, if there's no expansion enclosures, we have to have a SAS cable running between the two controllers.
52; ;00:06:05,562 --> 00:06:09,770; ;So when you're initially setting it up, that's part of the connectivity.
53; ;00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:13,127; ;They have to basically close that loop.
54; ;00:06:13,127 --> 00:06:23,030; ;So we don't see it necessarily in the picture here, but you have to connect those two if we don't have any expansion enclosures as part of it, okay?
55; ;00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:33,610; ;The MGMT and REPL or iSCSI ports can be used for management, replication, or for generating traffic to an iSCSI server.
56; ;00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:39,279; ;This discussion of flex ports, that we'll talk about in an upcoming slide.
57; ;00:06:39,279 --> 00:06:45,079; ;The SC4020 has different controller types as well, five different controller types.
58; ;00:06:45,079 --> 00:06:51,642; ;This slide will look very familiar with the SCv2000 series controller type slides.
59; ;00:06:51,642 --> 00:07:02,687; ;A lot of that really is part of the SCOS 7.1 release that brought us these controller-type similarities between the two.
60; ;00:07:02,687 --> 00:07:06,039; ;It wasn't necessarily that way until SCOS 7.1.
61; ;00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:12,500; ;So we've got four-port 1-gig iSCSI, two-port 10-gig iSCSI.
62; ;00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:23,530; ;Here we've got four-port 12 gig SAS, four-port 8-gig Fibre Channel, and then two-port 16-gig Fibre Channel.
63; ;00:07:23,539 --> 00:07:29,294; ;So both of these too became available as of SCOS 7.1.
64; ;00:07:29,294 --> 00:07:35,952; ;If your customer has an older version than that, they won't be able to use those two functionalities.
65; ;00:07:35,952 --> 00:07:43,605; ;And of course, in particular the four-port 12-gig SAS, which is the direct connect, just like on the SCv2000 models.
66; ;00:07:43,605 --> 00:07:46,813; ;Front-end connectivity considerations on the 4020.
67; ;00:07:46,813 --> 00:08:04,916; ;This slide is going to look very similar to the SCv2000 front-end connectivity slide in that same type of functionality here where we've got either 8-gig Fibre Channel, that's what this example is, 16-gig Fibre Channel or 1-gig or 10-gig iSCSI.
68; ;00:08:04,916 --> 00:08:09,442; ;In either case, all of those have to go through a switch.
69; ;00:08:09,442 --> 00:08:14,505; ;The 4020 does support direct connection to a SAS server.
70; ;00:08:14,505 --> 00:08:27,280; ;As of SCOS 7.1, we do have the functionality to direct connect 12-gigs SAS HBAs into a Dell 13G server.
71; ;00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:33,894; ;Just like the SCv2000, SC4020 supports the functionality of flex ports.
72; ;00:08:33,894 --> 00:08:52,742; ;Just like on the SCv2000, flex ports are software-enabled iSCSI ports, which allows a customer the ability to have two 10-gig Ethernet ports labeled MGMT and REPL or replication.
73; ;00:08:52,742 --> 00:09:11,284; ;And then one thing to note on that, one big difference between the SC4020 flex port functionality and the SCv2000 flex port functionality is that flex ports come standard as part of the SC4020 software package.
74; ;00:09:11,284 --> 00:09:15,992; ;If you remember, they're a licensed functionality on the SCv2000.
75; ;00:09:15,992 --> 00:09:24,645; ;They work the same way, but they come standard on the 4020, optional or a license feature on the SCv2000.
76; ;00:09:24,645 --> 00:09:39,290; ;Just to sort of clarify the MGMT, REPL functionality that we talked about here, remember that we said this could say REPL or potentially iSCSI.
77; ;00:09:39,290 --> 00:09:49,988; ;If the PCIe HBA is an iSCSI card like it shows here, that label will say REPL.
78; ;00:09:49,988 --> 00:09:58,296; ;If the PCIe HBA is a Fibre Channel card, the label will say iSCSI instead of REPL like it does here.
79; ;00:09:58,296 --> 00:10:04,808; ;If the PCIe HBA is a SAS card, the label will also say iSCSI.
80; ;00:10:04,808 --> 00:10:13,036; ;So it just depends how the customer ordered the PCI cards.
81; ;00:10:13,036 --> 00:10:19,575; ;Notice that the flex ports come standard on the 4020 as opposed to licensed on the SCv2000.
82; ;00:10:19,575 --> 00:10:24,681; ;As we said, expansion enclosures can be added to the SC4020.
83; ;00:10:24,681 --> 00:10:31,610; ;And two of the expansion enclosures that can be added are SC200 and SC220.
84; ;00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:37,754; ;The SC4020 solution has one SAS chain on it.
85; ;00:10:37,754 --> 00:10:47,719; ;That SAS chain can hold up to 192 drives, so I can mix and match the 200 and the 220.
86; ;00:10:47,719 --> 00:10:54,953; ;The difference between the two, the SC200, right, it has 3.5-inch drives.
87; ;00:10:54,953 --> 00:10:57,577; ;So I can have a maximum of 12.
88; ;00:10:57,577 --> 00:11:00,473; ;You can kind of see that here, this is an SC200.
89; ;00:11:00,473 --> 00:11:08,455; ;The SC220, I can have up to 24 drives, and they're 2.5-inch drives, okay.
90; ;00:11:08,455 --> 00:11:11,313; ;They can be mixed together on the same chain.
91; ;00:11:11,313 --> 00:11:22,794; ;One thing I want to call your attention to, and maybe some of you have noticed this as we've gone through the presentation, but I just wanted to call it out as far as kind of a tip on our naming convention.
92; ;00:11:22,794 --> 00:11:40,430; ;Notice that if the product ends in 20 - so for example, if you remember, 120, SC120 were enclosures you could add to the SCv2000, 4020, right, the model number, 220, you see here.
93; ;00:11:40,430 --> 00:11:43,001; ;Remember SCv2020?
94; ;00:11:43,001 --> 00:11:59,678; ;That 20 is the last numbers of any type of model denotes that 2.5-half inch drives are in the product, whatever it is, whether it be an enclosure like a 220,or SCv2020, or SC 4020.
95; ;00:11:59,678 --> 00:12:05,198; ;All of those have 2.5-inch as opposed to the 00 on the end.
96; ;00:12:05,198 --> 00:12:09,328; ;As you see here, SC200 is 3.5-inch drives.
97; ;00:12:09,328 --> 00:12:20,946; ;Remember the SC100 was 3.5-inch enclosures that could be added to the SCv, to make that an SCv2000, such as the SCv2000.
98; ;00:12:20,946 --> 00:12:25,026; ;That base unit has 3.5-inch drives.
99; ;00:12:25,026 --> 00:12:29,210; ;So if it ends in 20, it's going to have 2.5-inch drives.
100; ;00:12:29,210 --> 00:12:39,062; ;If the model ends in 00, it's going to have 3.5-inch drives, so just a little tip there to kind of help you figure out some of the modeling.
101; ;00:12:39,062 --> 00:12:46,485; ;The next type of enclosure that can be added to an SC4020 is an SC280 enclosure, which we're seeing here.
102; ;00:12:46,485 --> 00:12:49,902; ;In the SC280, there are two drawers per enclosure.
103; ;00:12:49,902 --> 00:12:54,249; ;They contain 42 drives per drawer - that's the max.
104; ;00:12:54,249 --> 00:13:04,802; ;There are two different configurations you can use, that would be 84 drives, 42 in each drawer, or 42 drives total, which would be 21 drives in each drawer.
105; ;00:13:04,802 --> 00:13:08,422; ;Those are our options with the SC280.
106; ;00:13:08,422 --> 00:13:10,018; ;This is a 6-gig enclosure.
107; ;00:13:10,018 --> 00:13:17,760; ;Two 6-gigs SAS EBOD modules, five fan modules for cooling, and two power supply units.
108; ;00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:27,323; ;Just as we saw with the SC180, which is what you can add to an SCv2080, they are heavy.
109; ;00:13:27,323 --> 00:13:34,851; ;They weigh approximately 137 pounds without drives, almost 290 pounds fully loaded.
110; ;00:13:34,851 --> 00:13:41,404; ;It really takes two people to install an SC280 enclosure into a rack.
111; ;00:13:41,404 --> 00:13:44,510; ;Let's look at a few specifications in the SC280.
112; ;00:13:44,510 --> 00:13:49,622; ;It's 5U, 3.5-inch drives in the 280s.
113; ;00:13:49,622 --> 00:13:55,131; ;They are 4 or 6 terabytes, those are the size of the drives, 7,200 RPM.
114; ;00:13:55,131 --> 00:14:00,572; ;As we said previously, there can be 42 or 84 drives, depending on how you want to do it.
115; ;00:14:00,572 --> 00:14:07,978; ;And enclosures that can be attached to the SC4020, I can have two SC280s attached to the end.
116; ;00:14:07,978 --> 00:14:09,701; ;They're going to be in the same chain.
117; ;00:14:09,701 --> 00:14:14,795; ;Remember that an SC4020 has a total of one chain.
118; ;00:14:14,795 --> 00:14:17,837; ;So the maximum number of enclosures I can have is two.
119; ;00:14:17,837 --> 00:14:19,677; ;I can have four hot spares.
120; ;00:14:19,677 --> 00:14:28,697; ;That's generally how we recommend setting up an SC280 are four hot spares between the enclosures.
121; ;00:14:28,697 --> 00:14:33,637; ;The SC4020 has several flexible expansion options.
122; ;00:14:33,637 --> 00:14:43,274; ;So you can start with the base unit of the SC4020, as we said, it's an all-in-one 2U array, 24 2.5-inch drives.
123; ;00:14:43,274 --> 00:14:49,584; ;So I have a minimum of 6 and a maximum of 24 within that SC4020 chassis.
124; ;00:14:49,584 --> 00:14:59,572; ;I can add, right, as we talked about, SC200, SC220, or SC280 expansion enclosures.
125; ;00:14:59,572 --> 00:15:10,959; ;And those enclosures can be a combination of SC220 or SC200 to get to that 192 drive max because, remember again, I have that single SAS chain.
126; ;00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:18,395; ;Note here, if the SC280 enclosures are quoted, they cannot be mixed with an SC200 or an SC220.
127; ;00:15:18,395 --> 00:15:23,975; ;And that's because SC280 enclosures have to be on their own chain.
128; ;00:15:23,975 --> 00:15:31,580; ;Since the 4020 only supports a single chain, it would be SC280, and that would be all.
129; ;00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:38,533; ;But you can mix and match the SC200 and 220 as expansion enclosures on the SC4020.
130; ;00:15:38,533 --> 00:15:41,792; ;Let's talk about licensing in the SC4020.
131; ;00:15:41,792 --> 00:15:46,174; ;So it's slightly different than in the 8000 and 9000 series.
132; ;00:15:46,174 --> 00:15:50,224; ;We really focus on software convenience and value.
133; ;00:15:50,224 --> 00:15:56,401; ;And a lot of that value comes from the base license is 48 drives.
134; ;00:15:56,401 --> 00:16:01,627; ;Remember that the 4020 in its 2U form holds 24.
135; ;00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:07,399; ;So you can add an expansion cabinet, up to 48 drives would be the base license.
136; ;00:16:07,399 --> 00:16:15,127; ;And then you can expand in 24-drive increments up until you get to 97.
137; ;00:16:15,127 --> 00:16:24,083; ;So 97 drives and above in an array in an SC4020 constitutes what we refer to as an enterprise capacity license.
138; ;00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:25,961; ;And I don't need any further license.
139; ;00:16:25,961 --> 00:16:37,514; ;If you take a look at the licensing and the software that's included, it's a pretty healthy string of features here just in the SCOS Core.
140; ;00:16:37,514 --> 00:16:43,744; ;I have the Core OS, SCOS 7.1 is, as we said, the current release.
141; ;00:16:43,744 --> 00:16:51,421; ;Data Capacity and Controllers, the Data Instant Replay, deduplication and Compression is part of the Core.
142; ;00:16:51,421 --> 00:16:57,708; ;Local data protection, local snapshotting, Virtual Ports, and Dell Storage Manager.
143; ;00:16:57,708 --> 00:17:00,241; ;All of that is part of that SCO Core.
144; ;00:17:00,241 --> 00:17:07,224; ;There is an Optimization bundle which includes Data Progression and Fast Track.
145; ;00:17:07,224 --> 00:17:23,353; ;There is a Remote Data Protection bundle, which is going to include the Core and the Optimization bundle as well as Remote Instant Replay and Live Volume, which are both part of the Remote Data Protection bundle.
146; ;00:17:23,353 --> 00:17:30,371; ;There's a couple of one-time array based licenses, there's an Application Protection Manager Suite.
147; ;00:17:30,371 --> 00:17:40,028; ;And the Application Protection Manager Suite is going to include Application Protection Manager for Oracle, as well as Replay Manager for Windows.
148; ;00:17:40,028 --> 00:17:46,670; ;It also includes the encryption as part of one-time array based licenses.
149; ;00:17:46,670 --> 00:17:53,157; ;There's also licensing for chargeback feature, which is part of the Dell Storage Manager.
150; ;00:17:53,157 --> 00:17:56,961; ;And here you can just select based on the number of servers.
151; ;00:17:56,961 --> 00:18:02,665; ;If you have more than eight servers, you want to incorporate in the chargeback functionality.
152; ;00:18:02,665 --> 00:18:04,779; ;That would be an unlimited license.
153; ;00:18:04,779 --> 00:18:10,430; ;But you can choose the number of servers that you might want to include in chargeback.
154; ;00:18:10,430 --> 00:18:13,087; ;It's time to go through some review questions now.
155; ;00:18:13,087 --> 00:18:20,875; ;Number one, what is the maximum amount., the maximum number, excuse me, of internal drive slots available in an SC4020 chassis?
156; ;00:18:22,337 --> 00:18:23,975; ;Yep, 24.
157; ;00:18:23,975 --> 00:18:27,715; ;Good, 24 2.5-inch drives.
158; ;00:18:27,715 --> 00:18:35,398; ;What Fibre Channel speeds are supported in an SC4020 as of SCOS 7.1?
159; ;00:18:35,398 --> 00:18:43,244; ;So prior to 7.1, we only had one speed, now we've got two, so it's 8 gig and 16 gig.
160; ;00:18:43,244 --> 00:18:44,488; ;Good.
161; ;00:18:44,488 --> 00:18:51,587; ;And then finally, true or false: Flex ports are a licensed feature on an SC4020?
162; ;00:18:51,587 --> 00:18:53,086; ;And that's false, right?
163; ;00:18:53,086 --> 00:18:57,147; ;So they come standard on the base license on an SC4020.
164; ;00:18:57,147 --> 00:19:02,841; ;Flex ports, remember on an SCv2000 series are a licensed feature.
1; ;00:00:01,558 --> 00:00:06,783; ;Here's a discussion question as we launch into the next model that we'll take a look at.
2; ;00:00:06,783 --> 00:00:16,278; ;What SC Series model provides over 2 petabytes of usable flash storage in a 3U chassis, okay?
3; ;00:00:16,278 --> 00:00:24,621; ;And as we've talked about earlier with discussion questions, you may know it, you may not, but we'll be talking about this right after this slide.
4; ;00:00:24,621 --> 00:00:28,070; ;So it's SC7020, okay?
5; ;00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:37,661; ;And that's what we're going to talk about now, the SC7020, which is the latest release in the SC Series line.
6; ;00:00:37,661 --> 00:00:40,927; ;The SC7020, let's take a closer look at it now.
7; ;00:00:40,927 --> 00:00:46,940; ;So dual controllers and up to 30 drives in a 3U chassis.
8; ;00:00:46,940 --> 00:01:00,707; ;And as you'll recall, the SCv2000 and the SC4020 had dual controllers and up to 24 drives in a 2U chassis, so this is the next level up if you will.
9; ;00:01:00,707 --> 00:01:09,098; ;Space saving certainly, easier from a cabling perspective with the all-in-one chassis.
10; ;00:01:09,098 --> 00:01:11,498; ;We've got six PCI slots.
11; ;00:01:11,498 --> 00:01:21,027; ;It supports multi-protocol networks, Fibre Channel or iSCSI, either one, 12 gig SAS back-end.
12; ;00:01:21,027 --> 00:01:28,834; ;The 12 gig SAS back-end of course will support 6 gig connectivity as well.
13; ;00:01:28,834 --> 00:01:36,464; ;So I can use the SC400 or SC420, and we'll talk a little bit more about those coming up, those are 12 gig enclosures.
14; ;00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:47,160; ;And I have the ability to add on the SC200, SC220, and SC280 enclosures, the closures we just talked about on to this as well.
15; ;00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:55,500; ;Because even though that might be a 12 gig card in the SC7020, it will support 6 gig, it will auto negotiate down to 6 gig.
16; ;00:01:55,506 --> 00:01:58,311; ;So it supports either one.
17; ;00:01:58,311 --> 00:02:01,193; ;As we said, 30 drive slots, dual controllers.
18; ;00:02:01,193 --> 00:02:08,197; ;With the expansion cabinets available, I can expand up to 3 petabytes of raw capacity.
19; ;00:02:08,197 --> 00:02:19,370; ;And SCOS 7.1 is the software release that you have to be running in order to install and use an SC7020.
20; ;00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:29,406; ;So more capacity, greater flexibility than we saw with either the SCv2000 series or the SC4020.
21; ;00:02:29,406 --> 00:02:36,416; ;You can expand your front and back-end connectivity, support up to 500 drives in the SC7020.
22; ;00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:44,023; ;It's 7.1, so it does have the functionality of dedupe and compression along with federation support.
23; ;00:02:44,023 --> 00:02:51,565; ;Kind of the efficiency involved with a single cabinet, I have less hardware to monitor and manage.
24; ;00:02:51,565 --> 00:02:54,097; ;So it's a great TCO.
25; ;00:02:54,097 --> 00:03:05,291; ;The last thing from a performance standpoint, our internal tests showed up to 290,000 IOPS, that was using disk speed analysis.
26; ;00:03:05,291 --> 00:03:09,549; ;It definitely has some great performance numbers as well.
27; ;00:03:09,549 --> 00:03:18,131; ;Let's look at some highlights then of the SC7020, dual 2.5 gigahertz eight core processors.
28; ;00:03:18,131 --> 00:03:24,432; ;So we've beefed up the processors on the SC7020 along with the memory.
29; ;00:03:24,432 --> 00:03:32,223; ;We've got 128 gig per controller for a total of 256 gig of system memory, you know, for the whole array.
30; ;00:03:32,223 --> 00:03:49,861; ;You have a choice of all-flash solution, a flash-optimized solution, or hybrid configurations, or all spinning disks as well, so multiple ability, multiple flexible options in terms of drive support in the SC7020.
31; ;00:03:49,861 --> 00:03:53,965; ;Again, as we said, 30 2.5 inch drives.
32; ;00:03:53,965 --> 00:04:01,341; ;You can expand up to 500 drives in the array, supports iSCSI and Fibre Channel.
33; ;00:04:01,341 --> 00:04:04,635; ;I can expand on the front-end or the back-end.
34; ;00:04:04,635 --> 00:04:08,783; ;And we'll take a look at the front and the backside in a couple of slides coming up.
35; ;00:04:08,783 --> 00:04:19,345; ;And from a software perspective, single pane of glass using the Dell Storage Manager will manage all of the SC7020 features.
36; ;00:04:19,345 --> 00:04:28,363; ;Self-optimized architecture, auto-tiering, intelligent deduplication and compression, all of this which is part of SCOS 7.1.
37; ;00:04:28,363 --> 00:04:31,757; ;It's a simplified licensing model as well.
38; ;00:04:31,757 --> 00:04:35,500; ;It's per drive based on the core base license.
39; ;00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:40,215; ;We'll look a little bit at that coming up in the next couple slides.
40; ;00:04:40,215 --> 00:04:47,453; ;Let's continue our overview of the SC7020 by looking at both the front and the back of the SC7020.
41; ;00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:53,341; ;As we said, we've got 30 drives, 30 2.5-inch internal drive slots, that's what you're seeing here.
42; ;00:04:53,341 --> 00:05:01,478; ;Remember, we can increase the amount with the expansion cabinets up to 500 drives.
43; ;00:05:01,478 --> 00:05:06,383; ;So let's look at some of the other features, most of the rest of the good stuff is on the back.
44; ;00:05:06,383 --> 00:05:10,217; ;One of two power supplies is here, here's the other power supply.
45; ;00:05:10,217 --> 00:05:20,006; ;If we lose one of the power supplies, the other power supply is powerful enough to keep the SC7020 up and running.
46; ;00:05:20,006 --> 00:05:25,899; ;Two controller canister modules: one up on the top, two on the bottom.
47; ;00:05:25,899 --> 00:05:33,335; ;There are three PCIe Gen 3 IO cabinet slots per controller.
48; ;00:05:33,335 --> 00:05:40,762; ;The slots are two-port or four-port, they can be either full height or half length.
49; ;00:05:40,762 --> 00:05:47,107; ;One thing that's interesting, the ordered cards will be shipped pre-installed at the factory.
50; ;00:05:47,107 --> 00:05:57,193; ;And any one of the slots in either one of the controllers can be used for front-end or back-end IO expansion.
51; ;00:05:57,193 --> 00:06:04,321; ;So other ways of expanding then, we've got four 10 gig iSCSI front-end mezzanine.
52; ;00:06:04,321 --> 00:06:08,551; ;There's a mezzanine card built-in that runs 10 gig iSCSI.
53; ;00:06:08,551 --> 00:06:16,906; ;The 10 gig iSCSI, the mezz card can be either SFP+ or RJ45.
54; ;00:06:16,906 --> 00:06:26,590; ;A key takeaway though is you have to make that decision, the customer has to make that decision when they place the order for the SC7020.
55; ;00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:33,725; ;So once they make that call, the mezz card can't be changed after that selection is made, so just sort of a heads up on that end.
56; ;00:06:33,725 --> 00:06:41,354; ;There's also two on-board 12 gig back-end SAS expansion ports.
57; ;00:06:41,354 --> 00:06:56,006; ;As we said earlier that the 12 gig expansion, they'll auto-negotiate down to 6 gig, so we can have 400, 420, 200, 220, and 280 enclosures added on to the back-end of the SC7020.
58; ;00:06:56,006 --> 00:07:08,842; ;One other difference between the 7020 and the 4020 and the SCv2000 series is you don't have to connect a cable between the two SAS ports here.
59; ;00:07:08,842 --> 00:07:17,519; ;If you recall, you have to do that on both of the 4020 and the SCv2000 models if there are no expansion enclosures added on.
60; ;00:07:17,519 --> 00:07:24,779; ;Here if there's no expansion enclosures added on, you don't need that cable between the two in the single enclosure.
61; ;00:07:24,779 --> 00:07:27,727; ;So there's no cross connecting of the enclosure.
62; ;00:07:27,727 --> 00:07:30,859; ;That's a difference between the two.
63; ;00:07:30,859 --> 00:07:41,217; ;And a 1 gig management port which, as the name implies, handles the management of the SC7020 from the Dell Storage Manager.
64; ;00:07:41,217 --> 00:07:44,354; ;Here are some SC7020 technical specifications.
65; ;00:07:44,354 --> 00:07:49,216; ;Certainly not going to read all these to you, you can take a look at them at your leisure.
66; ;00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:58,220; ;A couple things to call out, one is the memory, 128 gig per controller, as we know 256 gig per array in the dual controller system.
67; ;00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:02,840; ;That memory is battery-backed, so it's cache-to-flash.
68; ;00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:11,061; ;The battery holds the system up just long enough to perform a cache to nonvolatile flash operation.
69; ;00:08:11,061 --> 00:08:24,190; ;Just a couple of differences between the SC7020 and then the 8000 and 9000, those systems have a dedicated PCIe card that's used for write cache.
70; ;00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:29,878; ;In the SC7020, write cache is actually part of memory.
71; ;00:08:29,878 --> 00:08:36,871; ;Each controller pulls 32 gig of write cache from the 128 gig of memory.
72; ;00:08:36,871 --> 00:08:40,654; ;So just, you know, be aware of that.
73; ;00:08:40,654 --> 00:08:54,715; ;Notice, the mezz card that we just talked about, remember, you have to make that call SFP+ or RJ45 when it's initially when the customer purchases the SC7020.
74; ;00:08:54,715 --> 00:09:02,657; ;See the supported enclosures, the 500 max per array, minimum of 4 drives in an SC7020.
75; ;00:09:02,657 --> 00:09:06,842; ;It's a little different than the 4020 which where we had to have 6.
76; ;00:09:06,842 --> 00:09:16,083; ;And then you see the SCOS core software and optional features in the SC7020 from a licensing standpoint.
77; ;00:09:16,083 --> 00:09:20,447; ;We'll talk more in more detail about that in the next slide.
78; ;00:09:20,447 --> 00:09:26,977; ;So before we talk about licensing, let's talk a little bit about expansion options in the SC7020.
79; ;00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:33,060; ;Now this is our first look here at the SC400 and SC420.
80; ;00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:38,480; ;You'll notice if you look at them, they look very much the same as SC200 and SC220.
81; ;00:09:38,481 --> 00:09:48,422; ;And really the only difference is these, the 400 and 420 are 12 gig throughput as opposed to 6 gig, which are the SC200 and SC220.
82; ;00:09:48,422 --> 00:09:52,325; ;So that's where you see two times the bandwidth of previous enclosure.
83; ;00:09:52,325 --> 00:09:54,177; ;That's really what that means.
84; ;00:09:54,177 --> 00:10:06,966; ;In the SC400 and SC420, I can intermix write intensive SSDs, read Intensive SSDs, HDDs which are spinning disks, there are dual management modules in each.
85; ;00:10:06,966 --> 00:10:13,185; ;Now I can also have the 6 gig in not only the 200 and 220 but also the SC280.
86; ;00:10:13,185 --> 00:10:20,437; ;And as we know, the SC280 gives us the best hard disk density, 100 terabytes per U.
87; ;00:10:20,437 --> 00:10:24,441; ;It's ideal for cold or archival storage.
88; ;00:10:24,441 --> 00:10:35,821; ;All right so one thing to keep in mind is yes, I can add 200 or 220 or 280 to the SC7020.
89; ;00:10:35,821 --> 00:10:40,712; ;However, they have to be on separate chains.
90; ;00:10:40,712 --> 00:10:50,711; ;I can have chains with 200 and 220 and 280 on them, and I can have chains with SC400 and SC420 on them.
91; ;00:10:50,711 --> 00:10:53,868; ;So just be aware of that.
92; ;00:10:53,868 --> 00:11:04,440; ;And of course, as we've talked about earlier, the 12 gig card, right, will support 6 gig SAS enclosures.
93; ;00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:08,091; ;So you don't necessarily have to worry about that, but just keep that in mind.
94; ;00:11:08,091 --> 00:11:19,982; ;The other thing remember to keep in mind in the 6 gig space is the SC280 needs to be on a separate chain from the SC200 and the SC220, okay, as we discussed that earlier as well.
95; ;00:11:19,982 --> 00:11:21,470; ;So keep that in mind.
96; ;00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:26,611; ;Realistically, you probably would focus on the SC400 and SC420 for 12 gig.
97; ;00:11:26,611 --> 00:11:33,542; ;And if you wanted that ultra dense enclosure, you could suggest an SC280 for a customer.
98; ;00:11:33,542 --> 00:11:37,382; ;And the SC280 or a pair of them would be on a separate chain.
99; ;00:11:37,382 --> 00:11:42,723; ;And the SC400 and SC420 would be on a separate chain as well.
100; ;00:11:42,723 --> 00:11:46,320; ;Let's talk about licensing in the SC7020.
101; ;00:11:46,320 --> 00:12:00,701; ;In the way that the licensing in the 7020 is done, it's much simpler than even in the 4020 or even in the 8000 and 9000, so you can reduce the total cost of ownership just the way the licensing is handled.
102; ;00:12:00,701 --> 00:12:04,507; ;There's really two approaches to licensing in the 7020.
103; ;00:12:04,507 --> 00:12:06,857; ;Per drive is the first one we'll look at.
104; ;00:12:06,857 --> 00:12:13,191; ;And with per drive, you purchase exactly the number of drives that you need - no more, no less.
105; ;00:12:13,191 --> 00:12:19,730; ;Now if you have a system that's over 150 drives, you can purchase the enterprise.
106; ;00:12:19,730 --> 00:12:23,592; ;It's considered enterprise capacity, so there's no cost beyond that.
107; ;00:12:23,592 --> 00:12:27,510; ;Remember, the SC7020 can go up to 500 drives.
108; ;00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:34,676; ;So if you've got a larger system, you don't have to worry about paying that license over 150 drives.
109; ;00:12:34,676 --> 00:12:40,024; ;Now incorporated in the per drive licensing is the Core software.
110; ;00:12:40,024 --> 00:12:46,232; ;And you see all of the features the software packages or the software options contain within that Core here.
111; ;00:12:46,232 --> 00:12:52,387; ;Now the other way of doing licensing in the 7020 is per array.
112; ;00:12:54,820 --> 00:13:09,149; ;If I purchase a license by array, that's a one time purchase and that covers any number of drives that I have in that array, okay, whether it be anywhere from 30 or 20 at the low end up to 500.
113; ;00:13:09,149 --> 00:13:16,282; ;But it's a one-time purchase of the array no matter how many drives that are in that array.
114; ;00:13:16,282 --> 00:13:33,731; ;From a software perspective, I can purchase bundles, I have a Storage Optimization bundle which is where Data Progression lives, Storage Protection bundle, and then the Total feature which also incorporates those two packages as well as chargeback and encryption.
115; ;00:13:33,731 --> 00:13:40,117; ;I can purchase the bundles or I can purchase any of these software modules a-la-carte.
116; ;00:13:40,117 --> 00:13:42,543; ;So I have that flexibility as well.
117; ;00:13:42,543 --> 00:13:52,962; ;Both from a hardware and software side, this is a much simpler approach to licensing and it will reduce overall TCO because of it.
1; ;00:00:01,272 --> 00:00:09,921; ;We'll finish our discussion of the different models in the SC Series family by talking about the SC9000 solution.
2; ;00:00:11,169 --> 00:00:19,024; ;The SC9000 is really designed for mid-market customers who have heavier workloads.
3; ;00:00:20,123 --> 00:00:24,021; ;That's who we're targeting with the SC9000.
4; ;00:00:24,021 --> 00:00:33,413; ;In the next couple of slides, we're going to kind of talk about why the 9000 is such a great fit in those types of environments.
5; ;00:00:33,413 --> 00:00:40,748; ;Just a couple highlights you'll see on here, the SC9000 has 12 gig SAS on the backend.
6; ;00:00:40,748 --> 00:00:46,046; ;We'll talk more about that, that's where the SC400 and SC420 enclosures come in.
7; ;00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:55,299; ;It's got a 4 gig write cache card and incorporates a little bit more simplified licensing model than we saw on the SC8000.
8; ;00:00:55,290 --> 00:00:59,760; ;The minimum SCOS version is 6.7.
9; ;00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:08,957; ;So 6.7 was released, I want to say, spring of 2015, right in that timeframe.
10; ;00:01:08,957 --> 00:01:12,419; ;The SC9000 is really the SC Series leader.
11; ;00:01:12,419 --> 00:01:19,289; ;And in this slide we're going to kind of talk about what we mean by that as far as being the SC Series leader.
12; ;00:01:19,289 --> 00:01:27,304; ;It has significant performance increases especially over the SC8000.
13; ;00:01:27,304 --> 00:01:33,622; ;The first release is 6.7, so that was initially when the SC9000 was released.
14; ;00:01:33,622 --> 00:01:36,567; ;As we said, we're now up to 7.1.
15; ;00:01:36,567 --> 00:01:39,277; ;So 6.7 was when the release was.
16; ;00:01:39,277 --> 00:01:43,088; ;Some of the performance increases are all really detailed here.
17; ;00:01:43,088 --> 00:01:53,736; ;You've got 12 gig SAS back-end, the 8000, as you recall, 6 gig SAS back-end, eight-core processors, these are 3.2 gigahertz processors.
18; ;00:01:53,736 --> 00:01:59,149; ;If you might recall the SC8000, six-core 2.8 gigahertz processors.
19; ;00:01:59,149 --> 00:02:02,388; ;It's got four times more memory than the SC8000.
20; ;00:02:02,388 --> 00:02:08,580; ;These are all sort of adding up to these performance increases that we're going to see here.
21; ;00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:21,725; ;So it ends up being roughly 40% more IOPS, about a 110% improvement in throughput, up to 93% capacity savings, and zero workload downtime.
22; ;00:02:21,725 --> 00:02:24,835; ;A lot of that is revolving around the software.
23; ;00:02:24,835 --> 00:02:38,461; ;So what we've seen in our internal testing and it says there in the notes of the slide - you'll see some specifics behind the details - but 360,000+ IOPS is what we've seen from the SC9000.
24; ;00:02:38,461 --> 00:02:53,113; ;It is a strong performer, much faster, really massive scalability, both up and out, more consistently improving performance.
25; ;00:02:53,113 --> 00:03:12,416; ;Fail-safe availability, more reliability, more security for a non-stop business, and overall with less cost because the automated software which as we've said is all part of the SCOS family, but that automated efficiency helps as far as the return on investment.
26; ;00:03:13,521 --> 00:03:23,107; ;Let's look at how the SC9000 optimizes the core of business and we're going to kind of start with always available storage.
27; ;00:03:23,107 --> 00:03:27,819; ;Seamless disaster recovery, transparent auto-failover.
28; ;00:03:27,819 --> 00:03:39,352; ;That's really talking about Live Volume and some of the enhancements around Live Volume with the release of SCOS 6.7 along with the SC9000.
29; ;00:03:39,352 --> 00:03:50,673; ;The dollars per performance leader, what that really speaks to is some new compression algorithms that came out as the result of 6.7.
30; ;00:03:50,673 --> 00:04:04,377; ;So that intelligent compression really shows itself with the AFAs - or all flash arrays-, that's where we really can see an improvement in terms of dollars and ROI.
31; ;00:04:04,377 --> 00:04:20,932; ;And then finally, keeping in mind the deduplication along with compression was released with SCOS 7.0, so we had some enhancements in 6.7, added enhancements to those initial releases in 7.0.
32; ;00:04:20,932 --> 00:04:24,657; ;All this can transfer into a lower total cost of ownership.
33; ;00:04:24,657 --> 00:04:35,882; ;A lot of that again we mentioned this briefly before, but simplified software licensing, especially as we compare it to the SC8000, a much simpler model.
34; ;00:04:35,882 --> 00:04:39,853; ;And then finally, completely revamped platform performance.
35; ;00:04:39,853 --> 00:04:45,733; ;We talked a little bit about this in the previous slide, more cache, faster processor, there's more memory.
36; ;00:04:46,764 --> 00:05:04,106; ;And a lot of this is based on the fact that remember we're using Dell's 13G R730 server, which is the most advanced server in the Dell Server family, those serve as the controllers for the SC9000.
37; ;00:05:04,106 --> 00:05:16,661; ;This slide is designed to show how the SC9000 is really tied-in with the rest of the SC Series family to provide an outstanding solution no matter what the customer is looking for.
38; ;00:05:16,661 --> 00:05:23,780; ;We kind of start on the bottom of the screen with the basic tenets of the SCOS platform.
39; ;00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:36,683; ;Things such as Data Progression, flash optimization, our single-pane management, shared firmware across all the lines, and multiple expansion options.
40; ;00:05:36,683 --> 00:05:46,384; ;And again, allowing you to go from a smaller system, SCv series, up to our largest solution which is the SC9000.
41; ;00:05:46,384 --> 00:05:58,528; ;So as we kind of build out this slide, a couple of things that I want to call your attention to: up on the far left there, the first pane is how we would work with big data with an SC9000.
42; ;00:06:00,839 --> 00:06:04,993; ;Really what a big data customer is looking for is massive scalability.
43; ;00:06:04,993 --> 00:06:08,382; ;And he gets that with potentially multiple SC9000s.
44; ;00:06:08,382 --> 00:06:14,770; ;We're showing the multiple SC9000s in a federated system environment.
45; ;00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:32,360; ;These multiple systems can work together and they use features such as Live Volume, they use features like Live Migrate in the federated system to provide the big data customer with really massive scalability with an SC9000.
46; ;00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:40,946; ;So as we look up into the far right, we can see how we use replication and we can go from the SC9000 to an SC4020.
47; ;00:06:40,946 --> 00:06:50,031; ;You might recall when we talked about the SC4020 earlier we said that it was ideal for a remote or branch office, right?
48; ;00:06:50,031 --> 00:06:57,224; ;Now great for distributed environments, you can also use block and file with connecting an FS8600.
49; ;00:06:57,224 --> 00:07:09,963; ;You can use an FS8600 to connect to an SC9000, to connect to an SC4020 to provide that file-level storage as well.
50; ;00:07:09,963 --> 00:07:18,385; ;That's where replication is a great tool to use here between an SC9000 and an SC4020.
51; ;00:07:18,385 --> 00:07:27,360; ;Down in the lower left, we will see how the SC9000 working with auto-failover is great in a cloud environment.
52; ;00:07:29,296 --> 00:07:34,669; ;With the updates to Live Volume as we mentioned, it gets us to those 5/9's of availability.
53; ;00:07:34,669 --> 00:07:46,820; ;One other thing that's a feature with Live Volume as of 6.7 and going forward is the ability to do an asynchronous replication between one system and another.
54; ;00:07:46,820 --> 00:08:01,262; ;So what we're showing here with Live Volume between SC9000 and SC4020, we can have true disaster recovery, that SC4020 can be asynchronously replicated from the SC9000.
55; ;00:08:03,086 --> 00:08:10,443; ;A true disaster recovery could be well, you know, hundreds of miles away from the SC9000.
56; ;00:08:10,443 --> 00:08:19,178; ;So a lot of functionality here that really came about because of the improvements in Live Volume.
57; ;00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:33,902; ;And then finally in kind of the lower right there of the screen, we're showing SC7020 and then how you can do replication between an SC9000 and an SC7020.
58; ;00:08:33,902 --> 00:08:42,199; ;The other thing we want to kind of point out here is a lot of the automated cost savings around deduplication and compression.
59; ;00:08:42,199 --> 00:08:51,629; ;Deduplication, remember, came out as of version 7.0 and there were some great enhancements to compression starting with SCOS 6.7.
60; ;00:08:51,629 --> 00:08:54,016; ;It just points out the word thin here.
61; ;00:08:54,016 --> 00:09:00,681; ;Now the reason it does that is because really, everything that we do in the SC Series is around thin.
62; ;00:09:00,681 --> 00:09:10,563; ;So for example, thin provisioning on new volumes that we create on the SC Series, thin snapshots, any snapshots that we take is going to be thin.
63; ;00:09:10,563 --> 00:09:15,209; ;And then replication of those snapshots is thin because the snapshot is thin.
64; ;00:09:15,209 --> 00:09:18,545; ;So it's thin replication as well.
65; ;00:09:18,545 --> 00:09:21,432; ;There's a lot of functionality built-in.
66; ;00:09:21,432 --> 00:09:35,145; ;And because of some of these automated cost savings, we have the lowest flash cost per gigabyte in the industry, so a lot of great functionality that starts and works around the SC9000.
67; ;00:09:37,532 --> 00:09:41,724; ;Let's take a little more technical deep dive into the SC9000.
68; ;00:09:41,724 --> 00:09:47,902; ;We'll start by looking at the front and back view of the solution.
69; ;00:09:47,902 --> 00:09:49,813; ;Now these are the controllers themselves.
70; ;00:09:49,813 --> 00:10:02,399; ;So remember that the SC9000 like the SC8000 has dual controllers in all the storages, all the drives are in an enclosure or multiple enclosures.
71; ;00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:11,333; ;This shows the front, the SC9000 controller is based on Dell's 13th generation of servers the R730.
72; ;00:10:11,333 --> 00:10:20,135; ;And at the time of this recording, it was the most technologically advanced server in the Dell Server line.
73; ;00:10:20,135 --> 00:10:24,689; ;It's an R730 which is a 2U server.
74; ;00:10:24,689 --> 00:10:29,419; ;So you see the front of the SC9000 controller here.
75; ;00:10:29,419 --> 00:10:32,511; ;Let's take a look at the back of the controller itself.
76; ;00:10:32,511 --> 00:10:35,862; ;There are seven PCIe slots.
77; ;00:10:35,862 --> 00:10:39,484; ;So three of them are low profile, slots 1, 2, and 3.
78; ;00:10:39,484 --> 00:10:45,969; ;And four of them are full-height card slots, you kind of see how they're numbered here 4, 5, 6, and 7.
79; ;00:10:45,969 --> 00:10:51,052; ;You'll notice there's a card already in slot 7 - that's the write cache card.
80; ;00:10:51,052 --> 00:10:53,654; ;It's 4 gig Fibre Channel card.
81; ;00:10:53,654 --> 00:11:01,192; ;This is new on the SC9000, and it's the only PCIe slot that comes populated.
82; ;00:11:01,192 --> 00:11:12,684; ;When a customer receives a new SC9000, the cards will come separate and the installer will be installing those cards in whatever slots are appropriate.
83; ;00:11:12,684 --> 00:11:17,520; ;So there is the specific cache card there in slot 7, the 4 gig card.
84; ;00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:20,286; ;It has redundant, hot-swappable power supplies.
85; ;00:11:20,286 --> 00:11:26,738; ;And again, they're designed to keep the controller up in case of a power supply fail.
86; ;00:11:26,738 --> 00:11:31,364; ;This slide contains the technical specifications for the SC9000 controller.
87; ;00:11:31,364 --> 00:11:37,909; ;Again, I'm not going to go into these certainly by any means line by line, you can certainly use this for reference if you need to.
88; ;00:11:37,909 --> 00:11:48,085; ;Just one kind of call out there in the red box, the min/max drive, so the minimum number of drives in an SC9000 is 6, the maximum is 1,024 per array.
89; ;00:11:48,085 --> 00:11:50,794; ;It says more in federated systems.
90; ;00:11:50,794 --> 00:11:54,201; ;We touched a little bit on this previously.
91; ;00:11:55,270 --> 00:12:08,792; ;In a federated environment, you have transparent non-disruptive volume movement using Live Volume and Live Migrate to move volumes across between systems.
92; ;00:12:08,792 --> 00:12:13,950; ;You have the ability to have a cluster of up to eight SC9000 arrays.
93; ;00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:22,576; ;So in theory, you could have up to 24 petabytes of raw capacity and over 8 terabytes of system cache.
94; ;00:12:22,576 --> 00:12:32,073; ;That would be the advantage of going with a federated system if it was indeed truly a larger solution that we were looking at.
95; ;00:12:33,322 --> 00:12:40,349; ;Let's take a look at the enclosures that you can cable up to the controllers on an SC9000 system.
96; ;00:12:40,349 --> 00:12:45,476; ;Those are the SC400 and SC420 enclosures.
97; ;00:12:45,476 --> 00:12:47,769; ;Let's take a little deeper dive into each of those.
98; ;00:12:47,769 --> 00:12:50,638; ;We'll start with the SC420.
99; ;00:12:50,638 --> 00:12:57,091; ;And you can see we're looking at the front of the 420 here, you'll notice that it's 2U.
100; ;00:12:57,091 --> 00:13:06,284; ;And you'll also notice that there are 24, and that's the maximum number or drives in an individual enclosure, 24 2.5-inch drive slots.
101; ;00:13:06,284 --> 00:13:08,023; ;That's the SC420.
102; ;00:13:08,023 --> 00:13:11,263; ;These are the 12 gig SAS enclosures.
103; ;00:13:11,263 --> 00:13:17,994; ;As we know, they work with the SC9000 and you might recall, they also work with the SC7020.
104; ;00:13:17,994 --> 00:13:24,452; ;Those are the two 12 gig SAS solutions that support the SC400 and SC420.
105; ;00:13:24,452 --> 00:13:27,087; ;That's the 9000 and the 7020.
106; ;00:13:27,087 --> 00:13:29,506; ;You see what the 420 looks like.
107; ;00:13:29,506 --> 00:13:31,628; ;That's 2.5-inch drive slots.
108; ;00:13:31,628 --> 00:13:37,344; ;The SC400 has up to 12 3.5-inch drive slots.
109; ;00:13:37,344 --> 00:13:46,124; ;Again 2U, now if you look at the back of the SC400 or 420, they're exactly the same.
110; ;00:13:46,124 --> 00:13:49,816; ;They have dual enclosure management modules on the back.
111; ;00:13:49,816 --> 00:13:55,049; ;There's dual hot-swap power supply units.
112; ;00:13:55,049 --> 00:14:05,580; ;As we've talked about in every other component in the SC Series family, if I lose one of the power supplies, the enclosure will stay running.
113; ;00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:14,532; ;These are supported, these are the 12 gig SAS enclosures that are supported by 9000 and 7020.
114; ;00:14:14,532 --> 00:14:20,077; ;This slide, we provide a comparison between the SC400 and the SC420.
115; ;00:14:20,077 --> 00:14:30,483; ;First of all, you'll notice that, as we mentioned earlier, they are supported on both the SC9000 and SC7020 solutions, and they're both 12 gig SAS.
116; ;00:14:30,483 --> 00:14:48,709; ;Maximum number of drives, as you take a look at the drives supported again, even though they're quite similar, the only exception being the SC400, which as we talked about is 3.5-inch drives, they support 7K spinning disks as well as different flavors of SSD.
117; ;00:14:48,709 --> 00:14:59,532; ;The SC420, which is the 2.5-inch drive, they support both 15K and 10K spinning disks along with different flavors of SSDs.
118; ;00:14:59,532 --> 00:15:06,727; ;Both of them support the SEDs which is short for self-encrypting drives.
119; ;00:15:06,727 --> 00:15:15,937; ;Self-encrypting drives are supported in both SC400 and SC420, on both hard disks, the spinning media, and SSDs.
120; ;00:15:15,937 --> 00:15:20,215; ;And of course, they support both write-intensive as well as read-intensive SSDs.
121; ;00:15:21,557 --> 00:15:39,287; ;Deployment of the SC9000 is done by trained members of the Dell Enterprise Deployment team, referred to as the EDT team, or it can be done by certified channel partners who have been trained specifically for installation of Dell SC storage arrays.
122; ;00:15:39,287 --> 00:15:47,405; ;Really some of the advantages of doing deployments this way, it really frees up the customer's IT staff.
123; ;00:15:47,405 --> 00:16:01,843; ;It eliminates error in installation, so Dell installers don't have to come back out later, and it really minimizes disruption to the business when we have Dell or certified partners do the installation of the SC9000.
124; ;00:16:01,843 --> 00:16:07,953; ;This is true for all of the other SC Series with the exception of the SCv2000.
125; ;00:16:07,953 --> 00:16:10,373; ;Remember, those are customer installable.
126; ;00:16:10,373 --> 00:16:18,915; ;Everything else in the Dell family, in the SC Series family, excuse me, are installed by certified installers.
127; ;00:16:18,915 --> 00:16:22,594; ;Let's talk about licensing on the SC9000.
128; ;00:16:22,594 --> 00:16:29,441; ;One of the things that you'll notice as you look here is it looks very similar to the SC7020.
129; ;00:16:29,441 --> 00:16:31,742; ;Conceptually, it's really the same thing.
130; ;00:16:31,742 --> 00:16:36,160; ;The difference is that enterprise cap or the enterprise capacity license.
131; ;00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,318; ;So that's 200.
132; ;00:16:37,318 --> 00:16:41,491; ;If you recall, it was 150 on the SC7020.
133; ;00:16:41,491 --> 00:16:44,441; ;There are two different ways to license it.
134; ;00:16:44,441 --> 00:16:55,983; ;You can license it per drive, the customer purchases exactly the number of licenses that they need or the customer can license per array.
135; ;00:16:55,983 --> 00:16:59,230; ;Now when they license per array, they can purchase the bundles.
136; ;00:16:59,230 --> 00:17:04,558; ;You'll notice when you license it per drive, you have the core base license here.
137; ;00:17:04,558 --> 00:17:12,690; ;And of course, they can purchase any one of these bundles if they do the licensing on a per drive basis as well.
138; ;00:17:12,690 --> 00:17:17,141; ;On a per array basis, there's a one-time purchase that covers any number of drives.
139; ;00:17:17,141 --> 00:17:24,345; ;It's really truly licensing the array and not so concerned about individual drives.
140; ;00:17:24,345 --> 00:17:34,988; ;So you have the Storage Optimization bundle, the Storage Protection bundle, and then the total package, which would include those two bundles plus Chargeback and Encryption.
141; ;00:17:34,988 --> 00:17:43,191; ;And the other neat thing about the SC9000, similar to the SC7020, is you can choose just the software features that you need.
142; ;00:17:43,191 --> 00:17:50,710; ;You can pick and choose which ones that, you know, the customer needs in their particular environment.
143; ;00:17:52,021 --> 00:18:01,008; ;This slide provides us an SC Series product comparison between the four different types of SC Series solutions.
144; ;00:18:01,008 --> 00:18:06,562; ;I'm not going to spend a whole bunch of time drilling down into all the figures.
145; ;00:18:06,562 --> 00:18:12,077; ;You can kind of see as you go left to right, the 9000 is sort of the higher-end.
146; ;00:18:12,077 --> 00:18:15,804; ;You see eight-core, little faster processor.
147; ;00:18:17,132 --> 00:18:21,080; ;It does have a little more system memory than the SC7020.
148; ;00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:25,631; ;So a lot of it is very similar.
149; ;00:18:25,631 --> 00:18:32,450; ;You'll notice the drive expansion, there's more drive capability in the SC9000 than the SC7020.
150; ;00:18:32,450 --> 00:18:43,733; ;And certainly, as you go down to the entry-level, the SCv2000 series, you see less storage, less system memory, less of a CPU.
151; ;00:18:43,733 --> 00:19:01,076; ;All those things, going left to right, you can look at the... take a look at this chart, you know, if a customer asks about differences between each or if you have any questions, this is a great way to compare one solution to the other in the SC Series.
152; ;00:19:01,076 --> 00:19:05,593; ;It's time for our last handful of review questions here.
153; ;00:19:05,593 --> 00:19:12,996; ;We'll start with what SC Series solution holds up to 30 2.5-inch drives in a 3U chassis?
154; ;00:19:12,996 --> 00:19:14,399; ;Remember that from a little bit ago?
155; ;00:19:14,399 --> 00:19:16,951; ;Yep, SC7020.
156; ;00:19:18,188 --> 00:19:25,083; ;Next, what SC Series solutions support SC400 and 420 drive enclosures for storage expansion?
157; ;00:19:25,083 --> 00:19:28,899; ;We just talked about that quite a bit a few slides ago.
158; ;00:19:28,899 --> 00:19:32,722; ;SC7020 and SC9000, good.
159; ;00:19:33,884 --> 00:19:37,748; ;And then finally, what SC Series solution has the most memory?
160; ;00:19:38,893 --> 00:19:42,007; ;And that's the SC9000, good, good.
1; ;00:00:01,698 --> 00:00:05,981; ;Let's start our look into the SC Series flash solutions.
2; ;00:00:05,981 --> 00:00:11,616; ;We'll look at different types of solid-state disks that are available today.
3; ;00:00:11,616 --> 00:00:14,738; ;We'll start with a discussion question.
4; ;00:00:14,738 --> 00:00:20,247; ;Can you name the two types of SSDs used in an SC Series array?
5; ;00:00:20,247 --> 00:00:21,263; ;You know what those two are?
6; ;00:00:21,263 --> 00:00:24,933; ;We're going to talk about these in a lot more detail here coming up.
7; ;00:00:24,933 --> 00:00:25,936; ;Yep.
8; ;00:00:25,936 --> 00:00:31,041; ;WI for write-intensive and RI for read-intensive.
9; ;00:00:31,041 --> 00:00:41,441; ;Our focus on the next several slides is going to be differentiating between those two types of SSD drives that are available in the SC Series.
10; ;00:00:41,441 --> 00:00:49,644; ;As we discussed the SSD drives available in the SC Series, we'll start with the read-intensive SSDs first.
11; ;00:00:49,644 --> 00:00:59,125; ;The read-intensive SSDs are the most recent SSDs that have been added to the SC Series portfolio.
12; ;00:00:59,125 --> 00:01:03,699; ;We really have two types as we just saw on the last slide, write-intensive and read-intensive.
13; ;00:01:03,699 --> 00:01:07,808; ;We refer to it as RI often.
14; ;00:01:07,808 --> 00:01:17,967; ;The advantage of the RI SSDs is they offer the lowest-cost and the highest-density enterprise flash drives.
15; ;00:01:17,967 --> 00:01:30,497; ;And really, that's how they achieve such a low dollars per gigabyte is with that increased density and reducing the right endurance to one write drive per day.
16; ;00:01:30,497 --> 00:01:33,331; ;And we're going to talk a little bit more about that on the next slide.
17; ;00:01:33,331 --> 00:01:40,694; ;It's less than half the dollars per gigabytes of write-intensive drives, so definitely at a great price point.
18; ;00:01:40,694 --> 00:01:44,131; ;Up to nine times more dense than write-intensive drives.
19; ;00:01:44,131 --> 00:01:54,653; ;And they're definitely superior to traditional spinning disks, referred to as HDDs, in both read and write performance for almost the same cost.
20; ;00:01:54,653 --> 00:02:04,245; ;As the price of SSDs keep coming down, we're seeing more and more customers turn to an SSD solution.
21; ;00:02:04,245 --> 00:02:16,220; ;And with the introduction of these read-intensive SSDs, support for all flash arrays becomes much more common.
22; ;00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:25,889; ;In fact, in the SC Series array, all of the solutions support an all-flash array, including the Series 40.
23; ;00:02:25,889 --> 00:02:26,899; ;So keep that in mind.
24; ;00:02:26,899 --> 00:02:34,265; ;The Series 40s which are our older hardware, those also support an all-flash array.
25; ;00:02:34,265 --> 00:02:39,296; ;You can't purchase the Series 40s any longer, they've been discontinued for sale.
26; ;00:02:39,296 --> 00:02:46,087; ;However, customers can still work with an all-flash array in the Series 40.
27; ;00:02:46,087 --> 00:02:53,987; ;As we said, there are two different types of SSDs that are in the SC Series, write-intensive and read-intensive.
28; ;00:02:53,987 --> 00:02:59,450; ;This chart gives you a little bit of a distinction really between the two.
29; ;00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:08,527; ;From a workload perspective, we're talking about heavy write applications for write-intensive SSDs, makes sense, hence the name.
30; ;00:03:08,527 --> 00:03:18,119; ;Read-intensive SSDs mainly read application, they can be a flash-optimized scenario where there's 90% read, 10% write mix.
31; ;00:03:18,119 --> 00:03:33,441; ;So ideally, you don't want to use the read-intensive drives for heavy write applications because they can literally wear out if they're used too often for writes.
32; ;00:03:33,441 --> 00:03:43,455; ;From a drive terminology perspective, single-level cell and multi-level cell, SLC and MLC, make our write-intensive drives.
33; ;00:03:43,455 --> 00:03:57,632; ;The MLCs can also be read-intensive drives and TLC, triple-level cells, that is what you're seeing more and more of in the read-intensive area because those become less expensive, okay?
34; ;00:03:57,632 --> 00:04:00,139; ;So that's drive vendor terminology.
35; ;00:04:00,139 --> 00:04:02,413; ;What does the drive technology mean?
36; ;00:04:02,413 --> 00:04:05,293; ;What does SLC, MLC, and TLC mean?
37; ;00:04:05,293 --> 00:04:09,738; ;In drive technology, you see those specifics.
38; ;00:04:09,738 --> 00:04:14,162; ;And then you see the write endurance and the difference between the two.
39; ;00:04:14,162 --> 00:04:20,464; ;The write endurance is 10 drive writes per day as opposed to 1 drive write per day.
40; ;00:04:20,464 --> 00:04:29,938; ;That's why we mean you want to make sure that you're not using RI SSDs for heavy write applications.
41; ;00:04:29,938 --> 00:04:32,638; ;Both have great read performance.
42; ;00:04:32,638 --> 00:04:40,101; ;And notice the cost, typically, about two times more expensive for the WI SSDs.
43; ;00:04:40,101 --> 00:04:46,481; ;And as we see, nearly the same cost as spinning disks for those read-intensive SSDs.
44; ;00:04:46,481 --> 00:04:54,448; ;A couple other differences between the two, write-intensive, as we said, definitely has the highest endurance especially for write applications.
45; ;00:04:54,448 --> 00:05:00,421; ;But it also has lower capacity and definitely a higher cost of any of the SSDs.
46; ;00:05:00,421 --> 00:05:05,393; ;It can be used for any application, so it's a great fit for all of our applications.
47; ;00:05:05,393 --> 00:05:11,450; ;If you've used SSDs over the years, this is really the traditional SSD.
48; ;00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:16,649; ;It's been available in the SC Series for years.
49; ;00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:19,195; ;It certainly works best for write operations.
50; ;00:05:19,195 --> 00:05:29,543; ;What you see in multi-level cells, we mentioned the MLCs, they're most commonly used for write-intensive today.
51; ;00:05:29,543 --> 00:05:36,180; ;Originally, the single-level cells or SLCs were the only ones used for write-intensive.
52; ;00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:39,835; ;Today, you see much more MLCs used for that.
53; ;00:05:39,835 --> 00:05:49,251; ;Now from a read-intensive standpoint, read-intensive drives were released actually back with SCOS version 6.4.
54; ;00:05:49,251 --> 00:05:53,733; ;That came out back in late 2013.
55; ;00:05:53,733 --> 00:06:01,160; ;Definitely has higher capacity but lower endurance especially if you're using it for heavy writes.
56; ;00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:05,635; ;It works best in an environment that is mostly read.
57; ;00:06:05,635 --> 00:06:25,625; ;One of the things that show here, the storage industry often refers to SSD drives as SLC, MLC, and now the TLC, the triple-level cell, which is the most common read-intensive SSDs that we sell.
58; ;00:06:25,625 --> 00:06:29,204; ;These technologies are continuously changing.
59; ;00:06:29,204 --> 00:06:37,973; ;In the SC Series, we no longer refer to those technologies, because it gets difficult to keep up with those.
60; ;00:06:37,973 --> 00:06:41,364; ;That's why we go to write-intensive and read-intensive.
61; ;00:06:41,364 --> 00:06:50,122; ;So no matter what the underlying technology is, these terms will accurately reflect the type of drive that the customer is purchasing.
62; ;00:06:50,122 --> 00:06:56,063; ;Let's take a look at the drives that are available in the SC Series portfolio.
63; ;00:06:56,063 --> 00:07:02,798; ;These are the drive sizes available when this recording was released.
64; ;00:07:02,798 --> 00:07:11,753; ;So you're looking at this is the availability of these drives in the September-October 2016 time frame.
65; ;00:07:11,753 --> 00:07:19,828; ;Under the solid-state disks, the SSDs, these are the WI or write-intensive sizes.
66; ;00:07:19,828 --> 00:07:24,657; ;And the read-intensive sizes are in this column here.
67; ;00:07:24,657 --> 00:07:37,648; ;Notice that the 7.68 terabyte drive or the 8 terabyte drive, another way to look at it, right, it's going to be available in the first quarter of 2017, so kind of look for that.
68; ;00:07:37,648 --> 00:07:48,234; ;A couple things just to note in here, one is that the drive sizes can change fairly quickly.
69; ;00:07:48,234 --> 00:07:54,439; ;Our suppliers can end-of-life a certain drive size and come up with a new one.
70; ;00:07:54,439 --> 00:08:04,295; ;So you always want to make sure before you actually sell the drives, the particular sizes available.
71; ;00:08:04,295 --> 00:08:08,133; ;Here you see the spinning disks that are available.
72; ;00:08:08,133 --> 00:08:12,678; ;As of this recording, these were the sizes that were there.
73; ;00:08:12,678 --> 00:08:17,677; ;You always want to make sure to check the price sheet because this is just the sizes available.
74; ;00:08:17,677 --> 00:08:20,404; ;It doesn't talk about form factor.
75; ;00:08:20,404 --> 00:08:29,181; ;So you'll have to be aware of, you'll have to check what are 2.5-inch drives and what are 3.5-inch drives.
76; ;00:08:30,752 --> 00:08:45,140; ;One thing we're seeing more and more of with new customers is we're seeing more and more of them going to the read-intensive SSDs just because of the reduced price point as well as the increased capacity.
77; ;00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:54,300; ;But the advantage, of course, of the SC Series as it is future ready, so let's kind of talk about what we mean by future ready.
78; ;00:08:54,300 --> 00:09:03,084; ;A customer can get into a low-cost entry-level system by going to write-intensive SSDs.
79; ;00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:06,273; ;So this can be a single-tier all-flash array.
80; ;00:09:06,273 --> 00:09:16,476; ;It's got that RAID tiering efficiency built in, where we write into RAID 10 and move into RAID 5, those blocks will go into RAID 5.
81; ;00:09:16,476 --> 00:09:29,602; ;So we're talking about just the way that the software works that single-tiering is going to provide some great advantages for customers, that's where the SC4020 is a great fit.
82; ;00:09:29,602 --> 00:09:33,858; ;That's because you get an all-flash array solution at an entry level price.
83; ;00:09:33,858 --> 00:09:42,319; ;If the customer needs to add a bit more performance, he can add relatively small amount of write-intensive drives.
84; ;00:09:42,319 --> 00:09:45,026; ;They're certainly going to increase performance.
85; ;00:09:45,026 --> 00:09:52,047; ;And if that's needed, you can add however many write-intensive drives that you need.
86; ;00:09:52,047 --> 00:09:57,423; ;As the business continues to grow, we can add HDD tier.
87; ;00:09:57,423 --> 00:10:00,132; ;We can add "cheap and deep" spinning disks.
88; ;00:10:00,132 --> 00:10:09,049; ;As the business continues to grow, it needs to save maybe more and more data.
89; ;00:10:09,049 --> 00:10:14,271; ;These drives can be added on the fly, they're relatively inexpensive.
90; ;00:10:14,271 --> 00:10:20,250; ;More expansion might require more cheap and deep storage.
91; ;00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:28,267; ;What they'll often find is dollars per gigabyte can actually decrease at scale as we keep growing.
92; ;00:10:28,267 --> 00:10:32,708; ;So you'll notice here we're adding more read-intensive SSDs.
93; ;00:10:32,708 --> 00:10:45,747; ;In a multi-tier array, most expansion occurs in the lower tiers, the write-intensive SSDs and definitely in the 7.2K spinning disk as well.
94; ;00:10:45,747 --> 00:10:49,545; ;This is where most of your expansion is going to occur over time.
95; ;00:10:50,682 --> 00:11:02,910; ;To put some teeth behind the future-ready storage, the SC Series provides an enterprise-class flash reliability guarantee.
96; ;00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:09,520; ;That guarantee says that we provide a lifetime warranty on flash drives.
97; ;00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:13,233; ;Dell will replace any SSDs that wear out.
98; ;00:11:13,233 --> 00:11:21,513; ;Full coverage while the array is under a support agreement, regardless of wear or maximum life rating.
99; ;00:11:21,513 --> 00:11:37,935; ;As long as the customer maintains a current service plan, so that's a ProSupport plan or a plan with Copilot, Dell will replace any drives that wear out, so this is a huge advantage.
100; ;00:11:37,935 --> 00:11:49,157; ;Because of the way that the SC Series software works, the architectural advantages allow us to make this guarantee with confidence.
101; ;00:11:49,157 --> 00:11:53,647; ;Let's look at a couple of review questions then that are on this module.
102; ;00:11:53,647 --> 00:11:58,045; ;What type of SSD disk has the largest drive size?
103; ;00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:01,990; ;Remember that? You just looked at that chart.
104; ;00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:03,607; ;Read-intensive, right?
105; ;00:12:03,607 --> 00:12:06,624; ;Yep, read-intensive has the largest drive size.
106; ;00:12:06,624 --> 00:12:13,968; ;What type of disk should be added to an all read-intensive SSD system when performance needs increase?
107; ;00:12:15,393 --> 00:12:16,669; ;Yep, you probably got that.
108; ;00:12:16,669 --> 00:12:18,906; ;Write-intensive, right?
109; ;00:12:18,906 --> 00:12:26,249; ;Definitely a lot faster and a lot longer lasting if I'm going to have heavy write applications.
110; ;00:12:26,249 --> 00:12:32,286; ;And then true or false, an all-flash array, AFA, is not supported on an SCv2000.
111; ;00:12:33,695 --> 00:12:36,542; ;And that is false, right?
112; ;00:12:36,542 --> 00:12:45,127; ;So remember, you can have an all-flash array on any one of the SC Series systems including the old Series 40.
1; ;00:00:01,631 --> 00:00:03,638; ;Here's a discussion question for us.
2; ;00:00:03,638 --> 00:00:07,473; ;Name the two types of Data Progression used in SC Series array?
3; ;00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:11,445; ;You probably know that one already.
4; ;00:00:11,445 --> 00:00:17,194; ;We've got the traditional Data Progression and On-demand Data Progression.
5; ;00:00:17,194 --> 00:00:27,503; ;In the next few slides, we're just going to talk about the difference between the two and try to point out some of the things that do make them different.
6; ;00:00:27,503 --> 00:00:36,411; ;Let's look at Data Progression, and particularly looking at the differences between traditional Data Progression and On-demand Data Progression.
7; ;00:00:36,411 --> 00:00:40,767; ;We'll start with, we'll look at traditional Data Progression.
8; ;00:00:40,767 --> 00:00:55,917; ;What Data Progression does, it leverages costs and performance differences between types of drives, between storage tiers, allowing the maximum use of lower-cost, high-capacity SAS drives.
9; ;00:00:55,917 --> 00:01:10,613; ;Typically, they're going to be in tier 3 for stored data, while maintaining performance oriented drives, that's going to be in tier 1, SSDs typically, could be 15K drives for frequently accessed data.
10; ;00:01:10,613 --> 00:01:22,647; ;Data Progression takes advantage of this by automatically tracking block usage and migrating data between tiers based on Storage Profiles.
11; ;00:01:22,647 --> 00:01:25,240; ;And here are the Storage Profiles here.
12; ;00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:28,892; ;As we have said, the recommended profile, that's the default.
13; ;00:01:28,892 --> 00:01:31,703; ;This optimizes Data Progression across all tiers.
14; ;00:01:31,703 --> 00:01:35,837; ;So most of our customers will use that recommended Data Progression.
15; ;00:01:38,035 --> 00:01:50,302; ;The other options for system-defined Storage Profiles are you can pin a volume into tier 1, tier 2, or tier 3 by choosing high priority, medium priority, or low priority.
16; ;00:01:50,302 --> 00:01:59,177; ;Keep in mind though that if you say I want a particular volume to always be in tier 3, low priority.
17; ;00:01:59,177 --> 00:02:05,664; ;That means that it won't ever move out of tier 3 unless you change its Storage Profile.
18; ;00:02:05,664 --> 00:02:18,941; ;That volume will remain in tier 3 even as that volume starts getting used more and some pages are used more often where you might want to have it move up to faster storage, it won't.
19; ;00:02:18,941 --> 00:02:23,884; ;It will always remain in tier 3 and the same with tier 1 or tier 2.
20; ;00:02:23,884 --> 00:02:35,381; ;If you choose those Storage Profiles, that volume will always remain in that tier unless you change the Storage Profile for that volume.
21; ;00:02:35,381 --> 00:02:46,872; ;Here's the interface in the Dell Storage Manager client that shows the four different system-defined Storage Profiles from recommended to low priority.
22; ;00:02:46,872 --> 00:02:50,263; ;You can also create a Storage Profile.
23; ;00:02:50,263 --> 00:02:55,165; ;At any point, you can create a user-defined profile.
24; ;00:02:55,165 --> 00:02:57,644; ;This one shows tier 3 Storage Profile.
25; ;00:02:57,644 --> 00:03:05,485; ;But you can create any new profile you want from within the DSM interface from the screen.
26; ;00:03:05,485 --> 00:03:13,333; ;Keep in mind, traditional Data Progression runs on all SC Series systems that are not considered flash-optimized.
27; ;00:03:13,333 --> 00:03:16,694; ;So that's going to be a lot of systems.
28; ;00:03:16,694 --> 00:03:19,195; ;Most of our systems are not flash-optimized.
29; ;00:03:19,195 --> 00:03:22,490; ;The only exception to that is SCv2000.
30; ;00:03:22,490 --> 00:03:28,565; ;And SCv2000, their Storage Profiles, we'll talk about in the next slide.
31; ;00:03:28,565 --> 00:03:44,164; ;Remember that systems in the SCv2000 family are all single tier, so therefore we use the functionality referred to as RAID tiering to move data between RAID 10 and RAID 5 or RAID 6 in a single tier.
32; ;00:03:44,164 --> 00:03:49,729; ;It does not move data between tiers because, there's only one tier that's available.
33; ;00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:54,803; ;Because of that, there's no flexibility to add another Storage Profile.
34; ;00:03:54,803 --> 00:04:06,214; ;So the three Storage Profiles that you see here - Balanced, Maximum Efficiency, and Maximized Performance - those are the ones that system that customers will use.
35; ;00:04:06,214 --> 00:04:08,373; ;Let's take a quick look at each of those.
36; ;00:04:08,373 --> 00:04:15,592; ;With balanced, it balances efficiency and performance for any volume using that Storage Profile.
37; ;00:04:15,592 --> 00:04:20,419; ;This tells you what happens with the balanced profile.
38; ;00:04:21,912 --> 00:04:26,035; ;All writes go to tier 1, RAID 10.
39; ;00:04:26,035 --> 00:04:32,709; ;When snapshots are taken, they're taken in tier 1 because of course that's the only tier we've got.
40; ;00:04:32,709 --> 00:04:41,210; ;And then those volumes, those pages are moved to RAID 5 and 6, so this is going to improve the amount of space that we've got.
41; ;00:04:43,421 --> 00:04:46,447; ;The next type is Maximize Efficiency.
42; ;00:04:46,447 --> 00:04:56,537; ;Maximize Efficiency, it writes new data to RAID 5 or RAID 6 and it keeps that snapshot data in RAID 5 or RAID 6 as well.
43; ;00:04:56,537 --> 00:05:03,811; ;It's great for volumes with less important data or infrequently used data, that would be Maximize Efficiency.
44; ;00:05:03,811 --> 00:05:16,341; ;And then finally Maximize Performance, it's going to write new data into tier 10 and take snapshots -excuse me, into tier 1 - and it's going to take snapshots on RAID 10.
45; ;00:05:16,341 --> 00:05:18,823; ;This is going to increase performance.
46; ;00:05:18,823 --> 00:05:32,608; ;It's going to take up more space, but those volumes that have the Maximize Performance Storage Profile will have indeed better performance than either Balanced or Maximize Efficiency.
47; ;00:05:32,608 --> 00:05:37,541; ;We mentioned the flash-optimized solution a couple of times in this module.
48; ;00:05:37,541 --> 00:05:54,687; ;Remember, the flash-optimized solution is one where I've got write-intensive SSDs in tier 1, read-intensive SSDs in tier 2, and then 7.2K spinning drives in tier 3.
49; ;00:05:54,687 --> 00:06:01,134; ;If I've got that scenario, I have a flash-optimized solution.
50; ;00:06:01,134 --> 00:06:12,145; ;The flash-optimized solution came out, I want to say late 2014 with version 6.4.
51; ;00:06:12,145 --> 00:06:24,808; ;The key part of this is we wanted to make sure that we weren't filling up these write-intensive SSD drives because, of course, they're very expensive and they're not very big.
52; ;00:06:24,808 --> 00:06:30,858; ;The idea was that we wanted to make sure we weren't filling up tier 1.
53; ;00:06:30,858 --> 00:06:34,975; ;We wanted to keep that available space for new writes as much as possible.
54; ;00:06:34,975 --> 00:06:49,947; ;So that's the idea with On-demand Data Progression because with On-demand Data Progression what happens is as soon as a snapshot is taken, On-demand Data Progression will run.
55; ;00:06:49,947 --> 00:06:57,054; ;And when that On-demand Data Progression runs, it moves those pages from tier 1 down to tier 2.
56; ;00:06:57,054 --> 00:07:03,611; ;There's no waiting until like 7pm as the traditional Data Progression works.
57; ;00:07:03,611 --> 00:07:09,795; ;On-demand Data Progression works as soon as a snapshot is taken.
58; ;00:07:09,795 --> 00:07:15,769; ;On-demand Data Progression also produced a new type of snapshot.
59; ;00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:19,331; ;And this type of snapshot is called a space management snapshot.
60; ;00:07:19,331 --> 00:07:30,839; ;The idea is that if tier 1 is 95% full, the system itself, the software is going to take that space management snapshot.
61; ;00:07:30,839 --> 00:07:37,617; ;And the whole idea is that we want to make sure there's room on those write-intensive SSDs.
62; ;00:07:37,617 --> 00:07:51,422; ;It'll take that space management snapshot and then after the space management snapshot is taken, then of course the On-demand Data Progression runs and pages are moved from tier 1 to tier 2.
63; ;00:07:51,422 --> 00:07:55,889; ;So keep in mind those space management snapshots are not mountable.
64; ;00:07:55,889 --> 00:08:04,021; ;The only purpose of those is to free up the space in the tier 1 write-intensive SSD.
65; ;00:08:04,021 --> 00:08:10,859; ;With the introduction of On-demand Data Progression, it meant more Storage Profiles had to be made available.
66; ;00:08:10,859 --> 00:08:16,487; ;The original Storage Profiles were not going to work, the traditional Storage Profiles.
67; ;00:08:16,487 --> 00:08:25,866; ;So the engineers developed a series of profiles, five storage profiles that are used in a flash-optimized solution.
68; ;00:08:25,866 --> 00:08:29,597; ;So we're going to kind of review each of those now starting with the first one.
69; ;00:08:29,597 --> 00:08:31,641; ;Flash Only with Progression.
70; ;00:08:31,641 --> 00:08:39,456; ;The idea here is that new writes are going to come in to RAID 10 on those write-intensive SSDs.
71; ;00:08:39,456 --> 00:08:49,870; ;Once a snapshot is taken, then On-demand Data Progression runs and those pages will move down to tier 2 but they won't go any further down than that.
72; ;00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:53,075; ;So they'll always remain on flash.
73; ;00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:57,222; ;The next one is Flash-optimized with Progression.
74; ;00:08:57,222 --> 00:09:00,017; ;And this is actually the default.
75; ;00:09:00,017 --> 00:09:14,768; ;What happens here is I'm writing into tier 1, those write-intensive SSDs to RAID 10, when we do a snapshot then On-demand Data Progression moves into tier 2.
76; ;00:09:14,768 --> 00:09:22,913; ;And then at that point, the traditional nightly progression will run.
77; ;00:09:22,913 --> 00:09:28,459; ;And at that point, it will potentially move those pages down to tier 3.
78; ;00:09:28,459 --> 00:09:39,572; ;This provides the most efficient storage for enclosures containing both read-intensive and write-intensive as well as spinning media.
79; ;00:09:39,572 --> 00:09:42,723; ;The next one then is Low Priority.
80; ;00:09:42,723 --> 00:09:49,604; ;And with low priority, those volumes are going to be pinned to tier 3 and they're not going to move out of tier 3.
81; ;00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:57,960; ;They're going to be on the spinning disk, typically the 7.5K RPM drives.
82; ;00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:00,529; ;Next one is Low Priority with Progression.
83; ;00:10:00,529 --> 00:10:05,936; ;So here, you're starting that volume in tier 3.
84; ;00:10:05,936 --> 00:10:14,339; ;However, if performance warrants, it will migrate those pages up to tier 2.
85; ;00:10:14,339 --> 00:10:18,460; ;Notice that it won't go up to tier 1 with Low Priority with Progression.
86; ;00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:21,948; ;It will remain in tier 2.
87; ;00:10:21,948 --> 00:10:29,716; ;So we're still saving those tier 1 spaces for what we consider the highest priority volumes.
88; ;00:10:29,716 --> 00:10:33,042; ;And then the fifth one is write-intensive, or tier 1.
89; ;00:10:33,042 --> 00:10:37,617; ;Here writes go into tier 1, those write-intensive drives.
90; ;00:10:37,617 --> 00:10:45,020; ;Snapshots are taken, they're actually kept in tier 1 at RAID 10 as well, and data remains in tier 1.
91; ;00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:53,454; ;These are things that are useful for storing things like transaction logs and temporary database files that are continually being replenished.
92; ;00:10:53,454 --> 00:10:58,558; ;We want the performance, we don't necessarily need the snapshots.
93; ;00:10:58,558 --> 00:11:03,955; ;So it perhaps doesn't sound quite as... Or isn't quite as bad as it might sound.
94; ;00:11:05,142 --> 00:11:09,584; ;Let's wrap up this module then by looking at a couple more review questions.
95; ;00:11:09,584 --> 00:11:16,031; ;The first one, what type of Data Progression is used with an SC Series Flash-optimized solution?
96; ;00:11:16,031 --> 00:11:17,459; ;We just talked about that.
97; ;00:11:17,459 --> 00:11:19,350; ;Yep, On-demand Data Progression.
98; ;00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:27,701; ;In an SCv2000, what Storage Profile always keeps data in RAID 10 to increase performance?
99; ;00:11:29,446 --> 00:11:31,862; ;I'm going to give you the answer there, it's part of the question.
100; ;00:11:31,862 --> 00:11:34,002; ;Maximize Performance.
101; ;00:11:34,002 --> 00:11:37,297; ;Remember, that's a Storage Profile on an SCv2000.
102; ;00:11:37,297 --> 00:11:50,453; ;And finally, true or false, with traditional Data Progression if a volume has a tier 1 Storage Profile, it will move data to tier 3 based on inactivity for that volume.
103; ;00:11:50,453 --> 00:11:51,689; ;Is that true or false?
104; ;00:11:53,323 --> 00:11:54,365; ;False.
105; ;00:11:54,365 --> 00:11:57,215; ;Remember, it will always stay in tier 1.
106; ;00:11:57,215 --> 00:12:06,099; ;So if you set up a volume to be in the tier 1 Storage Profile, it will always stay in tier 1, it will not move down to any other tier.
1; ;00:00:01,464 --> 00:00:11,305; ;Let's start taking a deeper look into each of those 7.0 and 7.1 features by discussing deduplication and compression first.
2; ;00:00:11,305 --> 00:00:16,452; ;So as we talk about intelligent deduplication in the SC Series.
3; ;00:00:16,452 --> 00:00:28,462; ;There has been, since really the inception of the SC Series, there has always been ways of the software lowering the cost of performance of the arrays.
4; ;00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:34,280; ;RAID tiering, for example, occurs in arrays with multiple drive sizes.
5; ;00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:39,210; ;Now auto-tiering, that takes place within drives...
6; ;00:00:39,213 --> 00:00:44,981; ;If I don't have multiple drive sizes, we do auto-tiering in arrays with single drive size.
7; ;00:00:44,981 --> 00:00:49,694; ;All of this helps put the right data at the right place at the right time.
8; ;00:00:49,694 --> 00:00:58,870; ;So now both tiering approaches along with what we refer to as thin methods of things like volume provisioning, snapshots, replication.
9; ;00:00:58,870 --> 00:01:08,888; ;They've all combined a lower performance cost for SC Series customers, really from the beginning of when the SC Series was initially released.
10; ;00:01:08,888 --> 00:01:24,062; ;Now with the release of SC Series 7.0, we increased that cost of capacity by reducing that cost of capacity, by introducing intelligent deduplication and intelligent compression.
11; ;00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:34,030; ;Now the SC Series already offers the lowest cost per gigabyte of any all-flash array.
12; ;00:01:34,034 --> 00:01:43,582; ;Now that we add the most comprehensive data reduction functionality, that's going to bring that cost down even further.
13; ;00:01:43,582 --> 00:01:52,500; ;Now there are patented methods designed for this performance as well, so again, we're targeting the right data within each volume.
14; ;00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:52,511; ;To offer 10:1 reductions on full-speed writes, this provides for much better cache utilization.
Now there are patented methods designed for this performance as well, so again, we're targeting the right data within each volume.
15; ;00:01:52,511 --> 00:02:01,160; ;To offer 10:1 reductions on full-speed writes, this provides for much better cache utilization.
16; ;00:02:01,167 --> 00:02:14,066; ;Now this is going to reduce that cost of our already lowest cost per gigabyte to $0.45 per gig on an all-flash array for example.
17; ;00:02:14,066 --> 00:02:21,701; ;With the dedupe advantage, we see hard disk solution, hard disk tiers under $0.10 a gigabyte.
18; ;00:02:21,701 --> 00:02:29,910; ;And we support hybrid solutions which, of course, provide the advantage of both SSD and HDD technology.
19; ;00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:42,291; ;And keep in mind here that the SC Series is the only tiered architecture that combines deduplication and compression on both HDDs and SSDs.
20; ;00:02:42,291 --> 00:02:44,687; ;The hybrid solutions.
21; ;00:02:44,687 --> 00:02:50,805; ;So let's take a deeper look again at dedupe and compression and show that how that's really built for scalability.
22; ;00:02:50,805 --> 00:02:59,478; ;So what we're going to do is to look at some different scenarios and see in what scenarios dedupe works with compression and in what scenarios compression only works.
23; ;00:02:59,478 --> 00:03:04,042; ;So we'll start here with our first scenario and that's an all-flash solution.
24; ;00:03:04,042 --> 00:03:08,215; ;So with an all-flash solution, I have flash sitting in Tier 1.
25; ;00:03:08,215 --> 00:03:19,207; ;And in an all-flash solution, dedupe with compression is definitely supported since that's really the only tier in the solution and it is all-flash.
26; ;00:03:19,207 --> 00:03:25,505; ;Scenario two, we have Tier 1 flash and Tier 2 spinning disks.
27; ;00:03:25,505 --> 00:03:29,384; ;So when you look at is dedupe and compression supported?
28; ;00:03:29,384 --> 00:03:42,337; ;It is in Tier 1, which is the all-flash tier, and also dedupe and compression is supported in Tier 2 as well even though it is all HDDs.
29; ;00:03:42,337 --> 00:03:48,623; ;That's because we have a combination of flash and spinning in the same array.
30; ;00:03:48,623 --> 00:03:55,928; ;The next scenario, I've got flash in Tier 1 and I've got spinning disks in Tier 2 and Tier 3.
31; ;00:03:55,928 --> 00:04:11,339; ;So again, in Tier 1 dedupe works with compression, does not work on the spinning disks in Tier 2, but dedupe and compression does work in the spinning disks in Tier 3.
32; ;00:04:11,339 --> 00:04:22,221; ;Next, let's look at our fourth scenario, and this is going to be flash in Tier 1, flash in Tier 2, and spinning disks in Tier 3.
33; ;00:04:22,221 --> 00:04:36,172; ;So if we look at this in scenario four, the Tier 1 flash does not support dedupe with compression, but dedupe and compression is supported in Tier 2 and Tier 3 in scenario four.
34; ;00:04:37,434 --> 00:04:44,092; ;So let's look at three more scenarios and these are going to be focused on compression only.
35; ;00:04:44,092 --> 00:04:50,637; ;Now, the reason they're compression only is because we have all spinning disks in the arrays.
36; ;00:04:50,637 --> 00:04:55,090; ;So in the solution, I've got all spinning disks, if there is no flash drives...
37; ;00:04:55,090 --> 00:05:01,207; ;Remember, if there's no flash drives, there is no deduplication so it's going to be compression only.
38; ;00:05:01,207 --> 00:05:06,618; ;So in our example here of spinning disks in Tier 1, Tier 2, and Tier 3, right?
39; ;00:05:06,618 --> 00:05:17,909; ;Which means three different drive sizes, we don't get compression in Tier 1 or Tier 2, but we get compression on those big drives in Tier 3.
40; ;00:05:17,909 --> 00:05:20,563; ;Scenario six, what if I have only two tiers.
41; ;00:05:20,563 --> 00:05:27,505; ;Again, two different sizes of drives and since there is no flash that means I get compression only.
42; ;00:05:27,505 --> 00:05:35,168; ;In this scenario, I get no compression in the Tier 1 spinning disks, I do get compression in Tier 2.
43; ;00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:39,644; ;In our last scenario we're going to talk about, what if I have Tier 1...
44; ;00:05:39,644 --> 00:05:45,630; ;So I've got one size drive and it's all spinning disks, so they're all going to be in Tier 1.
45; ;00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:50,382; ;This is going to be compression will be supported in that scenario.
46; ;00:05:50,382 --> 00:05:56,200; ;Again, no dedupe, but with all spinning disks you do get compression.
47; ;00:05:56,200 --> 00:06:05,919; ;So as you can see from scenarios five, six, and seven, we still get compression even though we don't get deduplication in an all-spinning disk array.
48; ;00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:07,412; ;Let's take a look at a video.
49; ;00:06:07,412 --> 00:06:19,491; ;This video is designed to give a nice comparison of deduplication in the SC Series versus how deduplication is handled in many of our competitors.
50; ;00:06:24,905 --> 00:06:34,018; ;Hi, I'm John Shirley, and I'm here to talk to you about one of the most exciting features that we have coming out in Dell Storage in the first half of this year, which is deduplication.
51; ;00:06:34,018 --> 00:06:42,493; ;And specifically, I'm going to be talking to you about how our implementation of deduplication compares to the competition and how we're saving them more money and reducing complexity.
52; ;00:06:42,493 --> 00:06:43,625; ;So let's get going.
53; ;00:06:43,625 --> 00:06:51,971; ;All right, the first thing I want to explain is a very high level definition of what inline versus post-process deduplication is.
54; ;00:06:51,971 --> 00:07:02,855; ;All right so inline deduplication simply means that the data as it's coming into the array gets deduped before it hits the final resting place which, in this case we're going to be talking about, is SSD.
55; ;00:07:02,855 --> 00:07:10,745; ;Post process means it would be written to the SSD first and then at some point in the future, it would be deduped, okay?
56; ;00:07:10,745 --> 00:07:14,294; ;So let's stop and take a look at how our competition is doing it today.
57; ;00:07:14,294 --> 00:07:22,516; ;The first thing that we'll talk about is anybody who is doing inline deduplication today is doing it with a landing space.
58; ;00:07:22,516 --> 00:07:33,795; ;And so what a landing space really is, it is a bunch of high speed non-volatile memory.
59; ;00:07:38,223 --> 00:07:41,687; ;So NVRAM, that's non-volatile RAM.
60; ;00:07:41,687 --> 00:07:49,782; ;Now what happens is the writes come into non-volatile RAM, gets committed and then put down on the SSD at some point in the future.
61; ;00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:52,597; ;Here's the deal with non-volatile RAM.
62; ;00:07:54,609 --> 00:07:58,982; ;Non-volatile RAM is extremely expensive.
63; ;00:07:58,982 --> 00:08:09,291; ;So if we go look at how our competition is delivering their product to market, they're using very expensive hardware not only the NVRAM but also in the process of that and the memory subsystems underneath.
64; ;00:08:09,291 --> 00:08:13,829; ;Now let's take a look how the Dell SC Line is going to be deduplicating data.
65; ;00:08:13,829 --> 00:08:20,570; ;So we have a technology on arrays, if you're familiar with our Data Progression technology, it's called the write layer.
66; ;00:08:20,570 --> 00:08:30,471; ;So what the write layer is as we get data that comes into array, we get it down to media as fast as we can.
67; ;00:08:30,471 --> 00:08:35,140; ;So we stream data to the SSDs and we put it into RAID 10.
68; ;00:08:36,566 --> 00:08:42,439; ;Okay, RAID 10 again is splitting the data and it gets down to the SSD as fast as we possibly can.
69; ;00:08:42,439 --> 00:08:50,495; ;Then on a snapshot, we freeze the data and we convert that to a more efficient RAID technology, all right?
70; ;00:08:50,495 --> 00:08:56,324; ;So that right there is the, what technically will be called post process.
71; ;00:08:56,324 --> 00:08:58,688; ;However, let's take a look at what we're doing here.
72; ;00:08:58,688 --> 00:09:02,593; ;They have a write layer called NVRAM, again, very expensive.
73; ;00:09:02,590 --> 00:09:05,920; ;We have a write layer called RAID 10.
74; ;00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:12,880; ;So what we've effectively done is we've gotten the same performance that our competition is getting without spending the money.
75; ;00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,060; ;All right, and it gets even better than that.
76; ;00:09:15,072 --> 00:09:23,049; ;So after we do a write layer and we convert into the more efficient RAID on the SSD, either RAID 5 or RAID 6.
77; ;00:09:23,049 --> 00:09:27,995; ;Then what we do is we can progress that data down.
78; ;00:09:27,995 --> 00:09:32,202; ;So now we can take this down to hard drive.
79; ;00:09:33,437 --> 00:09:34,519; ;So what have we done here?
80; ;00:09:34,519 --> 00:09:43,838; ;Let's take a look at the competition, the competition somewhere is sitting anywhere between $1.50 a gigabyte and $2 a gigabyte.
81; ;00:09:45,539 --> 00:09:53,675; ;Our solution will get down to $0.45 a gigabyte.
82; ;00:09:54,939 --> 00:09:57,691; ;So roughly a third of what our competition is doing today.
83; ;00:09:57,691 --> 00:10:01,699; ;And the story gets better yet again when we talk about going down to hard drive.
84; ;00:10:01,699 --> 00:10:08,975; ;Hard drives will be somewhere around $0.05 a gigabyte.
85; ;00:10:08,975 --> 00:10:26,295; ;So what we've done effectively here is we significantly reduced the cost, we've kept our performance because of how we use our Data Progression technology, and we're doing this all without impacting host performance IO on the writes because we're able to do this Data Progression in the background.
86; ;00:10:26,295 --> 00:10:31,398; ;So thank you for listening and I hope you have a fun time selling deduplication to your customers.
87; ;00:10:38,226 --> 00:10:40,105; ;Let's talk about compression.
88; ;00:10:40,105 --> 00:10:48,323; ;Now this slide is going to focus on the original release of compression which was, as it says there, an SCOS 6.5.
89; ;00:10:48,323 --> 00:10:55,819; ;And then we'll talk about enhancements that came out in 6.7 and 7.0 in the next couple of slides.
90; ;00:10:55,819 --> 00:11:04,785; ;But for this slide, let's look at just give you a kind of a baseline of how compression worked when it was originally released back in 6.5.
91; ;00:11:06,422 --> 00:11:11,106; ;Of course, compression is part of the Data Progression license.
92; ;00:11:11,106 --> 00:11:20,989; ;So back in 6.5 when compression was released, a customer had to purchase the Data Progression license and he would get compression as part of that.
93; ;00:11:20,989 --> 00:11:32,141; ;So the way it worked is after data compression ran, all historical non-accessible pages on Tier 3 are compressed.
94; ;00:11:32,141 --> 00:11:39,654; ;So that's specifically the page had a status of historical non-accessible.
95; ;00:11:39,654 --> 00:11:42,787; ;Now if they were in Tier 3, they were compressed.
96; ;00:11:42,787 --> 00:11:47,191; ;So compression did not affect Tiers 1 and Tier 2.
97; ;00:11:47,191 --> 00:11:59,039; ;Now the Dell LZPS compressor, that's a proprietary approach to compression and it provides very fast compression as well as decompression.
98; ;00:12:01,496 --> 00:12:08,001; ;Compression can be enabled, disabled or even paused on a volume-by-volume basis.
99; ;00:12:09,123 --> 00:12:19,800; ;In a replication scenario, the administrator can choose to not use compression on the primary side and enable compression on the Disaster Recovery side.
100; ;00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:22,179; ;Now, what happens when you pause compression?
101; ;00:12:22,179 --> 00:12:32,804; ;Well, it suspends compression on further pages, but it does not rehydrate or decompress the existing compressed pages.
102; ;00:12:32,804 --> 00:12:41,085; ;So disabling compression cancels compression on further pages and it also rehydrates any existing compressed pages.
103; ;00:12:41,085 --> 00:12:45,489; ;Couple things involved in around support for compression in 6.5.
104; ;00:12:45,489 --> 00:12:52,777; ;Flash-optimized systems do not support compression unless Tier 3 is comprised of spinning drives.
105; ;00:12:52,777 --> 00:13:00,825; ;It's not supported in CompCU or PowerShell and snapshots and view volumes can contain compressed pages.
106; ;00:13:03,139 --> 00:13:08,614; ;We just talked about original release of compression with SCOS 6.5.
107; ;00:13:08,614 --> 00:13:17,071; ;Now let's take a look at differences between the original view of compression 6.5 and then current releases.
108; ;00:13:17,071 --> 00:13:27,465; ;So first of all, you'll notice that the SCOS compression is supported in SC9000, SC8000, SC7020, and SC4020.
109; ;00:13:27,465 --> 00:13:35,255; ;So obviously, it's not supported on SCv2000 or the older Series 40 systems.
110; ;00:13:35,255 --> 00:13:47,152; ;Now with the current release, as of SCOS 7.0, compression is available at no additional cost so it's part of that core software license.
111; ;00:13:48,711 --> 00:13:58,328; ;As of 6.7, it was also part of flash as well as spinning media both ways.
112; ;00:13:58,328 --> 00:14:08,265; ;So let's first look at, then let's go back and look at prior to 6.7, so this should be 6.5 and 6.6 - the initial releases of compression.
113; ;00:14:08,265 --> 00:14:20,782; ;As we said on the previous slide, it occurred on the lowest tier of storage in Tier 3, only occurs on spinning drives and it compressed only frozen inaccessible pages.
114; ;00:14:23,014 --> 00:14:32,295; ;In SCOS 6.7 compression, some of the enhancements then, it still occurred on the lowest tier.
115; ;00:14:32,295 --> 00:14:46,132; ;But now it could occur on both flash or spinning drives and it would compress all frozen pages whether they were inaccessible, as we had seen previously, or accessible.
116; ;00:14:46,132 --> 00:14:50,184; ;So it was on the lowest tier, but not just inaccessible.
117; ;00:14:50,184 --> 00:15:04,045; ;And then when SCOS 7.0 came out, compression occurred, as we talked about in our previous slide, it occurs by itself if it's an all-spinning drive solution or it occurs with deduplication.
118; ;00:15:04,045 --> 00:15:25,951; ;And then another option that really is a nice feature is it gives the administrator a choice of using the way that compression worked prior to 6.7, so the initial release, meaning to compress just inaccessible pages or you can have it either do accessible and inaccessible as it was in 6.7.
119; ;00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:35,555; ;So the advantage, of course, of doing it on frozen inaccessible pages in Tier 3 is there is no performance impact.
120; ;00:15:35,555 --> 00:15:45,359; ;So if you do it on accessible and inaccessible, there can be a performance impact because it's being done along with Data Progression.
121; ;00:15:46,748 --> 00:15:56,408; ;So here are some results from Dell's internal testing and showing some of the different applications and what kind of savings you can expect to see.
122; ;00:15:56,408 --> 00:16:12,443; ;Obviously results will vary, but Microsoft SQL is one that can go as high as 93% reduction in capacity and cost, with really with no negative impact to performance or really to user experience.
123; ;00:16:12,443 --> 00:16:24,342; ;Now remember, compression is transparent to applications and workloads because compression is fully integrated with and controlled by those Data Progression algorithms.
124; ;00:16:24,342 --> 00:16:35,014; ;So standard Data Progression always runs first, optimizing block placement within the array according to real-time access and usage patterns.
125; ;00:16:35,014 --> 00:16:45,117; ;Compression occurs only on the lowest tier within an array and of course, keep in mind, that can in Tier 1 if there's only a single-tier array in the solution.
126; ;00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:54,244; ;Now the SC Series customers that use compression, they can continue to take advantage of the rest of the SC features.
127; ;00:16:54,244 --> 00:17:07,574; ;So for example, if you've got Live Volume and you're replicating data between systems, compression may be configured independently for either the target or the source arrays.
128; ;00:17:07,574 --> 00:17:11,402; ;So the arrays can be fully mirrored or compressed at different levels.
129; ;00:17:11,402 --> 00:17:17,924; ;So it just depends on what the customer is looking for, it provides an awful lot of flexibility.
130; ;00:17:17,924 --> 00:17:30,140; ;Another example, snapshots can each contain compressed data, further demonstrating really the SC Series commitment to end-to-end integration and cost-savings.
1; ;00:00:01,464 --> 00:00:11,305; ;Let's start taking a deeper look into each of those 7.0 and 7.1 features by discussing deduplication and compression first.
2; ;00:00:11,305 --> 00:00:16,452; ;As we talk about intelligent deduplication in the SC Series.
3; ;00:00:16,452 --> 00:00:28,462; ;There has been, since really the inception of the SC Series, there has always been ways of the software lowering the cost of performance of the arrays.
4; ;00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:34,280; ;RAID tiering, for example, occurs in arrays with multiple drive sizes.
5; ;00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:39,210; ;Now auto-tiering, that takes place within drives...
6; ;00:00:39,213 --> 00:00:44,981; ;If I don't have multiple drive sizes, we do auto-tiering in arrays with single drive size.
7; ;00:00:44,981 --> 00:00:49,694; ;All of this helps put the right data at the right place at the right time.
8; ;00:00:49,694 --> 00:00:58,870; ;Now both tiering approaches along with what we refer to as thin methods of things like volume provisioning, snapshots, replication.
9; ;00:00:58,870 --> 00:01:08,888; ;They've all combined a lower performance cost for SC Series customers, really from the beginning of when the SC Series was initially released.
10; ;00:01:08,888 --> 00:01:24,062; ;Now with the release of SC Series 7.0, we increased that cost of capacity by reducing that cost of capacity, by introducing intelligent deduplication and intelligent compression.
11; ;00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:34,030; ;Now the SC Series already offers the lowest cost per gigabyte of any all-flash array.
12; ;00:01:34,034 --> 00:01:43,582; ;Now that we add the most comprehensive data reduction functionality, that's going to bring that cost down even further.
13; ;00:01:43,582 --> 00:01:52,500; ;Now there are patented methods designed for this performance as well, so again, we're targeting the right data within each volume.
14; ;00:01:52,500 --> 00:02:01,160; ;To offer 10:1 reductions on full-speed writes, this provides for much better cache utilization.
15; ;00:02:01,167 --> 00:02:14,066; ;Now this is going to reduce that cost of our already lowest cost per gigabyte to $0.45 per gig on an all-flash array for example.
16; ;00:02:14,066 --> 00:02:21,701; ;With the dedupe advantage, we see hard disk solution, hard disk tiers under $0.10 a gigabyte.
17; ;00:02:21,701 --> 00:02:29,910; ;And we support hybrid solutions which, of course, provide the advantage of both SSD and HDD technology.
18; ;00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:42,291; ;And keep in mind here that the SC Series is the only tiered architecture that combines deduplication and compression on both HDDs and SSDs.
19; ;00:02:42,291 --> 00:02:44,687; ;The hybrid solutions.
20; ;00:02:44,687 --> 00:02:50,805; ;Let's take a deeper look again at dedupe and compression and show that how that's really built for scalability.
21; ;00:02:50,805 --> 00:02:59,478; ;What we're going to do is to look at some different scenarios and see in what scenarios dedupe works with compression and in what scenarios compression only works.
22; ;00:02:59,478 --> 00:03:04,042; ;We'll start here with our first scenario and that's an all-flash solution.
23; ;00:03:04,042 --> 00:03:08,215; ;With an all-flash solution, I have flash sitting in Tier 1.
24; ;00:03:08,215 --> 00:03:19,207; ;And in an all-flash solution, dedupe with compression is definitely supported since that's really the only tier in the solution and it is all-flash.
25; ;00:03:19,207 --> 00:03:25,505; ;Scenario two, we have Tier 1 flash and Tier 2 spinning disks.
26; ;00:03:25,505 --> 00:03:29,384; ;When you look at is dedupe and compression supported?
27; ;00:03:29,384 --> 00:03:42,337; ;It is in Tier 1, which is the all-flash tier, and also dedupe and compression is supported in Tier 2 as well even though it is all HDDs.
28; ;00:03:42,337 --> 00:03:48,623; ;That's because we have a combination of flash and spinning in the same array.
29; ;00:03:48,623 --> 00:03:55,928; ;The next scenario, I've got flash in Tier 1 and I've got spinning disks in Tier 2 and Tier 3.
30; ;00:03:55,928 --> 00:04:11,339; ;Again, in Tier 1 dedupe works with compression, does not work on the spinning disks in Tier 2, but dedupe and compression does work in the spinning disks in Tier 3.
31; ;00:04:11,339 --> 00:04:22,221; ;Next, let's look at our fourth scenario, and this is going to be flash in Tier 1, flash in Tier 2, and spinning disks in Tier 3.
32; ;00:04:22,221 --> 00:04:36,172; ;If we look at this in scenario four, the Tier 1 flash does not support dedupe with compression, but dedupe and compression is supported in Tier 2 and Tier 3 in scenario four.
33; ;00:04:37,434 --> 00:04:44,092; ;Let's look at three more scenarios and these are going to be focused on compression only.
34; ;00:04:44,092 --> 00:04:50,637; ;Now, the reason they're compression only is because we have all spinning disks in the arrays.
35; ;00:04:50,637 --> 00:04:55,090; ;In the solution, I've got all spinning disks, if there is no flash drives...
36; ;00:04:55,090 --> 00:05:01,207; ;Remember, if there's no flash drives, there is no deduplication so it's going to be compression only.
37; ;00:05:01,207 --> 00:05:06,618; ;In our example here of spinning disks in Tier 1, Tier 2, and Tier 3, right?
38; ;00:05:06,618 --> 00:05:17,909; ;Which means three different drive sizes, we don't get compression in Tier 1 or Tier 2, but we get compression on those big drives in Tier 3.
39; ;00:05:17,909 --> 00:05:20,563; ;Scenario six, what if I have only two tiers.
40; ;00:05:20,563 --> 00:05:27,505; ;Again, two different sizes of drives and since there is no flash that means I get compression only.
41; ;00:05:27,505 --> 00:05:35,168; ;In this scenario, I get no compression in the Tier 1 spinning disks, I do get compression in Tier 2.
42; ;00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:39,644; ;In our last scenario we're going to talk about, what if I have Tier 1...
43; ;00:05:39,644 --> 00:05:45,630; ;I've got one size drive and it's all spinning disks, so they're all going to be in Tier 1.
44; ;00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:50,382; ;This is going to be compression will be supported in that scenario.
45; ;00:05:50,382 --> 00:05:56,200; ;Again, no dedupe, but with all spinning disks you do get compression.
46; ;00:05:56,200 --> 00:06:05,919; ;As you can see from scenarios five, six, and seven, we still get compression even though we don't get deduplication in an all-spinning disk array.
47; ;00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:07,412; ;Let's take a look at a video.
48; ;00:06:07,412 --> 00:06:19,491; ;This video is designed to give a nice comparison of deduplication in the SC Series versus how deduplication is handled in many of our competitors.
49; ;00:06:24,905 --> 00:06:34,018; ;Hi, I'm John Shirley, and I'm here to talk to you about one of the most exciting features that we have coming out in Dell Storage in the first half of this year, which is deduplication.
50; ;00:06:34,018 --> 00:06:42,493; ;And specifically, I'm going to be talking to you about how our implementation of deduplication compares to the competition and how we're saving them more money and reducing complexity.
51; ;00:06:42,493 --> 00:06:43,625; ;Let's get going.
52; ;00:06:43,625 --> 00:06:51,971; ;The first thing I want to explain is a very high level definition of what inline versus post-process deduplication is.
53; ;00:06:51,971 --> 00:07:02,855; ;Inline deduplication simply means that the data as it's coming into the array gets deduped before it hits the final resting place which, in this case we're going to be talking about, is SSD.
54; ;00:07:02,855 --> 00:07:10,745; ;Post process means it would be written to the SSD first and then at some point in the future, it would be deduped, okay?
55; ;00:07:10,745 --> 00:07:14,294; ;Let's stop and take a look at how our competition is doing it today.
56; ;00:07:14,294 --> 00:07:22,516; ;The first thing that we'll talk about is anybody who is doing inline deduplication today is doing it with a landing space.
57; ;00:07:22,516 --> 00:07:33,795; ;And so what a landing space really is, it is a bunch of high speed non-volatile memory.
58; ;00:07:38,223 --> 00:07:41,687; ;NVRAM, that's non-volatile RAM.
59; ;00:07:41,687 --> 00:07:49,782; ;Now what happens is the writes come into non-volatile RAM, gets committed and then put down on the SSD at some point in the future.
60; ;00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:52,597; ;Here's the deal with non-volatile RAM.
61; ;00:07:54,609 --> 00:07:58,982; ;Non-volatile RAM is extremely expensive.
62; ;00:07:58,982 --> 00:08:09,291; ;If we go look at how our competition is delivering their product to market, they're using very expensive hardware not only the NVRAM but also in the process of that and the memory subsystems underneath.
63; ;00:08:09,291 --> 00:08:13,829; ;Now let's take a look how the Dell SC Line is going to be deduplicating data.
64; ;00:08:13,829 --> 00:08:20,570; ;We have a technology on arrays, if you're familiar with our Data Progression technology, it's called the write layer.
65; ;00:08:20,570 --> 00:08:30,471; ;What the write layer is as we get data that comes into array, we get it down to media as fast as we can.
66; ;00:08:30,471 --> 00:08:35,140; ;We stream data to the SSDs and we put it into RAID 10.
67; ;00:08:36,566 --> 00:08:42,439; ;Okay, RAID 10 again is splitting the data and it gets down to the SSD as fast as we possibly can.
68; ;00:08:42,439 --> 00:08:50,495; ;Then on a snapshot, we freeze the data and we convert that to a more efficient RAID technology, all right?
69; ;00:08:50,495 --> 00:08:56,324; ;That right there is the, what technically will be called post process.
70; ;00:08:56,324 --> 00:08:58,688; ;However, let's take a look at what we're doing here.
71; ;00:08:58,688 --> 00:09:02,593; ;They have a write layer called NVRAM, again, very expensive.
72; ;00:09:02,590 --> 00:09:05,920; ;We have a write layer called RAID 10.
73; ;00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:12,880; ;What we've effectively done is we've gotten the same performance that our competition is getting without spending the money.
74; ;00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,060; ;All right, and it gets even better than that.
75; ;00:09:15,072 --> 00:09:23,049; ;After we do a write layer and we convert into the more efficient RAID on the SSD, either RAID 5 or RAID 6.
76; ;00:09:23,049 --> 00:09:27,995; ;Then what we do is we can progress that data down.
77; ;00:09:27,995 --> 00:09:32,202; ;Now we can take this down to hard drive.
78; ;00:09:33,437 --> 00:09:34,519; ;What have we done here?
79; ;00:09:34,519 --> 00:09:43,838; ;Let's take a look at the competition, the competition somewhere is sitting anywhere between $1.50 a gigabyte and $2 a gigabyte.
80; ;00:09:45,539 --> 00:09:53,675; ;Our solution will get down to $0.45 a gigabyte.
81; ;00:09:54,939 --> 00:09:57,691; ;Roughly a third of what our competition is doing today.
82; ;00:09:57,691 --> 00:10:01,699; ;And the story gets better yet again when we talk about going down to hard drive.
83; ;00:10:01,699 --> 00:10:08,975; ;Hard drives will be somewhere around $0.05 a gigabyte.
84; ;00:10:08,975 --> 00:10:26,295; ;What we've done effectively here is we significantly reduced the cost, we've kept our performance because of how we use our Data Progression technology, and we're doing this all without impacting host performance IO on the writes because we're able to do this Data Progression in the background.
85; ;00:10:26,295 --> 00:10:31,398; ;Thank you for listening and I hope you have a fun time selling deduplication to your customers.
86; ;00:10:38,226 --> 00:10:40,105; ;Let's talk about compression.
87; ;00:10:40,105 --> 00:10:48,323; ;Now this slide is going to focus on the original release of compression which was, as it says there, an SCOS 6.5.
88; ;00:10:48,323 --> 00:10:55,819; ;And then we'll talk about enhancements that came out in 6.7 and 7.0 in the next couple of slides.
89; ;00:10:55,819 --> 00:11:04,785; ;But for this slide, let's look at just give you a kind of a baseline of how compression worked when it was originally released back in 6.5.
90; ;00:11:06,422 --> 00:11:11,106; ;Of course, compression is part of the Data Progression license.
91; ;00:11:11,106 --> 00:11:20,989; ;Back in 6.5 when compression was released, a customer had to purchase the Data Progression license and he would get compression as part of that.
92; ;00:11:20,989 --> 00:11:32,141; ;The way it worked is after data compression ran, all historical non-accessible pages on Tier 3 are compressed.
93; ;00:11:32,141 --> 00:11:39,654; ;That's specifically the page had a status of historical non-accessible.
94; ;00:11:39,654 --> 00:11:42,787; ;Now if they were in Tier 3, they were compressed.
95; ;00:11:42,787 --> 00:11:47,191; ;Compression did not affect Tiers 1 and Tier 2.
96; ;00:11:47,191 --> 00:11:59,039; ;Now the Dell LZPS compressor, that's a proprietary approach to compression and it provides very fast compression as well as decompression.
97; ;00:12:01,496 --> 00:12:08,001; ;Compression can be enabled, disabled or even paused on a volume-by-volume basis.
98; ;00:12:09,123 --> 00:12:19,800; ;In a replication scenario, the administrator can choose to not use compression on the primary side and enable compression on the Disaster Recovery side.
99; ;00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:22,179; ;Now, what happens when you pause compression?
100; ;00:12:22,179 --> 00:12:32,804; ;Well, it suspends compression on further pages, but it does not rehydrate or decompress the existing compressed pages.
101; ;00:12:32,804 --> 00:12:41,085; ;Disabling compression cancels compression on further pages and it also rehydrates any existing compressed pages.
102; ;00:12:41,085 --> 00:12:45,489; ;Couple things involved in around support for compression in 6.5.
103; ;00:12:45,489 --> 00:12:52,777; ;Flash-optimized systems do not support compression unless Tier 3 is comprised of spinning drives.
104; ;00:12:52,777 --> 00:13:00,825; ;It's not supported in CompCU or PowerShell and snapshots and view volumes can contain compressed pages.
105; ;00:13:03,139 --> 00:13:08,614; ;We just talked about original release of compression with SCOS 6.5.
106; ;00:13:08,614 --> 00:13:17,071; ;Now let's take a look at differences between the original view of compression 6.5 and then current releases.
107; ;00:13:17,071 --> 00:13:27,465; ;First of all, you'll notice that the SCOS compression is supported in SC9000, SC8000, SC7020, and SC4020.
108; ;00:13:27,465 --> 00:13:35,255; ;Obviously, it's not supported on SCv2000 or the older Series 40 systems.
109; ;00:13:35,255 --> 00:13:47,152; ;Now with the current release, as of SCOS 7.0, compression is available at no additional cost so it's part of that core software license.
110; ;00:13:48,711 --> 00:13:58,328; ;As of 6.7, it was also part of flash as well as spinning media both ways.
111; ;00:13:58,328 --> 00:14:08,265; ;Let's first look at, then let's go back and look at prior to 6.7, so this should be 6.5 and 6.6 - the initial releases of compression.
112; ;00:14:08,265 --> 00:14:20,782; ;As we said on the previous slide, it occurred on the lowest tier of storage in Tier 3, only occurs on spinning drives and it compressed only frozen inaccessible pages.
113; ;00:14:23,014 --> 00:14:32,295; ;In SCOS 6.7 compression, some of the enhancements then, it still occurred on the lowest tier.
114; ;00:14:32,295 --> 00:14:46,132; ;But now it could occur on both flash or spinning drives and it would compress all frozen pages whether they were inaccessible, as we had seen previously, or accessible.
115; ;00:14:46,132 --> 00:14:50,184; ;It was on the lowest tier, but not just inaccessible.
116; ;00:14:50,184 --> 00:15:04,045; ;And then when SCOS 7.0 came out, compression occurred, as we talked about in our previous slide, it occurs by itself if it's an all-spinning drive solution or it occurs with deduplication.
117; ;00:15:04,045 --> 00:15:25,951; ;And then another option that really is a nice feature is it gives the administrator a choice of using the way that compression worked prior to 6.7, so the initial release, meaning to compress just inaccessible pages or you can have it either do accessible and inaccessible as it was in 6.7.
118; ;00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:35,555; ;The advantage, of course, of doing it on frozen inaccessible pages in Tier 3 is there is no performance impact.
119; ;00:15:35,555 --> 00:15:45,359; ;If you do it on accessible and inaccessible, there can be a performance impact because it's being done along with Data Progression.
120; ;00:15:46,748 --> 00:15:56,408; ;Here are some results from Dell's internal testing and showing some of the different applications and what kind of savings you can expect to see.
121; ;00:15:56,408 --> 00:16:12,443; ;Obviously results will vary, but Microsoft SQL is one that can go as high as 93% reduction in capacity and cost, with really with no negative impact to performance or really to user experience.
122; ;00:16:12,443 --> 00:16:24,342; ;Now remember, compression is transparent to applications and workloads because compression is fully integrated with and controlled by those Data Progression algorithms.
123; ;00:16:24,342 --> 00:16:35,014; ;Standard Data Progression always runs first, optimizing block placement within the array according to real-time access and usage patterns.
124; ;00:16:35,014 --> 00:16:45,117; ;Compression occurs only on the lowest tier within an array and of course, keep in mind, that can in Tier 1 if there's only a single-tier array in the solution.
125; ;00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:54,244; ;Now the SC Series customers that use compression, they can continue to take advantage of the rest of the SC features.
126; ;00:16:54,244 --> 00:17:07,574; ;For example, if you've got Live Volume and you're replicating data between systems, compression may be configured independently for either the target or the source arrays.
127; ;00:17:07,574 --> 00:17:11,402; ;The arrays can be fully mirrored or compressed at different levels.
128; ;00:17:11,402 --> 00:17:17,924; ;It just depends on what the customer is looking for, it provides an awful lot of flexibility.
129; ;00:17:17,924 --> 00:17:30,140; ;Another example, snapshots can each contain compressed data, further demonstrating really the SC Series commitment to end-to-end integration and cost-savings.
1; ;00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:05,691; ;Now it's time to talk about another feature of SCOS 7.0.
2; ;00:00:05,691 --> 00:00:08,339; ;That is quality of service.
3; ;00:00:08,339 --> 00:00:12,281; ;We refer to here it as storage Quality of Service, QoS.
4; ;00:00:15,006 --> 00:00:16,646; ;So what is QoS?
5; ;00:00:16,646 --> 00:00:22,020; ;Well, it maps storage resources to match the business priorities.
6; ;00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:32,874; ;What you can do with QoS is you can define resource limits for individual volumes or groups of volumes, offers a lot of flexibility.
7; ;00:00:32,874 --> 00:00:40,260; ;As an example, I can set up an individual volume to not run over 5,000 IOPS.
8; ;00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:47,128; ;I can set up a mission critical workload to make sure that it's always up.
9; ;00:00:47,128 --> 00:00:53,175; ;I can set up a group of volumes to only go to, say, for example here 10,000 IOPS.
10; ;00:00:53,175 --> 00:00:57,940; ;And there might be any number of that might be a completely different workload that's not mission critical.
11; ;00:00:57,940 --> 00:01:01,449; ;They might be in a separate series of groups.
12; ;00:01:01,449 --> 00:01:08,156; ;There's a lot of different, lot of flexibility that you've got with the QoS.
13; ;00:01:08,156 --> 00:01:10,803; ;Now QoS can be expressed...
14; ;00:01:10,803 --> 00:01:16,676; ;Performance level of course is typically expressed in IOPS, input/output per second.
15; ;00:01:17,796 --> 00:01:18,992; ;But it doesn't have to be.
16; ;00:01:18,992 --> 00:01:29,772; ;It can be expressed in megabytes per second if throughput is more significant for the customer or it can be analyzed by latency as well.
17; ;00:01:29,772 --> 00:01:34,948; ;QoS works not only on standard volumes, but it also works on VVols as well.
18; ;00:01:39,656 --> 00:01:47,816; ;There's, as we said, multiple different ways to prioritize how you want to set up QoS.
19; ;00:01:50,058 --> 00:01:52,109; ;What are some of the things that QoS can do?
20; ;00:01:52,109 --> 00:01:56,174; ;Well, it ensures top performance for the most important workloads.
21; ;00:01:56,174 --> 00:02:05,216; ;I can set relative priorities among volumes and what this does, it eliminates that noisy neighbor problem.
22; ;00:02:05,216 --> 00:02:13,445; ;Where one server or one application is grabbing more bandwidth than it really is entitled to.
23; ;00:02:13,445 --> 00:02:30,611; ;It's easy to customize, easy to apply QoS, it comes with user-defined alerts, it's scriptable via the RESTful interface and it's included as part of the Storage Profile functionality within the Dell Storage Manger.
24; ;00:02:30,611 --> 00:02:43,272; ;From a reporting standpoint, you can track the impact of your QoS settings over time to get a feel if you need to change them or what impact they have at all.
25; ;00:02:43,272 --> 00:02:55,992; ;And it's really ideal for enterprise departments, for private cloud, for multi-tenancy, so think service providers when you think of Quality of Service.
26; ;00:02:57,464 --> 00:03:00,928; ;Let's look at some use cases for QoS.
27; ;00:03:02,848 --> 00:03:15,554; ;It supports both enterprise and multi-tenant use cases and one big thing is it solves the noisy neighbor problem in both enterprise and multi-tenant environments.
28; ;00:03:15,554 --> 00:03:18,897; ;Helps manage traffic for the service provider.
29; ;00:03:18,897 --> 00:03:25,198; ;It makes sure more important volumes get more bandwidth, this is especially huge during congestion.
30; ;00:03:25,198 --> 00:03:36,229; ;Supports bursting to better utilize available bandwidth and finally, it provides feedback by reporting on the impact of the QoS settings.
31; ;00:03:37,619 --> 00:03:42,755; ;QoS can be set up by volume and/or groups of volumes.
32; ;00:03:44,426 --> 00:03:52,675; ;QoS profiles are used to set up and manage hard limits for both individual volumes and groups of volumes as we mentioned.
33; ;00:03:52,675 --> 00:03:58,142; ;You have a QoS profile, so that's something in the Dell Storage Manager interface.
34; ;00:03:58,142 --> 00:04:05,193; ;You set up a QoS profile and we'll walk you through some of this in the interface in a few moments.
35; ;00:04:05,193 --> 00:04:13,369; ;I have the QoS profile, now I can set up hard limits for IOPS or megabytes per second.
36; ;00:04:13,369 --> 00:04:18,111; ;And of course, that can be done by an individual volume or groups of volumes.
37; ;00:04:18,111 --> 00:04:25,888; ;I can have alerts that the volume is exceeding latency thresholds, now that's an important one.
38; ;00:04:25,888 --> 00:04:32,676; ;And also, the QoS profile can be used to do resource balancing dynamically.
39; ;00:04:34,313 --> 00:04:39,313; ;I can have multiple profiles.
40; ;00:04:39,313 --> 00:04:45,649; ;Here, we just look at QoS profile 1, I assign that profile to volumes one and two.
41; ;00:04:47,029 --> 00:04:50,359; ;Now I have QoS profile 2.
42; ;00:04:50,359 --> 00:05:04,570; ;Now that can be applied individually to volume 3, volume 4, or volume 5, or I can set up a QoS profile that would cover this group of volumes 3, 4, and 5.
43; ;00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:13,952; ;I can do it, I have a lot of flexibility there and then maybe I have another QoS profile that might go just to volume 6.
44; ;00:05:13,952 --> 00:05:24,656; ;These profiles can be created for different volumes or groups of volumes as we said, but only one profile can be assigned to a volume at a time.
45; ;00:05:25,908 --> 00:05:40,739; ;It will be important for administrators to understand how to set up QoS in the Dell Storage Manager and really the reason for this is that QoS profiles are not enabled by default.
46; ;00:05:40,739 --> 00:05:49,511; ;If an administrator wants to use QoS, he needs to know how to go in and set it up in the Dell Storage Manager.
47; ;00:05:49,511 --> 00:05:57,185; ;Now keep in mind that the SC Series must be running a minimum SCOS of 7.0.
48; ;00:05:57,185 --> 00:06:14,696; ;In our example here the SC25, which is one of six SC Series that are being managed from this Dell Storage Manager, that is the only one of the six that is actually running SCOS 7.0.
49; ;00:06:14,696 --> 00:06:20,047; ;So it's the only that you'll actually be able to set up QoS.
50; ;00:06:20,047 --> 00:06:28,665; ;In our case here, the way we're going to do it is we're going to highlight SC25, click on Edit Settings.
51; ;00:06:28,665 --> 00:06:33,526; ;So when you click on Edit Settings, you'll get a new screen, the screen looks like this.
52; ;00:06:33,526 --> 00:06:44,822; ;We're going to highlight Preferences and when you highlight Preferences down at the bottom, you have an option of Quality of Service Profiles.
53; ;00:06:44,822 --> 00:06:51,592; ;You have to go down and you have to check Allow QoS Profile Selection.
54; ;00:06:51,592 --> 00:06:57,201; ;If you don't do that, you're not going to be able to use this QoS functionality.
55; ;00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:10,713; ;Once you check that Allow QoS Profile selection then you stay within the Edit Settings, this time choosing the selection called Storage.
56; ;00:07:10,713 --> 00:07:21,114; ;When you choose that selection called Storage right beneath Preferences there, you'll go down here and you'll see an option of Quality of Service Control.
57; ;00:07:21,114 --> 00:07:31,278; ;You have the option of QoS Limits Enabled and then Server Load Equalizer Enabled and then a Latency Goal you can put that in.
58; ;00:07:31,278 --> 00:07:49,421; ;You can set it up how you want but once you set those up, you're now ready to add QoS profiles for the individual volumes or groups of volumes for this particular SC Series, SC25 in this case.
59; ;00:07:51,207 --> 00:07:55,517; ;Let's look at creating a QoS profile in the Dell Storage Manager.
60; ;00:07:55,517 --> 00:07:59,000; ;Creating a QoS profile requires the following items.
61; ;00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,711; ;I need a profile name and a profile type.
62; ;00:08:02,711 --> 00:08:08,192; ;The type is either volume QoS or group QoS.
63; ;00:08:08,192 --> 00:08:20,083; ;So if a group QoS profile is created, the limits for that profile are applied to the aggregate of all the volumes with the profile applied.
64; ;00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:27,267; ;Let's take a look here at the DSM interface and get a look at what's involved with setting up.
65; ;00:08:27,267 --> 00:08:39,213; ;So you can see, in this case, we've got QoS profile 1, it's under volume QoS profiles and I can apply that to specific volumes then.
66; ;00:08:39,213 --> 00:08:45,167; ;Notice the other option there of Group QoS Profiles, I've got either choice.
67; ;00:08:45,167 --> 00:08:51,199; ;So if I say create a new one, this is what the screen looks like.
68; ;00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:55,782; ;All right, now it gives a little warning right upfront there.
69; ;00:08:55,782 --> 00:09:06,459; ;Enabling any of the QoS limits, IOs per second or megabytes per second, could have adverse effects on overall system performance.
70; ;00:09:06,459 --> 00:09:12,772; ;Again, QoS limits for the Storage Center are disabled.
71; ;00:09:12,772 --> 00:09:19,072; ;Any profile limits configured will not be enforced until global limits are enabled.
72; ;00:09:19,072 --> 00:09:24,907; ;Remember, that's what we just talked about, you have to set up those initial limits first.
73; ;00:09:24,907 --> 00:09:31,853; ;The Server Load Equalizer for the Storage Center is disabled, Relative Priority will not be enforced until it is enabled.
74; ;00:09:31,853 --> 00:09:40,971; ;Again, in both cases, you need to have those set up in order for that functionality to work.
75; ;00:09:40,971 --> 00:09:48,829; ;Some other QoS configuration options include the ability to limit a volume's IOPS or bandwidth.
76; ;00:09:48,829 --> 00:10:00,886; ;The intent of these is if you check those and put in a max IOPS allowed or max megabytes per second allowed, this helps solve the noisy neighbor problem.
77; ;00:10:00,886 --> 00:10:10,914; ;If you check that box and no value is entered, it assumes the bandwidth is unlimited or unrestricted, so keep that in mind too.
78; ;00:10:10,914 --> 00:10:15,637; ;You also have the ability to limit a group of volumes to the same functionality.
79; ;00:10:15,637 --> 00:10:24,243; ;So if I clicked on Group QoS Profile, I have the same functionality there to limit by IOPS or by bandwidth.
80; ;00:10:24,243 --> 00:10:30,812; ;This prevents a tenant from consuming too many IOPS or too much bandwidth.
81; ;00:10:30,812 --> 00:10:37,691; ;A user can also limit specific volumes in a group to solve the noisy problem within an individual tenant.
82; ;00:10:38,976 --> 00:10:44,272; ;You also have an option to set a volume's latency alert threshold.
83; ;00:10:44,272 --> 00:10:50,365; ;We saw that previously and you also see it here, Enable Latency Threshold Alert.
84; ;00:10:50,365 --> 00:10:55,376; ;This provides feedback if the QoS parameters are set correctly.
85; ;00:10:55,376 --> 00:11:01,334; ;Now keep in mind that overly aggressive QoS settings can actually increase latency in some cases.
86; ;00:11:01,334 --> 00:11:08,903; ;Some of this you almost have to play with it initially and see how it flows in the customer's environment.
87; ;00:11:08,903 --> 00:11:12,654; ;I also have the ability to set up a volume's relative priority.
88; ;00:11:12,654 --> 00:11:19,876; ;Now this enables the user to give more IO opportunity to important volumes during a congested time period.
89; ;00:11:21,913 --> 00:11:31,227; ;Last couple of things, you have the ability to set an average system latency threshold for declaring when a system is congested.
90; ;00:11:31,227 --> 00:11:39,594; ;And finally, volume QoS reporting, so a user can view the impact and correctness of QoS settings over time.
1; ;00:00:01,701 --> 00:00:04,474; ;Let's get started with Dell Storage Manager.
2; ;00:00:04,474 --> 00:00:10,474; ;And the first thing we're going to do is define what Dell Storage Manager is and how it works.
3; ;00:00:10,474 --> 00:00:20,801; ;Let's get started with a discussion question, what is the minimum version of Dell Storage Manager required to manage an SC7020?
4; ;00:00:20,801 --> 00:00:29,153; ;As we do with all discussion questions, we'll think about it, we'll answer the question here, and then we'll relay the answer as we go through the module.
5; ;00:00:29,153 --> 00:00:35,895; ;The answer to the discussion question, DSM 2016 R2.
6; ;00:00:35,895 --> 00:00:40,644; ;That's the minimum requirement to run an SC7020.
7; ;00:00:40,644 --> 00:00:43,567; ;So what is Dell Storage Manager?
8; ;00:00:43,567 --> 00:00:47,428; ;It will be referred to very often throughout this training as DSM.
9; ;00:00:47,428 --> 00:00:53,167; ;It's really based on Enterprise Manager software.
10; ;00:00:53,167 --> 00:01:02,168; ;Enterprise Manager software, for those of you who have used the SC Series in the past, you're quite familiar with Enterprise Manager.
11; ;00:01:02,168 --> 00:01:06,500; ;It was another way to manage the SC Series.
12; ;00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:10,872; ;So what it really is is a re-branding of Enterprise Manager.
13; ;00:01:10,872 --> 00:01:16,553; ;For those of you who are not familiar with Enterprise Manager, not to worry, no big deal.
14; ;00:01:16,553 --> 00:01:19,413; ;But it's really based on Enterprise Manager.
15; ;00:01:19,413 --> 00:01:21,605; ;It's the exact same look and feel.
16; ;00:01:21,605 --> 00:01:26,097; ;There are some new features and we'll talk about those new features throughout the module.
17; ;00:01:26,097 --> 00:01:41,579; ;But all the existing Enterprise Manager features are still there: things such as threshold alerts, automatic reports, those kind of things are all in DSM just as they were in Enterprise Manager before.
18; ;00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:55,191; ;Earlier releases of Dell Storage Manager, as we said, the Enterprise Manager was actually one of two vehicles that could be used to manage the SC Series storage array.
19; ;00:01:55,191 --> 00:01:57,206; ;Enterprise Manager was one.
20; ;00:01:57,206 --> 00:02:02,953; ;And the Compellent Storage Center had its own user interface as well.
21; ;00:02:02,953 --> 00:02:13,033; ;So a lot of our users got more familiar with that Storage Center user interface than the SC Series - or, excuse me, than Enterprise Manager.
22; ;00:02:13,033 --> 00:02:17,647; ;With this release, the Storage Center user interface will go away.
23; ;00:02:17,647 --> 00:02:23,523; ;And we'll kind of point that out in a little bit more detail a little bit further on down the slide.
24; ;00:02:23,523 --> 00:02:33,437; ;One of the big features of DSM is that we now incorporate management of PS Series groups.
25; ;00:02:33,437 --> 00:02:45,925; ;This has started with the Dell Storage Manager 2016 R1 and it goes hand-in-hand with the SCOS release 7.0.
26; ;00:02:45,925 --> 00:02:51,574; ;As of that release, DSM became PS ready.
27; ;00:02:51,574 --> 00:03:02,891; ;PS Series' day-to-day management and cross-platform replication is now integrated into the existing DSM client.
28; ;00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:15,076; ;It provides links into the PS Series Group Manager, it does not everything that the PS Series Group Manager did, but it does the day-to-day activities.
29; ;00:03:15,076 --> 00:03:21,934; ;And as DSM matures, you'll see more and more management of the PS groups.
30; ;00:03:21,934 --> 00:03:26,160; ;The goal of DSM is to provide that common landing spot.
31; ;00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:33,125; ;SC and PS storage products are all managed from the DSM.
32; ;00:03:33,125 --> 00:03:39,334; ;As an example, one of the things that's managed today from the DSM is FluidFS.
33; ;00:03:39,334 --> 00:03:43,130; ;FluidFS is our NAS appliance.
34; ;00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:53,232; ;FS8600, for example, that's managed from the Dell Storage Manager just as it was from Enterprise Manager.
35; ;00:03:53,232 --> 00:04:05,296; ;The other thing is managing plugins, so VMware and Oracle integrations, Windows, Linux integrations, they're all managed from the Dell Storage Manager.
36; ;00:04:05,296 --> 00:04:17,599; ;The whole idea is that DSM becomes the engine that will drive common management for current as well as future Dell Storage products.
37; ;00:04:17,599 --> 00:04:25,284; ;Just kind of a note there on the bottom that DSM is the sole user interface for all SC platforms.
38; ;00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:33,122; ;The Storage Center GUI ceases to exist for all platforms as of SC 7.0.
39; ;00:04:33,122 --> 00:04:41,171; ;You won't even have the luxury of managing with the old Storage Center user interface.
40; ;00:04:41,171 --> 00:04:57,170; ;The Dell Storage Manager simplifies storage management by providing a single centralized console for the administration of SC Series SANs and some day-to-day features of PS Series SANs.
41; ;00:04:57,170 --> 00:05:11,300; ;DSM users can monitor, manage, and measure SC Series from a single centralized console and generate comprehensive enterprise storage usage reports, as well as performance reports.
42; ;00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:19,970; ;DSM is used to manage all models of Storage Center arrays including our entry level SCv2000.
43; ;00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:29,823; ;One thing that's unique about the v2000 is it's the only series that can be installed by a customer.
44; ;00:05:29,823 --> 00:05:34,524; ;And they use DSM to go through this installation process.
45; ;00:05:34,524 --> 00:05:40,646; ;The rest of the SC Series models have to be installed by a certified installer.
46; ;00:05:40,646 --> 00:05:52,847; ;The SC 4020, 7020, 8000, and 9000 are all managed from DSM and legacy systems as well, which would include the Series 40.
47; ;00:05:52,847 --> 00:06:02,234; ;Other features of Dell Storage Manager include the ability to Manage Multiple Systems at one time from a single pane of glass.
48; ;00:06:02,234 --> 00:06:08,641; ;So you can kind of see in the red box here, we're managing five systems from one pane of glass.
49; ;00:06:08,641 --> 00:06:11,693; ;And those systems can be different types of systems as well.
50; ;00:06:11,693 --> 00:06:15,993; ;They don't have to all be SC9000s or SC7020.
51; ;00:06:15,993 --> 00:06:20,799; ;It can be any combination of SC Series systems.
52; ;00:06:20,799 --> 00:06:35,792; ;And we also have the ability to manage local and remote SC Series systems as well as PS Series groups, volume and snapshot replication as well, plus, as we said, FS8600 management.
53; ;00:06:38,569 --> 00:06:41,878; ;Also, the ability to set up replication in six clicks.
54; ;00:06:41,878 --> 00:06:50,008; ;The idea there is that it's very simple to do, to set up replication, okay?
55; ;00:06:50,008 --> 00:06:52,791; ;And again, it's all done from that one single pane of glass.
56; ;00:06:52,791 --> 00:06:59,567; ;You can access the local and the remote site where you'll be doing those replications.
57; ;00:06:59,567 --> 00:07:04,779; ;The next is Storage Resource Management or SRM.
58; ;00:07:04,779 --> 00:07:18,581; ;Storage Resource Management basically just means I can view real-time and historical consumption for specific storage volumes over time to kind of balance server loads and potentially increase purchasing efficiency.
59; ;00:07:20,191 --> 00:07:22,292; ;Powerful threshold alerting.
60; ;00:07:22,292 --> 00:07:39,942; ;This has always been a key feature of Enterprise Manager, the ability to do threshold alerts that will send emails or alert storage administrators when IO level reaches a certain level on a volume or when consumption or capacity goes over a limit.
61; ;00:07:41,751 --> 00:07:48,914; ;There's a lot of different functionality with threshold alerting, and we'll talk more about that later on in the module.
62; ;00:07:48,914 --> 00:08:00,271; ;And then finally, chargeback, this is a feature that can be real powerful because it allows storage admins to manage the actual cost of storage usage per department.
63; ;00:08:00,271 --> 00:08:08,880; ;And then potentially assign costs to department based on the usage of the applications that they have.
64; ;00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:21,615; ;The chargeback software can assign a different cost to each volume based on, for example, what disk class it's in, what storage tier it's in, those type of thing.
65; ;00:08:21,615 --> 00:08:31,920; ;Some of the key benefits really of DSM include cutting administrators' time with that single interface and a complete view of everything that's happening in the network.
66; ;00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:50,845; ;Simplified disaster recovery, easy online replications as we saw, speed event resolution with centralized alert notifications, and optimized performance by allowing the administrator to identify and manage trends in the environment.
67; ;00:08:50,845 --> 00:08:58,152; ;We'll start to look at the DSM interface by first just looking at the summary view.
68; ;00:08:58,152 --> 00:09:04,660; ;I'm just in Dell Storage Manager, I highlighted Storage down here on SC25.
69; ;00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:06,221; ;And I'm just on the Summary tab.
70; ;00:09:06,221 --> 00:09:10,193; ;A lot of good information you can see right from the Summary tab.
71; ;00:09:10,193 --> 00:09:20,426; ;Right in here I can see how much configured disk space, available space, how much free space - 40.83 terabytes in this case - and how much used space.
72; ;00:09:20,426 --> 00:09:26,776; ;There's a lot of good information I can get right from the Summary screen just from going in here to start.
73; ;00:09:26,776 --> 00:09:28,012; ;There's alerts.
74; ;00:09:28,012 --> 00:09:34,630; ;I have Current Alerts and I also have Threshold Alerts.
75; ;00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:38,165; ;So a lot of information right here from the Summary screen.
76; ;00:09:38,165 --> 00:09:42,933; ;There's an Object Count, how many volumes are in the system, how many volumes have I set up.
77; ;00:09:42,933 --> 00:09:46,942; ;Well, SC25 has got 20 volumes set up.
78; ;00:09:46,942 --> 00:09:51,920; ;I've got four servers established,  and there's disks.
79; ;00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:55,811; ;So you can see all of those things right here, the number of snapshots.
80; ;00:09:55,811 --> 00:10:02,390; ;A lot of information just by looking at the main Summary view screen.
81; ;00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:07,358; ;There's also kind of a quick starter which gives us some common actions right here.
82; ;00:10:07,358 --> 00:10:19,899; ;Right on the main screen I can create a volume, I can create a server, there's support assist actions where I can send information to the support assist group.
83; ;00:10:19,899 --> 00:10:25,350; ;So there's a lot of information I can get just from the Summary screen.
84; ;00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:28,858; ;And specific alerts are shown down here.
85; ;00:10:28,858 --> 00:10:34,969; ;You see the Current Alerts, and they can even be acknowledged from the Current Alerts table.
86; ;00:10:34,969 --> 00:10:45,114; ;Later on in the module, we're going to show a lot more screen captures and screen grabs to give you even more detail on what you can get from DSM.
87; ;00:10:45,114 --> 00:10:52,572; ;A couple of other things, just on the Summary screen, you see this summary here, similar to what you saw up here on the top.
88; ;00:10:52,572 --> 00:10:56,554; ;But also you see savings from one RAID type to another.
89; ;00:10:56,554 --> 00:11:08,524; ;Also, you have something called the 10 Fastest Growing Volumes, that can be a real valuable tool in trying to figure out where you need to put resources in your SC Series.
90; ;00:11:08,524 --> 00:11:14,123; ;Let's look at the Dell Storage Manager components, what pieces make up DSM.
91; ;00:11:14,123 --> 00:11:17,577; ;It depends on what you're looking to manage.
92; ;00:11:17,577 --> 00:11:25,825; ;So if you want to manage multiple Storage Center systems or multiple SC Series systems, here are the components that you'll need.
93; ;00:11:25,825 --> 00:11:32,640; ;You'll need the Data Collector as well as the Dell Storage Client.
94; ;00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:41,792; ;The Data Collector has to be installed if you're going to manage multiple SC Series systems.
95; ;00:11:41,792 --> 00:11:54,008; ;If you're just going to manage a single system from DSM, you can just go and directly set up the Dell Storage Client.
96; ;00:11:54,008 --> 00:11:58,488; ;But if you're using Multiple Storage Center systems, you want to use the Data Collector.
97; ;00:11:58,488 --> 00:12:11,650; ;The Data Collector, for the most part, is encouraged really because as far as accumulating information for multiple systems in the array, Data Collector is huge.
98; ;00:12:11,650 --> 00:12:21,754; ;The other option is if I'm just going to manage a single system, if I don't have a Data Collector, then, as I said, we can just install the Dell Storage Client.
99; ;00:12:23,239 --> 00:12:30,762; ;The Client can manage multiple SC Series systems if you've got a Data Collector or it can manage a single system.
100; ;00:12:30,762 --> 00:12:37,867; ;It manages the Dell Storage Center, anything from SCOS version 6.3 and above.
101; ;00:12:37,867 --> 00:12:45,602; ;So it goes quite a ways back, even before it became the DSM, back when it was Enterprise Manager up to the current.
102; ;00:12:45,602 --> 00:12:55,747; ;It will also manage PS Series group firmware, anything starting with 7.0 through the current revision of the PS Series 9.0.
103; ;00:12:55,747 --> 00:12:58,110; ;It manages the FS8600.
104; ;00:12:59,690 --> 00:13:07,115; ;It does SCVMM, the Microsoft System Center Virtual Machine Manager, it will manage that.
105; ;00:13:07,115 --> 00:13:13,853; ;It will manage VMware's vCenter Site Recovery Manager, SRM, okay?
106; ;00:13:13,853 --> 00:13:19,495; ;And also a CITV appliance version 4.0 can be managed from here.
107; ;00:13:19,495 --> 00:13:24,457; ;There's a lot of functionality built in with the Dell Storage Client.
108; ;00:13:24,457 --> 00:13:29,844; ;Then the other component that makes up DSM is the Windows server agent.
109; ;00:13:29,844 --> 00:13:38,288; ;The server agent gets installed on Windows servers and it easily presents and manages attached volumes.
110; ;00:13:38,288 --> 00:13:52,042; ;This is definitely considered optional besides the fact that you don't have Windows servers in the environment, if there's Windows servers versions older than 2012, this is a pretty critical piece.
111; ;00:13:52,042 --> 00:14:01,100; ;Because it allows DSM to free volume storage space from expired replays that would otherwise remain locked within Windows.
112; ;00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:13,509; ;So it really syncs up the amount of storage that the SC Series says you have versus the amount of space that the Windows server says that it has.
113; ;00:14:13,509 --> 00:14:20,835; ;But starting with Windows 2012, all of that is now managed within the Windows OS.
114; ;00:14:20,835 --> 00:14:27,368; ;So that's not quite as critical a piece as it was prior to Windows 2012.
115; ;00:14:27,368 --> 00:14:35,230; ;If it is installed, you see server information, you see the assigned storage, you see version information.
116; ;00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:43,000; ;So there is certainly some value there even if it doesn't do the free space as it used to.
117; ;00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:47,709; ;It can be installed on a Hyper-V host server and any VMs running Windows.
118; ;00:14:49,093 --> 00:14:55,474; ;And if running VMware, the server agent can be installed on virtual machines running Windows.
119; ;00:14:55,474 --> 00:15:01,937; ;It's supported on any 64-bit operating system with the latest service packs.
120; ;00:15:01,937 --> 00:15:06,135; ;So it does require a 64-bit OS as does the Data Collector.
121; ;00:15:06,135 --> 00:15:24,548; ;It supports Windows Server 2008 R2 either full or core installations, Storage Server 2008 R2, Windows 2012 full or core installation, Windows 2012 R2, either full or core installation.
122; ;00:15:24,548 --> 00:15:32,489; ;And it does support .NET Framework 4.0, the full feature.
123; ;00:15:34,009 --> 00:15:42,846; ;The traditional approach to managing Storage Centers through DSM is a client-server relationship.
124; ;00:15:42,846 --> 00:15:52,261; ;That is a server is installed, a Windows server is the Data Collector and it points to each Storage Center that you wanted to manage.
125; ;00:15:52,261 --> 00:16:04,297; ;We see like an SC9000 here and we see an SC4020, it manages those all from this Data Collector server.
126; ;00:16:04,297 --> 00:16:09,846; ;Then the client also communicates with that Data Collector server as well.
127; ;00:16:09,846 --> 00:16:18,864; ;That client can be workstations running Dell Storage Client 2015 R1 or greater.
128; ;00:16:18,864 --> 00:16:21,083; ;It's been a while now.
129; ;00:16:21,083 --> 00:16:27,733; ;We're on 2016 R2 is the version as of this recording.
130; ;00:16:27,733 --> 00:16:38,143; ;You see how that's then the traditional approach to management of the Dell Storage through the DSM.
131; ;00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:51,491; ;As of SCOS version 6.6, the functionality to direct connect and manage an SC Series right from the Dell Storage Client became available.
132; ;00:16:51,491 --> 00:17:02,664; ;So you log in using the management IP address and the credentials of the Storage Center and you point that IP address or DNS to the Storage Center.
133; ;00:17:02,664 --> 00:17:09,735; ;And of course, any SC Series solutions can be managed this way.
134; ;00:17:09,735 --> 00:17:18,875; ;The other thing when we back up to here using the Data Collector, these Storage Centers do not necessarily have to be the same version of SCOS.
135; ;00:17:18,875 --> 00:17:27,637; ;So you could have a version that is on 7.1, you could have a version that's back on 6.6 or 6.7 for example.
136; ;00:17:27,637 --> 00:17:31,402; ;All could be managed from that Data Collector server.
137; ;00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:35,809; ;Let's look at the DSM Client requirements.
138; ;00:17:35,809 --> 00:17:40,019; ;What does that server need to be?
139; ;00:17:40,019 --> 00:17:48,244; ;It can be Windows or Linux, .NET Framework 4.0, and web browser.
140; ;00:17:48,244 --> 00:17:51,446; ;So there are different web browsers that are supported.
141; ;00:17:51,446 --> 00:18:03,508; ;As of when this video was put together, it's Internet Explorer 11, Firefox, Chrome, Microsoft Edge.
142; ;00:18:03,508 --> 00:18:09,581; ;Some other web browsers work, but they're not officially supported.
143; ;00:18:09,581 --> 00:18:12,480; ;But those are the ones that are officially supported.
144; ;00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:18,213; ;The requirements for the Storage Client 2016.
145; ;00:18:18,213 --> 00:18:27,874; ;They can be 32 or 64-bit, which is different than the Data Collector and the server running the server agent.
146; ;00:18:27,874 --> 00:18:31,878; ;They can be 32 or 64-bit with the latest service packs.
147; ;00:18:31,878 --> 00:18:41,580; ;The Windows versions that are supported are Windows 8, Windows 8.1, Windows 10, and Windows Server 2008.
148; ;00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:44,073; ;Those can be 32 or 64-bit.
149; ;00:18:44,073 --> 00:19:08,346; ;As far as 64-bit only, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Server 2012 or 2012 R2, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.7, 7, or 7.1, SUSE Linux Enterprise 12, Oracle Linux 6.5 and 7.0.
150; ;00:19:08,346 --> 00:19:17,010; ;These are all versions that are supported with the Dell Storage Manager Client.
151; ;00:19:17,010 --> 00:19:26,014; ;We just talked about the DSM client requirements, now let's talk about the Dell Storage Manager Data Collector requirements.
152; ;00:19:26,014 --> 00:19:35,327; ;Remember that the Data Collector manager must have access to the same IP network to which the Storage Center management ports are connected.
153; ;00:19:35,327 --> 00:19:40,125; ;And that is the same network that the client is on as well.
154; ;00:19:40,125 --> 00:19:52,395; ;That's the only way that the Data Collector server can manage the interface, to be able to access the Storage Center systems as well as to be able access the Client on the same network.
155; ;00:19:52,395 --> 00:19:57,360; ;The requirements then for the Data Collector server are these.
156; ;00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:01,499; ;They have to be 64-bit processors with two or more cores.
157; ;00:20:01,499 --> 00:20:04,781; ;So a 32-bit processor is not supported.
158; ;00:20:04,781 --> 00:20:17,113; ;There should be at least 4 gigs of RAM, ideally 8 gigs if you're using the SRA for VMware Site Recovery Manager.
159; ;00:20:17,113 --> 00:20:27,230; ;At least 20 gigs of available storage and could be additional space required to manage the FluidFS cluster during a software upgrade.
160; ;00:20:27,230 --> 00:20:34,264; ;You want at least 20 gigs of storage in this server used as the Data Collector.
161; ;00:20:34,264 --> 00:20:41,593; ;Web browsers that are supported, Internet Explorer 11, Firefox, Chrome, or Microsoft Edge.
162; ;00:20:41,593 --> 00:20:48,744; ;And just like we mentioned with the DSM Client, other browsers might work but are not officially supported.
163; ;00:20:48,744 --> 00:20:57,530; ;.NET 4.0, PowerShell 3.0 or higher, and that's strictly for SMI-S, if you're using SMI-S.
164; ;00:20:57,530 --> 00:21:14,774; ;Supported operating systems, Windows 2008 R2, Windows 2012 and 2012 R2, and as we said, 32-bit OS and Windows Server Core are not supported.
165; ;00:21:14,774 --> 00:21:21,543; ;You're going to have a database typically running on that server.
166; ;00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:24,360; ;So there is an embedded database.
167; ;00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:37,993; ;Ideally, of course, the customers are going to have a database, and those databases are either MySQL 5.5, 5.6, and 5.7 are the current versions supported.
168; ;00:21:37,993 --> 00:21:48,447; ;Microsoft SQL Server 2008 R2, 2012, and 2014, and Microsoft SQL Server Express Edition.
169; ;00:21:48,447 --> 00:21:57,486; ;The versions supported there are 2008 R2 with a 10 gig limit, 2012 and 2014 each with 10 gig limits as well.
170; ;00:21:59,029 --> 00:22:03,893; ;As I mentioned, ideally, the customers are going to have a database.
171; ;00:22:03,893 --> 00:22:09,623; ;However, there is an embedded database that comes with the file system.
172; ;00:22:09,623 --> 00:22:19,177; ;I definitely don't encourage customers to use that, but it's something they can maybe get their feet wet with what kind of data is collected in the Data Collector.
173; ;00:22:19,177 --> 00:22:28,460; ;And that embedded database on the file system holds a maximum of 30 days of data or 64 gigs of data.
174; ;00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:34,162; ;And it's recommended that you see the Dell Storage Manager installation guide for more details.
175; ;00:22:34,162 --> 00:22:39,079; ;There's a lot of good information actually in that DSM installation guide.
1; ;00:00:01,535 --> 00:00:08,372; ;So there were a couple of new items that were released with the Dell Storage Manager 2016 R1.
2; ;00:00:08,372 --> 00:00:10,289; ;We're going to go through those first.
3; ;00:00:10,289 --> 00:00:14,309; ;And then we'll look at DSM 2016 R2.
4; ;00:00:14,309 --> 00:00:18,993; ;Probably most of you will be running DSM 2016 R2.
5; ;00:00:18,993 --> 00:00:27,187; ;When you see these features of DSM 2016 R1, certainly, they'll be included with the R2 release.
6; ;00:00:27,187 --> 00:00:44,594; ;Really the two biggest changes in DSM 2016 R1 revolve around the PS Series, because as of 2016 R1 the day-to-day management of a PS Series is done through the Dell Storage Manager.
7; ;00:00:44,594 --> 00:00:53,441; ;And remember, cross platform replication between PS and SC Series is now done using the DSM interface.
8; ;00:00:53,441 --> 00:00:57,553; ;Those were all changes that were part of 2016 R1.
9; ;00:00:57,553 --> 00:01:08,912; ;Also, any system that was managed prior to DSM 2016 R1 was managed actually by Enterprise Manager.
10; ;00:01:08,912 --> 00:01:14,600; ;So it was this release that triggered the name change as well.
11; ;00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:25,351; ;And the other big thing with DSM 2016 R1 is the Storage Center user interface going away.
12; ;00:01:25,351 --> 00:01:34,804; ;This is a bigger issue certainly for traditional customers who are used to managing the SC Series from that web GUI.
13; ;00:01:34,804 --> 00:01:41,240; ;But for new users, certainly not a big deal because they will not have learned the web GUI at all.
14; ;00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:56,030; ;It does go away starting with DSM 2016 R1, and then from a platform perspective, Storage Center Operating System version 7.0 and higher, the web GUI goes away.
15; ;00:01:56,030 --> 00:02:04,909; ;An error message will display informing the user that the Storage Center user interface is no longer available.
16; ;00:02:04,909 --> 00:02:12,890; ;Now let's look at what's new with the Dell Storage Manager 2016 R2 release of the interface.
17; ;00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:17,224; ;These are the key features of DSM 2016 R2.
18; ;00:02:17,224 --> 00:02:21,379; ;Support for the SC7020.
19; ;00:02:21,379 --> 00:02:30,847; ;Remember that the SC7020 is the solution that allows up to 30 2.5 inch disk drives in a single 3U chassis.
20; ;00:02:30,847 --> 00:02:38,143; ;The DSM supports SC7020 changes to automatically manage disks into disk folders.
21; ;00:02:38,143 --> 00:02:43,090; ;We talk about direct-connect front-end SAS for the SC4020.
22; ;00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:57,526; ;DSM comes into play here because users can configure SAS ports into fault domains in the Storage Center Initial Configuration Wizard or later on from the Dell Storage Management client.
23; ;00:02:57,526 --> 00:03:00,445; ;Live migration of volumes.
24; ;00:03:00,445 --> 00:03:10,628; ;Live migration moves the volume from one Storage Center to another Storage Center without interruption of server communication to the volume.
25; ;00:03:10,628 --> 00:03:16,437; ;Live migration copies a volume to another Storage Center in a federation.
26; ;00:03:16,437 --> 00:03:24,992; ;After copying the volumes, Storage Manager maps the new volume to the server, IO continues uninterrupted from the server to the migrated volume.
27; ;00:03:24,992 --> 00:03:30,081; ;And that's that feature we talked about in the software module called Live Migrate.
28; ;00:03:30,081 --> 00:03:45,607; ;The DSM web user interface, and we'll talk a little bit more about this in the next few slides, the web UI allows a user to monitor, manage, and analyze SC Series systems from that central management console.
29; ;00:03:45,607 --> 00:03:49,699; ;And finally, virtual appliance for the DSM Data Collector.
30; ;00:03:49,699 --> 00:04:03,297; ;Starting with this release, DSM 2016 R2, a user can choose to use a virtual appliance for the data collector obviously if it's in a VMware environment.
31; ;00:04:03,297 --> 00:04:10,018; ;Now let's take our first look at the Dell Storage Manager web user interface or UI.
32; ;00:04:10,018 --> 00:04:22,930; ;The Dell Storage Manager web UI is a web application that allows a user to connect to the Storage Manager Data Collector and centrally manage storage centers.
33; ;00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:32,896; ;The web UI allows a user to monitor, manage, and analyze Storage Centers from a centralized management console.
34; ;00:04:32,896 --> 00:04:40,645; ;The Data Collector stores data it gathers from Storage Centers in an internal or external database, as we talked about earlier.
35; ;00:04:40,645 --> 00:04:48,417; ;The web UI connects to that Data Collector to perform monitoring and administrative tasks.
36; ;00:04:48,417 --> 00:04:51,883; ;So as you look at the Dell Storage Manager, how do you access it?
37; ;00:04:51,883 --> 00:04:54,883; ;We kind of highlighted here, that's kind of difficult to see.
38; ;00:04:54,883 --> 00:04:59,283; ;Accessing the web UI from a browser, you go here.
39; ;00:04:59,283 --> 00:05:09,913; ;Https, we put in the data collector IP address, then following the :33/ui/home.
40; ;00:05:09,913 --> 00:05:11,745; ;That's what's actually in the box here.
41; ;00:05:11,745 --> 00:05:15,260; ;That's what's brings up the Dell Storage Manager interface.
42; ;00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:23,495; ;That's what we mean when we say it's collecting to the Data Collector to perform those monitoring and administrative tasks.
43; ;00:05:23,495 --> 00:05:32,582; ;The supported web browsers are Internet Explorer 10 or later, Firefox, Chrome, and Microsoft Edge.
44; ;00:05:32,582 --> 00:05:40,223; ;And remember, this is the first time that the web UI has been released, and that's with DSM 2016 R2.
45; ;00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:45,033; ;We'll see that in DSM 2016 R2 and greater.
46; ;00:05:45,033 --> 00:05:55,140; ;As far as the login goes, the user can login with their name and password right here, or as an Active Directory or OpenLDAP user.
47; ;00:05:55,140 --> 00:06:04,909; ;If Kerberos authentication is configured, the user can log on automatically using Windows session credentials without typing them in manually.
48; ;00:06:04,909 --> 00:06:09,796; ;So let's take a look at some of the features then of the web UI.
49; ;00:06:09,796 --> 00:06:17,693; ;It's a single user interface for the Data Collector, Dell Storage Manager Client, and Application Protection Manager.
50; ;00:06:17,693 --> 00:06:22,394; ;All those things are managed within that one web UI interface.
51; ;00:06:22,394 --> 00:06:32,291; ;One of the big things for our long-time SC users is written in HTML5, so there's no Java Runtime Environment necessary.
52; ;00:06:32,291 --> 00:06:40,982; ;So you don't have to install a JRE in order to run the web UI because it is run with HTML5.
53; ;00:06:40,982 --> 00:06:45,161; ;I can access it from anywhere from that web browser.
54; ;00:06:45,161 --> 00:06:48,620; ;No separate download, install, or upgrade is required.
55; ;00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:53,065; ;As long as you have that Data Collector IP address, you'll be able to access it.
56; ;00:06:53,065 --> 00:06:55,854; ;And it provides very efficient navigation.
57; ;00:06:55,854 --> 00:06:59,087; ;It's very intuitive as you go through it.
58; ;00:06:59,087 --> 00:07:10,768; ;Now one thing to be aware of, because it is the first release here with DSM 2016 R2, the web UI is definitely not a replacement for the DSM client.
59; ;00:07:10,768 --> 00:07:17,773; ;It does have SC Series data management and monitoring capabilities, but it's not a replacement.
60; ;00:07:17,773 --> 00:07:24,222; ;The initial release of the web UI doesn't have all the functionality of the DSM Client.
61; ;00:07:24,222 --> 00:07:30,188; ;So eventually, future releases are going to have feature parity with the DSM Client.
62; ;00:07:30,188 --> 00:07:35,477; ;And then down the line, we may see this completely replace the DSM Client.
63; ;00:07:35,477 --> 00:07:40,464; ;But certainly, as of right now, use this, get familiar with it.
64; ;00:07:40,464 --> 00:07:44,147; ;But don't consider it a replacement for the DSM Client.
65; ;00:07:44,147 --> 00:07:49,309; ;In a few upcoming slides, we'll show you how intuitive that interface is.
66; ;00:07:49,309 --> 00:07:53,751; ;This is the homepage from the web UI after initial login.
67; ;00:07:53,751 --> 00:08:09,285; ;From here, a user can see a summary of the total storage that is available across all the SC Series systems that are being managed from the Data Collector.
68; ;00:08:09,285 --> 00:08:14,160; ;Remember, we accessed the web UI from the Data Collector IP.
69; ;00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:23,073; ;There you see this total storage summary, this is five Storage Centers being managed, 877 volumes, 95 servers.
70; ;00:08:23,073 --> 00:08:26,685; ;Here's the total space, how much used and how much free.
71; ;00:08:26,685 --> 00:08:30,226; ;So you get a quick storage summary here from the home screen.
72; ;00:08:30,226 --> 00:08:38,860; ;If a user wants to drill down into individual Storage Centers, that's what this area of the homescreen references.
73; ;00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:44,951; ;So you have the health of the Storage Center, so you see all five of the Storage Centers being managed there.
74; ;00:08:44,951 --> 00:08:51,069; ;You see alerts that might be on there, what model does it run, you see all the different models on here.
75; ;00:08:51,069 --> 00:08:57,330; ;8000, Series 40s, 4020s, so all the different models are managed there.
76; ;00:08:57,330 --> 00:09:00,421; ;The number of volumes, number of servers.
77; ;00:09:00,421 --> 00:09:05,578; ;So there's a lot of information that you can see just from the health tab.
78; ;00:09:05,578 --> 00:09:18,636; ;If you take a look within the Storage Center's view, this view from the homescreen, under the Storage tab, you'll see how full are each of these SC Series systems.
79; ;00:09:18,636 --> 00:09:22,232; ;So you get an idea.
80; ;00:09:22,232 --> 00:09:31,617; ;Also, when is the estimation based on the current running rate, when will that system be full?
81; ;00:09:31,617 --> 00:09:35,507; ;So pretty valuable information there for the customers.
82; ;00:09:35,507 --> 00:09:38,619; ;And in the last tab, there's Performance.
83; ;00:09:38,619 --> 00:09:50,075; ;And this gives you an idea, it shows the average read and write IOPS for each SC Series system, you see average reads, average write, and the total IOPS.
84; ;00:09:50,075 --> 00:09:57,795; ;All of that is gathered right here from the Storage Center location on the homepage in the web UI.
85; ;00:09:57,795 --> 00:10:05,267; ;The next view from the homescreen that we'll look at is alerts, down here in the lower left-hand corner.
86; ;00:10:05,267 --> 00:10:18,294; ;This will show you all the alerts that are in all of the systems that are being managed, starting with the most recent alerts as well as the severity of the alert.
87; ;00:10:18,294 --> 00:10:32,574; ;If you click on View All, right there, the screen opens up and you can see all alerts, all the events and logs, all of which are displayed on this screen.
88; ;00:10:32,574 --> 00:10:36,653; ;So you can get even more details about alerts that shows right there.
90; ;00:10:42,017 --> 00:10:48,133; ;The default tab that you see here is by volume growth.
91; ;00:10:48,133 --> 00:10:51,914; ;That's how they're ranked and the tab here is Growth.
92; ;00:10:51,914 --> 00:10:57,612; ;Each volume is ranked based on the amount of the growth per day.
93; ;00:10:57,612 --> 00:11:05,269; ;The Usage tab, which is right here, the Usage tab ranks the volumes based on how full the volume is.
94; ;00:11:05,269 --> 00:11:11,315; ;It also shows the configured space and active space for all those volumes.
95; ;00:11:11,315 --> 00:11:18,903; ;Estimated Full, the next tab over, ranks the volumes based on the date when the volume is estimated to fill up.
96; ;00:11:18,903 --> 00:11:23,832; ;So the Top Volume is the one that's estimated to fill up the soonest.
97; ;00:11:23,832 --> 00:11:30,254; ;You really get a feel for how full your system and how soon it might fill up.
98; ;00:11:30,254 --> 00:11:35,191; ;The Latency tab ranks the volumes.
99; ;00:11:35,191 --> 00:11:36,742; ;We're going through all of these tabs here.
100; ;00:11:36,742 --> 00:11:42,254; ;But the Latency tab ranks the volumes based on which ones have the highest latency.
101; ;00:11:42,254 --> 00:11:45,975; ;The Top Volume has the highest latency.
102; ;00:11:45,975 --> 00:11:52,222; ;It will also show the read and write latency as well.
103; ;00:11:52,222 --> 00:11:59,817; ;And finally, the IOPS tab, right there, ranks the volumes based on which one has the highest IOPS.
104; ;00:11:59,817 --> 00:12:02,581; ;The Top Volume has the most IOPS.
105; ;00:12:02,581 --> 00:12:08,101; ;It also will show you the read and write IOPS.
106; ;00:12:08,101 --> 00:12:18,474; ;There are also two graphs, so that's this tab here, showing you Top Volumes, a lot of great information about the volumes in your environment.
107; ;00:12:18,474 --> 00:12:24,221; ;The Growth is one of the two graphs that display.
89; ;00:10:36,653 --> 00:10:42,017; ;The next area here from the homescreen is called Top Volumes.
108; ;00:12:24,221 --> 00:12:26,099; ;This is what we see here.
109; ;00:12:26,099 --> 00:12:29,098; ;We don't see the performance, but we'll talk about that in a moment.
110; ;00:12:29,098 --> 00:12:41,890; ;So the Growth graph compares all SC Series systems that are being managed from this Data Collector based on growth in gigabytes for those systems in the past week.
111; ;00:12:41,890 --> 00:12:50,006; ;The user has the ability to click on the little wrench icon, kind of see that right there.
112; ;00:12:50,006 --> 00:13:04,417; ;If you click on that little wrench icon, you can change the timeframe from the past week to the past day, the past month, or the past year, depending on what the customer wants to look at.
113; ;00:13:04,417 --> 00:13:08,840; ;There's also an option to add a storage forecast to the graph.
114; ;00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:10,782; ;So that can be pretty powerful.
115; ;00:13:10,782 --> 00:13:17,169; ;The other graph that's on here, and again, that you don't see is a graph called a Performance graph.
116; ;00:13:17,169 --> 00:13:26,822; ;The Performance graph displays the performance of each of the SC systems for the past day based on front-end IOPS.
117; ;00:13:26,822 --> 00:13:44,844; ;And just like in the Growth graph, there's a little wrench icon that can be used to change the performance measurement from megabytes/second to IOPS, it can change timeframe from the past day to the past week or the past month.
118; ;00:13:44,844 --> 00:13:51,469; ;There's a lot of great information just sitting here on the home screen.
119; ;00:13:51,469 --> 00:14:01,525; ;From the home screen, a user can drill down into an individual SC Series system and get a lot more details about that individual system.
120; ;00:14:01,525 --> 00:14:10,897; ;Because from here, there is a hyperlink, that's actually a hyperlink that will allow you to go in and get those details.
121; ;00:14:10,897 --> 00:14:18,609; ;So you can just click on, for example, SC 25 here and go in and get more details about that particular SC system.
122; ;00:14:18,609 --> 00:14:22,206; ;From looking here, we notice that it's an SC 8000.
123; ;00:14:22,206 --> 00:14:30,798; ;We see the service tag and we see the serial number just by looking, very obviously at a glance.
124; ;00:14:30,798 --> 00:14:35,750; ;There are tabs across the top here that will give us some more details.
125; ;00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:40,197; ;Certainly, you can click on any of those and get some more details about that.
126; ;00:14:40,197 --> 00:14:42,875; ;They're all hyperlinked together.
127; ;00:14:42,875 --> 00:14:53,838; ;And this is what we said earlier by this being very intuitive, you can just go on the screen and do some clicking and start to get more details about different things.
128; ;00:14:53,838 --> 00:15:04,045; ;Down in the Top Volumes box, for example, you can click on this volume here, this again is a hyperlink.
129; ;00:15:04,045 --> 00:15:11,930; ;If you click on that Top Volume, you'll get more details about that particular volume.
130; ;00:15:11,930 --> 00:15:17,682; ;If I click on it, here I get that volume and then details of that volume.
131; ;00:15:17,682 --> 00:15:25,444; ;This is the volume itself, this is the configured space, this is how much disk is used by this volume.
132; ;00:15:25,444 --> 00:15:27,536; ;I see the volume growth.
133; ;00:15:27,536 --> 00:15:31,799; ;I have a handful of tabs that can come into play.
134; ;00:15:31,799 --> 00:15:41,524; ;This is just a summary tab, but I can look and see what server is this volume mapped to, what servers, potentially.
135; ;00:15:41,524 --> 00:15:50,408; ;Snapshots, I can take a look at all the different snapshots that I've taken, when they expire, when I can use those, I can look at threshold alerts.
136; ;00:15:50,408 --> 00:15:53,776; ;I can look at tiering.
137; ;00:15:53,776 --> 00:16:00,136; ;Tiering will tell me what tiers and RAID types belong to this volume.
138; ;00:16:00,136 --> 00:16:09,417; ;Where is this volume located in the array as far as is it on tier 1, is there parts of this volume on tier 2, or 3.
139; ;00:16:09,417 --> 00:16:16,644; ;There's really a lot of great things, not to mention Growth and Performance graphs, just for this individual volume.
140; ;00:16:16,644 --> 00:16:25,904; ;Great information about any individual volume and it's very easy to access that volume using the hyperlinks.
141; ;00:16:25,904 --> 00:16:29,306; ;As we said, the web UI is not just for monitoring.
142; ;00:16:29,306 --> 00:16:38,602; ;The home screen is a great place to look at the overall health, what if a user wants to create new volumes or wants to edit existing volumes?
143; ;00:16:38,602 --> 00:16:40,251; ;That can all be done from here.
144; ;00:16:40,251 --> 00:16:52,384; ;From the homepage, I can click on the dropdown there at Dell Storage Manager and I can choose either Storage, SC Series, or Volumes.
145; ;00:16:52,384 --> 00:16:57,267; ;Depending on which I choose, I can add a Storage Center potentially from here.
146; ;00:16:57,267 --> 00:16:59,553; ;But let's say I want to add a volume.
147; ;00:16:59,553 --> 00:17:10,712; ;I highlight the Volumes options and then I will get a list of my existing volumes that are in the whole array.
148; ;00:17:10,712 --> 00:17:15,444; ;And starting here with SC 4, I will see that list.
149; ;00:17:15,444 --> 00:17:19,963; ;I can create a new volume from here if I want to.
150; ;00:17:19,963 --> 00:17:26,018; ;I can edit an existing volume, I can move a volume, I can delete a volume.
151; ;00:17:26,018 --> 00:17:28,861; ;And then there are some other options as well.
152; ;00:17:28,861 --> 00:17:34,478; ;Under the More Actions tab, I can map up a volume to a server if it's not mapped.
153; ;00:17:34,478 --> 00:17:38,937; ;This is where I can create a snapshot for the volume.
154; ;00:17:38,937 --> 00:17:42,913; ;We show you here, copy, mirror, migrate a volume.
155; ;00:17:42,913 --> 00:17:49,175; ;Also, snapshot profiles, storage profiles, thresholds can be set here for an individual volume.
156; ;00:17:49,175 --> 00:17:54,820; ;There's a lot of functionality built in from the Volumes page.
157; ;00:17:54,820 --> 00:18:03,153; ;I would encourage you if you have DSM 2016 R2 to play around a little bit in the web UI.
158; ;00:18:03,153 --> 00:18:20,082; ;I think you'll find it very easy to work with, even though it doesn't have the full functionality of the DSM Client, there's a lot of great features and a lot of great views in here that, frankly, we haven't had before.
159; ;00:18:20,082 --> 00:18:34,819; ;Depending on the type or user that is going to be using the web UI, there's a few different use cases depending if you're an IT generalist, a storage specialist, or just like an enterprise orchestrator.
160; ;00:18:34,819 --> 00:18:45,162; ;For the IT generalist, very simple to use, that single UI, you can get at it from anywhere, and very intuitive with lots of hyperlinks.
161; ;00:18:45,162 --> 00:18:47,525; ;It's a quick, clean interface.
162; ;00:18:47,525 --> 00:18:55,132; ;For a specialist, a storage specialist in particular, it's really perfect for that mid-level storage administrator.
163; ;00:18:55,132 --> 00:19:07,881; ;You can customize the dashboards, very quick response, really a good fit with a virtualized appliance, which we'll be talking about next, the DSM Data Collector.
164; ;00:19:07,881 --> 00:19:14,165; ;And then from an enterprise orchestrator point of view they typically don't use UI tools.
165; ;00:19:14,165 --> 00:19:20,929; ;They have the functionality of RESTful APIs they can utilize for massive scripting and automation.
166; ;00:19:20,929 --> 00:19:23,506; ;And they can use the web UI for quick monitoring checks.
167; ;00:19:23,506 --> 00:19:32,189; ;Because it is so intuitive, they can quickly learn and quickly function moving around the web UI.
168; ;00:19:32,189 --> 00:19:41,806; ;With the release of DSM 2016, and it actually came out in R1, came the introduction of a virtual appliance option for a DSM.
169; ;00:19:41,806 --> 00:19:48,869; ;There's no longer a need to stand up a physical Windows host for DSM management.
170; ;00:19:48,869 --> 00:19:55,479; ;The virtual appliance is a VMware Open Virtual Appliance, or OVA.
171; ;00:19:55,479 --> 00:20:00,487; ;It can run on Linux, CentOS 7.x, as well as Windows.
172; ;00:20:00,487 --> 00:20:06,628; ;It's the same management user interface whether it's an OVA or it's run from a physical Windows box.
173; ;00:20:06,628 --> 00:20:09,364; ;It's going to be the same interface.
174; ;00:20:09,364 --> 00:20:12,453; ;The Windows physical server install is still going to be there.
175; ;00:20:12,453 --> 00:20:18,152; ;So that's still going to be an option if that's something that a customer needs.
176; ;00:20:18,152 --> 00:20:21,505; ;It's very simple installation and deployment.
177; ;00:20:21,505 --> 00:20:23,165; ;That's the thing that's great about it.
178; ;00:20:23,165 --> 00:20:26,719; ;It's packaged as a virtual machine, so it's easy for the customer.
179; ;00:20:26,719 --> 00:20:31,999; ;It comes preinstalled and preconfigured with the application stack.
180; ;00:20:31,999 --> 00:20:41,867; ;The SC historical stats can be stored on the Open Virtual Appliance itself on an internal database or on an existing external database.
181; ;00:20:41,867 --> 00:20:50,750; ;And it's a pretty easy migration if you wanted to go from a physical Windows server to an Open Virtual Appliance in VMware.
182; ;00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:55,089; ;Let's go through a few review questions on the material we just covered.
183; ;00:20:55,089 --> 00:21:02,843; ;Our first one, what type of Dell Storage Manager interface does not use Java and can be accessed from a browser?
184; ;00:21:02,843 --> 00:21:04,677; ;We spent most of our time talking about that, right?
185; ;00:21:04,677 --> 00:21:06,790; ;So I assume everybody will get that one.
186; ;00:21:06,790 --> 00:21:09,538; ;That's the DSM web UI.
187; ;00:21:09,538 --> 00:21:11,584; ;Okay, good.
188; ;00:21:11,584 --> 00:21:19,737; ;What's the minimum SCOS version required to directly connect from a Dell Storage Client to a Storage Center?
189; ;00:21:19,737 --> 00:21:21,949; ;You remember which version that was?
190; ;00:21:21,949 --> 00:21:26,114; ;We talked about a lot of different versions but SCOS 6.6.
191; ;00:21:26,114 --> 00:21:27,447; ;Good.
192; ;00:21:27,447 --> 00:21:33,680; ;And then finally, the Data Collector server can run on what platforms?
193; ;00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:34,970; ;Server, right?
194; ;00:21:34,970 --> 00:21:40,680; ;So it's Windows Server or now the DSM Virtual Appliance.
195; ;00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:41,757; ;Good.
1; ;00:00:01,535 --> 00:00:08,372; ;So there were a couple of new items that were released with the Dell Storage Manager 2016 R1.
2; ;00:00:08,372 --> 00:00:10,289; ;We're going to go through those first.
3; ;00:00:10,289 --> 00:00:14,309; ;And then we'll look at DSM 2016 R2.
4; ;00:00:14,309 --> 00:00:18,993; ;Probably most of you will be running DSM 2016 R2.
5; ;00:00:18,993 --> 00:00:27,187; ;When you see these features of DSM 2016 R1, certainly, they'll be included with the R2 release.
6; ;00:00:27,187 --> 00:00:44,594; ;Really the two biggest changes in DSM 2016 R1 revolve around the PS Series, because as of 2016 R1 the day-to-day management of a PS Series is done through the Dell Storage Manager.
7; ;00:00:44,594 --> 00:00:53,441; ;And remember, cross platform replication between PS and SC Series is now done using the DSM interface.
8; ;00:00:53,441 --> 00:00:57,553; ;Those were all changes that were part of 2016 R1.
9; ;00:00:57,553 --> 00:01:08,912; ;Also, any system that was managed prior to DSM 2016 R1 was managed actually by Enterprise Manager.
10; ;00:01:08,912 --> 00:01:14,600; ;So it was this release that triggered the name change as well.
11; ;00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:25,351; ;And the other big thing with DSM 2016 R1 is the Storage Center user interface going away.
12; ;00:01:25,351 --> 00:01:34,804; ;This is a bigger issue certainly for traditional customers who are used to managing the SC Series from that web GUI.
13; ;00:01:34,804 --> 00:01:41,240; ;But for new users, certainly not a big deal because they will not have learned the web GUI at all.
14; ;00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:56,030; ;It does go away starting with DSM 2016 R1, and then from a platform perspective, Storage Center Operating System version 7.0 and higher, the web GUI goes away.
15; ;00:01:56,030 --> 00:02:04,909; ;An error message will display informing the user that the Storage Center user interface is no longer available.
16; ;00:02:04,909 --> 00:02:12,890; ;Now let's look at what's new with the Dell Storage Manager 2016 R2 release of the interface.
17; ;00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:17,224; ;These are the key features of DSM 2016 R2.
18; ;00:02:17,224 --> 00:02:21,379; ;Support for the SC7020.
19; ;00:02:21,379 --> 00:02:30,847; ;Remember that the SC7020 is the solution that allows up to 30 2.5 inch disk drives in a single 3U chassis.
20; ;00:02:30,847 --> 00:02:38,143; ;The DSM supports SC7020 changes to automatically manage disks into disk folders.
21; ;00:02:38,143 --> 00:02:43,090; ;We talk about direct-connect front-end SAS for the SC4020.
22; ;00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:57,526; ;DSM comes into play here because users can configure SAS ports into fault domains in the Storage Center Initial Configuration Wizard or later on from the Dell Storage Management client.
23; ;00:02:57,526 --> 00:03:00,445; ;Live migration of volumes.
24; ;00:03:00,445 --> 00:03:10,628; ;Live migration moves the volume from one Storage Center to another Storage Center without interruption of server communication to the volume.
25; ;00:03:10,628 --> 00:03:16,437; ;Live migration copies a volume to another Storage Center in a federation.
26; ;00:03:16,437 --> 00:03:24,992; ;After copying the volumes, Storage Manager maps the new volume to the server, IO continues uninterrupted from the server to the migrated volume.
27; ;00:03:24,992 --> 00:03:30,081; ;And that's that feature we talked about in the software module called Live Migrate.
28; ;00:03:30,081 --> 00:03:45,607; ;The DSM web user interface, and we'll talk a little bit more about this in the next few slides, the web UI allows a user to monitor, manage, and analyze SC Series systems from that central management console.
29; ;00:03:45,607 --> 00:03:49,699; ;And finally, virtual appliance for the DSM Data Collector.
30; ;00:03:49,699 --> 00:04:03,297; ;Starting with this release, DSM 2016 R2, a user can choose to use a virtual appliance for the data collector obviously if it's in a VMware environment.
31; ;00:04:03,297 --> 00:04:10,018; ;Now let's take our first look at the Dell Storage Manager web user interface or UI.
32; ;00:04:10,018 --> 00:04:22,930; ;The Dell Storage Manager web UI is a web application that allows a user to connect to the Storage Manager Data Collector and centrally manage storage centers.
33; ;00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:32,896; ;The web UI allows a user to monitor, manage, and analyze Storage Centers from a centralized management console.
34; ;00:04:32,896 --> 00:04:40,645; ;The Data Collector stores data it gathers from Storage Centers in an internal or external database, as we talked about earlier.
35; ;00:04:40,645 --> 00:04:48,417; ;The web UI connects to that Data Collector to perform monitoring and administrative tasks.
36; ;00:04:48,417 --> 00:04:51,883; ;So as you look at the Dell Storage Manager, how do you access it?
37; ;00:04:51,883 --> 00:04:54,883; ;We kind of highlighted here, that's kind of difficult to see.
38; ;00:04:54,883 --> 00:04:59,283; ;Accessing the web UI from a browser, you go here.
39; ;00:04:59,283 --> 00:05:09,913; ;Https, we put in the data collector IP address, then following the :33/ui/home.
40; ;00:05:09,913 --> 00:05:11,745; ;That's what's actually in the box here.
41; ;00:05:11,745 --> 00:05:15,260; ;That's what's brings up the Dell Storage Manager interface.
42; ;00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:23,495; ;That's what we mean when we say it's collecting to the Data Collector to perform those monitoring and administrative tasks.
43; ;00:05:23,495 --> 00:05:32,582; ;The supported web browsers are Internet Explorer 10 or later, Firefox, Chrome, and Microsoft Edge.
44; ;00:05:32,582 --> 00:05:40,223; ;And remember, this is the first time that the web UI has been released, and that's with DSM 2016 R2.
45; ;00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:45,033; ;We'll see that in DSM 2016 R2 and greater.
46; ;00:05:45,033 --> 00:05:55,140; ;As far as the login goes, the user can login with their name and password right here, or as an Active Directory or OpenLDAP user.
47; ;00:05:55,140 --> 00:06:04,909; ;If Kerberos authentication is configured, the user can log on automatically using Windows session credentials without typing them in manually.
48; ;00:06:04,909 --> 00:06:09,796; ;So let's take a look at some of the features then of the web UI.
49; ;00:06:09,796 --> 00:06:17,693; ;It's a single user interface for the Data Collector, Dell Storage Manager Client, and Application Protection Manager.
50; ;00:06:17,693 --> 00:06:22,394; ;All those things are managed within that one web UI interface.
51; ;00:06:22,394 --> 00:06:32,291; ;One of the big things for our long-time SC users is written in HTML5, so there's no Java Runtime Environment necessary.
52; ;00:06:32,291 --> 00:06:40,982; ;So you don't have to install a JRE in order to run the web UI because it is run with HTML5.
53; ;00:06:40,982 --> 00:06:45,161; ;I can access it from anywhere from that web browser.
54; ;00:06:45,161 --> 00:06:48,620; ;No separate download, install, or upgrade is required.
55; ;00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:53,065; ;As long as you have that Data Collector IP address, you'll be able to access it.
56; ;00:06:53,065 --> 00:06:55,854; ;And it provides very efficient navigation.
57; ;00:06:55,854 --> 00:06:59,087; ;It's very intuitive as you go through it.
58; ;00:06:59,087 --> 00:07:10,768; ;Now one thing to be aware of, because it is the first release here with DSM 2016 R2, the web UI is definitely not a replacement for the DSM client.
59; ;00:07:10,768 --> 00:07:17,773; ;It does have SC Series data management and monitoring capabilities, but it's not a replacement.
60; ;00:07:17,773 --> 00:07:24,222; ;The initial release of the web UI doesn't have all the functionality of the DSM Client.
61; ;00:07:24,222 --> 00:07:30,188; ;So eventually, future releases are going to have feature parity with the DSM Client.
62; ;00:07:30,188 --> 00:07:35,477; ;And then down the line, we may see this completely replace the DSM Client.
63; ;00:07:35,477 --> 00:07:40,464; ;But certainly, as of right now, use this, get familiar with it.
64; ;00:07:40,464 --> 00:07:44,147; ;But don't consider it a replacement for the DSM Client.
65; ;00:07:44,147 --> 00:07:49,309; ;In a few upcoming slides, we'll show you how intuitive that interface is.
66; ;00:07:49,309 --> 00:07:53,751; ;This is the homepage from the web UI after initial login.
67; ;00:07:53,751 --> 00:08:09,285; ;From here, a user can see a summary of the total storage that is available across all the SC Series systems that are being managed from the Data Collector.
68; ;00:08:09,285 --> 00:08:14,160; ;Remember, we accessed the web UI from the Data Collector IP.
69; ;00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:23,073; ;There you see this total storage summary, this is five Storage Centers being managed, 877 volumes, 95 servers.
70; ;00:08:23,073 --> 00:08:26,685; ;Here's the total space, how much used and how much free.
71; ;00:08:26,685 --> 00:08:30,226; ;So you get a quick storage summary here from the home screen.
72; ;00:08:30,226 --> 00:08:38,860; ;If a user wants to drill down into individual Storage Centers, that's what this area of the homescreen references.
73; ;00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:44,951; ;So you have the health of the Storage Center, so you see all five of the Storage Centers being managed there.
74; ;00:08:44,951 --> 00:08:51,069; ;You see alerts that might be on there, what model does it run, you see all the different models on here.
75; ;00:08:51,069 --> 00:08:57,330; ;8000, Series 40s, 4020s, so all the different models are managed there.
76; ;00:08:57,330 --> 00:09:00,421; ;The number of volumes, number of servers.
77; ;00:09:00,421 --> 00:09:05,578; ;So there's a lot of information that you can see just from the health tab.
78; ;00:09:05,578 --> 00:09:18,636; ;If you take a look within the Storage Center's view, this view from the homescreen, under the Storage tab, you'll see how full are each of these SC Series systems.
79; ;00:09:18,636 --> 00:09:22,232; ;So you get an idea.
80; ;00:09:22,232 --> 00:09:31,617; ;Also, when is the estimation based on the current running rate, when will that system be full?
81; ;00:09:31,617 --> 00:09:35,507; ;So pretty valuable information there for the customers.
82; ;00:09:35,507 --> 00:09:38,619; ;And in the last tab, there's Performance.
83; ;00:09:38,619 --> 00:09:50,075; ;And this gives you an idea, it shows the average read and write IOPS for each SC Series system, you see average reads, average write, and the total IOPS.
84; ;00:09:50,075 --> 00:09:57,795; ;All of that is gathered right here from the Storage Center location on the homepage in the web UI.
85; ;00:09:57,795 --> 00:10:05,267; ;The next view from the homescreen that we'll look at is alerts, down here in the lower left-hand corner.
86; ;00:10:05,267 --> 00:10:18,294; ;This will show you all the alerts that are in all of the systems that are being managed, starting with the most recent alerts as well as the severity of the alert.
87; ;00:10:18,294 --> 00:10:32,574; ;If you click on View All, right there, the screen opens up and you can see all alerts, all the events and logs, all of which are displayed on this screen.
88; ;00:10:32,574 --> 00:10:36,653; ;So you can get even more details about alerts that shows right there.
89; ;00:10:36,653 --> 00:10:42,017; ;The next area here from the homescreen is called Top Volumes.
90; ;00:10:42,017 --> 00:10:48,133; ;The default tab that you see here is by volume growth.
91; ;00:10:48,133 --> 00:10:51,914; ;That's how they're ranked and the tab here is Growth.
92; ;00:10:51,914 --> 00:10:57,612; ;Each volume is ranked based on the amount of the growth per day.
93; ;00:10:57,612 --> 00:11:05,269; ;The Usage tab, which is right here, the Usage tab ranks the volumes based on how full the volume is.
94; ;00:11:05,269 --> 00:11:11,315; ;It also shows the configured space and active space for all those volumes.
95; ;00:11:11,315 --> 00:11:18,903; ;Estimated Full, the next tab over, ranks the volumes based on the date when the volume is estimated to fill up.
96; ;00:11:18,903 --> 00:11:23,832; ;So the Top Volume is the one that's estimated to fill up the soonest.
97; ;00:11:23,832 --> 00:11:30,254; ;You really get a feel for how full your system and how soon it might fill up.
98; ;00:11:30,254 --> 00:11:35,191; ;The Latency tab ranks the volumes.
99; ;00:11:35,191 --> 00:11:36,742; ;We're going through all of these tabs here.
100; ;00:11:36,742 --> 00:11:42,254; ;But the Latency tab ranks the volumes based on which ones have the highest latency.
101; ;00:11:42,254 --> 00:11:45,975; ;The Top Volume has the highest latency.
102; ;00:11:45,975 --> 00:11:52,222; ;It will also show the read and write latency as well.
103; ;00:11:52,222 --> 00:11:59,817; ;And finally, the IOPS tab, right there, ranks the volumes based on which one has the highest IOPS.
104; ;00:11:59,817 --> 00:12:02,581; ;The Top Volume has the most IOPS.
105; ;00:12:02,581 --> 00:12:08,101; ;It also will show you the read and write IOPS.
106; ;00:12:08,101 --> 00:12:18,474; ;There are also two graphs, so that's this tab here, showing you Top Volumes, a lot of great information about the volumes in your environment.
107; ;00:12:18,474 --> 00:12:24,221; ;The Growth is one of the two graphs that display.
108; ;00:12:24,221 --> 00:12:26,099; ;This is what we see here.
109; ;00:12:26,099 --> 00:12:29,098; ;We don't see the performance, but we'll talk about that in a moment.
110; ;00:12:29,098 --> 00:12:41,890; ;So the Growth graph compares all SC Series systems that are being managed from this Data Collector based on growth in gigabytes for those systems in the past week.
111; ;00:12:41,890 --> 00:12:50,006; ;The user has the ability to click on the little wrench icon, kind of see that right there.
112; ;00:12:50,006 --> 00:13:04,417; ;If you click on that little wrench icon, you can change the timeframe from the past week to the past day, the past month, or the past year, depending on what the customer wants to look at.
113; ;00:13:04,417 --> 00:13:08,840; ;There's also an option to add a storage forecast to the graph.
114; ;00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:10,782; ;So that can be pretty powerful.
115; ;00:13:10,782 --> 00:13:17,169; ;The other graph that's on here, and again, that you don't see is a graph called a Performance graph.
116; ;00:13:17,169 --> 00:13:26,822; ;The Performance graph displays the performance of each of the SC systems for the past day based on front-end IOPS.
117; ;00:13:26,822 --> 00:13:44,844; ;And just like in the Growth graph, there's a little wrench icon that can be used to change the performance measurement from megabytes/second to IOPS, it can change timeframe from the past day to the past week or the past month.
118; ;00:13:44,844 --> 00:13:51,469; ;There's a lot of great information just sitting here on the home screen.
119; ;00:13:51,469 --> 00:14:01,525; ;From the home screen, a user can drill down into an individual SC Series system and get a lot more details about that individual system.
120; ;00:14:01,525 --> 00:14:10,897; ;Because from here, there is a hyperlink, that's actually a hyperlink that will allow you to go in and get those details.
121; ;00:14:10,897 --> 00:14:18,609; ;So you can just click on, for example, SC 25 here and go in and get more details about that particular SC system.
122; ;00:14:18,609 --> 00:14:22,206; ;From looking here, we notice that it's an SC 8000.
123; ;00:14:22,206 --> 00:14:30,798; ;We see the service tag and we see the serial number just by looking, very obviously at a glance.
124; ;00:14:30,798 --> 00:14:35,750; ;There are tabs across the top here that will give us some more details.
125; ;00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:40,197; ;Certainly, you can click on any of those and get some more details about that.
126; ;00:14:40,197 --> 00:14:42,875; ;They're all hyperlinked together.
127; ;00:14:42,875 --> 00:14:53,838; ;And this is what we said earlier by this being very intuitive, you can just go on the screen and do some clicking and start to get more details about different things.
128; ;00:14:53,838 --> 00:15:04,045; ;Down in the Top Volumes box, for example, you can click on this volume here, this again is a hyperlink.
129; ;00:15:04,045 --> 00:15:11,930; ;If you click on that Top Volume, you'll get more details about that particular volume.
130; ;00:15:11,930 --> 00:15:17,682; ;If I click on it, here I get that volume and then details of that volume.
131; ;00:15:17,682 --> 00:15:25,444; ;This is the volume itself, this is the configured space, this is how much disk is used by this volume.
132; ;00:15:25,444 --> 00:15:27,536; ;I see the volume growth.
133; ;00:15:27,536 --> 00:15:31,799; ;I have a handful of tabs that can come into play.
134; ;00:15:31,799 --> 00:15:41,524; ;This is just a summary tab, but I can look and see what server is this volume mapped to, what servers, potentially.
135; ;00:15:41,524 --> 00:15:50,408; ;Snapshots, I can take a look at all the different snapshots that I've taken, when they expire, when I can use those, I can look at threshold alerts.
136; ;00:15:50,408 --> 00:15:53,776; ;I can look at tiering.
137; ;00:15:53,776 --> 00:16:00,136; ;Tiering will tell me what tiers and RAID types belong to this volume.
138; ;00:16:00,136 --> 00:16:09,417; ;Where is this volume located in the array as far as is it on tier 1, is there parts of this volume on tier 2, or 3.
139; ;00:16:09,417 --> 00:16:16,644; ;There's really a lot of great things, not to mention Growth and Performance graphs, just for this individual volume.
140; ;00:16:16,644 --> 00:16:25,904; ;Great information about any individual volume and it's very easy to access that volume using the hyperlinks.
141; ;00:16:25,904 --> 00:16:29,306; ;As we said, the web UI is not just for monitoring.
142; ;00:16:29,306 --> 00:16:38,602; ;The home screen is a great place to look at the overall health, what if a user wants to create new volumes or wants to edit existing volumes?
143; ;00:16:38,602 --> 00:16:40,251; ;That can all be done from here.
144; ;00:16:40,251 --> 00:16:52,384; ;From the homepage, I can click on the dropdown there at Dell Storage Manager and I can choose either Storage, SC Series, or Volumes.
145; ;00:16:52,384 --> 00:16:57,267; ;Depending on which I choose, I can add a Storage Center potentially from here.
146; ;00:16:57,267 --> 00:16:59,553; ;But let's say I want to add a volume.
147; ;00:16:59,553 --> 00:17:10,712; ;I highlight the Volumes options and then I will get a list of my existing volumes that are in the whole array.
148; ;00:17:10,712 --> 00:17:15,444; ;And starting here with SC 4, I will see that list.
149; ;00:17:15,444 --> 00:17:19,963; ;I can create a new volume from here if I want to.
150; ;00:17:19,963 --> 00:17:26,018; ;I can edit an existing volume, I can move a volume, I can delete a volume.
151; ;00:17:26,018 --> 00:17:28,861; ;And then there are some other options as well.
152; ;00:17:28,861 --> 00:17:34,478; ;Under the More Actions tab, I can map up a volume to a server if it's not mapped.
153; ;00:17:34,478 --> 00:17:38,937; ;This is where I can create a snapshot for the volume.
154; ;00:17:38,937 --> 00:17:42,913; ;We show you here, copy, mirror, migrate a volume.
155; ;00:17:42,913 --> 00:17:49,175; ;Also, snapshot profiles, storage profiles, thresholds can be set here for an individual volume.
156; ;00:17:49,175 --> 00:17:54,820; ;There's a lot of functionality built in from the Volumes page.
157; ;00:17:54,820 --> 00:18:03,153; ;I would encourage you if you have DSM 2016 R2 to play around a little bit in the web UI.
158; ;00:18:03,153 --> 00:18:20,082; ;I think you'll find it very easy to work with, even though it doesn't have the full functionality of the DSM Client, there's a lot of great features and a lot of great views in here that, frankly, we haven't had before.
159; ;00:18:20,082 --> 00:18:34,819; ;Depending on the type or user that is going to be using the web UI, there's a few different use cases depending if you're an IT generalist, a storage specialist, or just like an enterprise orchestrator.
160; ;00:18:34,819 --> 00:18:45,162; ;For the IT generalist, very simple to use, that single UI, you can get at it from anywhere, and very intuitive with lots of hyperlinks.
161; ;00:18:45,162 --> 00:18:47,525; ;It's a quick, clean interface.
162; ;00:18:47,525 --> 00:18:55,132; ;For a specialist, a storage specialist in particular, it's really perfect for that mid-level storage administrator.
163; ;00:18:55,132 --> 00:19:07,881; ;You can customize the dashboards, very quick response, really a good fit with a virtualized appliance, which we'll be talking about next, the DSM Data Collector.
164; ;00:19:07,881 --> 00:19:14,165; ;And then from an enterprise orchestrator point of view they typically don't use UI tools.
165; ;00:19:14,165 --> 00:19:20,929; ;They have the functionality of RESTful APIs they can utilize for massive scripting and automation.
166; ;00:19:20,929 --> 00:19:23,506; ;And they can use the web UI for quick monitoring checks.
167; ;00:19:23,506 --> 00:19:32,189; ;Because it is so intuitive, they can quickly learn and quickly function moving around the web UI.
168; ;00:19:32,189 --> 00:19:41,806; ;With the release of DSM 2016, and it actually came out in R1, came the introduction of a virtual appliance option for a DSM.
169; ;00:19:41,806 --> 00:19:48,869; ;There's no longer a need to stand up a physical Windows host for DSM management.
170; ;00:19:48,869 --> 00:19:55,479; ;The virtual appliance is a VMware Open Virtual Appliance, or OVA.
171; ;00:19:55,479 --> 00:20:00,487; ;It can run on Linux, CentOS 7.x, as well as Windows.
172; ;00:20:00,487 --> 00:20:06,628; ;It's the same management user interface whether it's an OVA or it's run from a physical Windows box.
173; ;00:20:06,628 --> 00:20:09,364; ;It's going to be the same interface.
174; ;00:20:09,364 --> 00:20:12,453; ;The Windows physical server install is still going to be there.
175; ;00:20:12,453 --> 00:20:18,152; ;So that's still going to be an option if that's something that a customer needs.
176; ;00:20:18,152 --> 00:20:21,505; ;It's very simple installation and deployment.
177; ;00:20:21,505 --> 00:20:23,165; ;That's the thing that's great about it.
178; ;00:20:23,165 --> 00:20:26,719; ;It's packaged as a virtual machine, so it's easy for the customer.
179; ;00:20:26,719 --> 00:20:31,999; ;It comes preinstalled and preconfigured with the application stack.
180; ;00:20:31,999 --> 00:20:41,867; ;The SC historical stats can be stored on the Open Virtual Appliance itself on an internal database or on an existing external database.
181; ;00:20:41,867 --> 00:20:50,750; ;And it's a pretty easy migration if you wanted to go from a physical Windows server to an Open Virtual Appliance in VMware.
182; ;00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:55,089; ;Let's go through a few review questions on the material we just covered.
183; ;00:20:55,089 --> 00:21:02,843; ;Our first one, what type of Dell Storage Manager interface does not use Java and can be accessed from a browser?
184; ;00:21:02,843 --> 00:21:04,677; ;We spent most of our time talking about that, right?
185; ;00:21:04,677 --> 00:21:06,790; ;So I assume everybody will get that one.
186; ;00:21:06,790 --> 00:21:09,538; ;That's the DSM web UI.
187; ;00:21:09,538 --> 00:21:11,584; ;Okay, good.
188; ;00:21:11,584 --> 00:21:19,737; ;What's the minimum SCOS version required to directly connect from a Dell Storage Client to a Storage Center?
189; ;00:21:19,737 --> 00:21:21,949; ;You remember which version that was?
190; ;00:21:21,949 --> 00:21:26,114; ;We talked about a lot of different versions but SCOS 6.6.
191; ;00:21:26,114 --> 00:21:27,447; ;Good.
192; ;00:21:27,447 --> 00:21:33,680; ;And then finally, the Data Collector server can run on what platforms?
193; ;00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:34,970; ;Server, right?
194; ;00:21:34,970 --> 00:21:40,680; ;So it's Windows Server or now the DSM Virtual Appliance.
195; ;00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:41,757; ;Good.
1; ;00:00:01,098 --> 00:00:07,450; ;Let's take a look at some management options that are available now from the Dell Storage Client.
2; ;00:00:10,008 --> 00:00:13,655; ;Let's start in this section with a discussion question.
3; ;00:00:13,655 --> 00:00:17,289; ;Where is the DSM Storage Client installed from?
4; ;00:00:18,732 --> 00:00:23,454; ;We're going to answer this coming up here, but if anybody knows now.
5; ;00:00:23,454 --> 00:00:26,893; ;From the Data Collector interface.
6; ;00:00:26,893 --> 00:00:32,877; ;Once you have the Data Collector downloaded, you can install the client from that interface.
7; ;00:00:32,877 --> 00:00:38,539; ;We'll be talking a little bit more about that as we start going through the next few slides.
8; ;00:00:38,539 --> 00:00:44,517; ;In this slide, we're going to talk about installing the DSM Storage Client.
9; ;00:00:44,517 --> 00:00:57,742; ;And we'll go through these specifics of it in a moment, but be aware that you are going to install the client from the Dell Storage Manager Data Collector that you see here.
10; ;00:00:57,742 --> 00:01:05,208; ;One question, of course, we get is "Well, how do you install the Data Collector?"
11; ;00:01:05,208 --> 00:01:16,457; ;Currently, as of this recording, the Data Collector can be downloaded from the Dell Compellent's Knowledge Center.
12; ;00:01:16,457 --> 00:01:22,871; ;But you want to make sure and contact the Technical Support team if you're not sure.
13; ;00:01:25,383 --> 00:01:29,203; ;They can fill you in on where to get that Data Collector.
14; ;00:01:29,203 --> 00:01:38,745; ;Here we've got the Data Collector installed, we just go ahead and we double click on the Data Collector to open it up, okay, the Data Collector icon.
15; ;00:01:38,745 --> 00:01:45,658; ;We'll then choose the Go to Website option, and it will bring up the screen that we see here.
16; ;00:01:45,658 --> 00:01:49,980; ;It opens up the Storage Manager Applications window.
17; ;00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:58,621; ;Here's where an administrator can download and install the DSM client for either Windows or Linux, depending on which one you have.
18; ;00:01:58,621 --> 00:02:04,159; ;This is also where you can download the Windows server agent if that's what you require.
19; ;00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:10,378; ;There are also administrator guides, there are three different administrator guides that you can download from here.
20; ;00:02:10,378 --> 00:02:17,042; ;There is the Storage Center Administrator Guide, which focuses really on the Storage Center client only.
21; ;00:02:17,042 --> 00:02:24,398; ;There's the Administrator Guide which includes the full DSM application, not just the client.
22; ;00:02:24,398 --> 00:02:31,530; ;And there's the Web UI Administrator Guide, which is strictly focused on that Web UI that we talked about earlier.
23; ;00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:36,004; ;Finally, you can download the Application Protection Manager packages from here.
24; ;00:02:36,004 --> 00:02:44,922; ;This would include Replay Manager for Windows SQL Server as well as the Application Protection Manager for Oracle Linux.
25; ;00:02:44,922 --> 00:02:48,807; ;Once you've downloaded the Dell Storage Client, how do you go into it?
26; ;00:02:48,807 --> 00:02:56,862; ;Well, you just double click on the desktop icon that opens up the Storage Manager Client and then the home screen appears.
27; ;00:02:56,862 --> 00:02:59,092; ;This is the screen that you'll see.
28; ;00:02:59,092 --> 00:03:01,668; ;There are four different options here.
29; ;00:03:01,668 --> 00:03:13,185; ;You can discover and configure uninitialized SCv2000 or SC7000 series Storage Centers.
30; ;00:03:13,185 --> 00:03:21,164; ;This is what you're going to do if you're going to begin the install process for either an SCv2000 or an SC7020 system.
31; ;00:03:22,191 --> 00:03:26,422; ;The second option there, you can log in to a Storage Center or a Data Center.
32; ;00:03:26,422 --> 00:03:31,503; ;Here's where you going to open, actually open the DSM client.
33; ;00:03:31,503 --> 00:03:35,003; ;Configure this host to access a Storage Center.
34; ;00:03:35,003 --> 00:03:43,660; ;From here, you install the Server Agent and this makes creating volumes and presenting them a whole lot simpler.
35; ;00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:49,774; ;And then the fourth one is configure VMware vSphere to access the Storage Center.
36; ;00:03:49,774 --> 00:03:59,406; ;This is going to configure the vCenter Server to access the Storage Center which is very similar to configuring a host.
37; ;00:03:59,406 --> 00:04:08,842; ;As I said, if you want to actually get in and manage a client, you'd go in here to the Log in to a Storage Center or Data Collector.
38; ;00:04:09,865 --> 00:04:18,381; ;Once you click on the Log in to a Storage Center or Data Collector link there, you're going to be taken to a screen that looks like this.
39; ;00:04:18,381 --> 00:04:21,630; ;This is the Dell Storage Manager Client.
40; ;00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:25,497; ;There you can put in the language that you want, default is English.
41; ;00:04:25,497 --> 00:04:28,663; ;You put in the user name and the password.
42; ;00:04:28,663 --> 00:04:39,112; ;And then you can put in either the host name or the IP address of either the Storage Center or the Data Collector.
43; ;00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:43,897; ;So it depends on which one that you're going to be working with.
44; ;00:04:43,897 --> 00:04:54,130; ;This is a direct connect right to a Storage Center server, a client in effect, you are going to go to a single system.
45; ;00:04:54,130 --> 00:05:01,087; ;There you'd be typing in the host name or IP address of that single system of the client itself.
46; ;00:05:01,087 --> 00:05:11,082; ;If you're going to be managing multiple systems, you'll need to connect to the Data Collector server, so there you'd put in the host name or the IP address of the Data Collector.
47; ;00:05:11,082 --> 00:05:24,072; ;If you initially go into the Data Collector and you don't see any systems yet, or if it's the first time you've logged in to the DSM, you're going to have to add Storage Centers in.
48; ;00:05:24,072 --> 00:05:29,997; ;Remember, if it's the first time you're into the Data Collector, you're going to need to add Storage Centers.
49; ;00:05:29,997 --> 00:05:40,080; ;Or certainly, if you're adding a Storage Center later on and you want to manage it from DSM, you need to add it in the Data Collector as well.
50; ;00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:46,982; ;One thing to be aware of is Storage Centers are associated with specific Dell Storage Manager users.
51; ;00:05:46,982 --> 00:05:53,018; ;Each user can view and manage only the Storage Centers that have been associated with their account.
52; ;00:05:53,018 --> 00:05:55,188; ;So keep that in mind.
53; ;00:05:55,188 --> 00:06:05,625; ;But to add a Storage Center, you select Dell Storage at the top, okay, so you're here in on Dell Storage, you highlight Storage, you get to Dell Storage.
54; ;00:06:05,625 --> 00:06:10,604; ;Highlight Storage Centers and you say Add Storage Centers so fairly intuitive.
55; ;00:06:10,604 --> 00:06:20,246; ;You'll enter either the Management IP address or the host name or an SC controller IP address or the host name.
56; ;00:06:20,246 --> 00:06:27,997; ;If it's a single controller SC series system, you'll enter in that single controller IP address or a host name.
57; ;00:06:27,997 --> 00:06:41,317; ;If it's a dual controller SC series, which again most of them are, you will have a specific management IP address and you'll enter that management IP address or that host name for the dual controller setup.
58; ;00:06:41,317 --> 00:06:43,040; ;You'll log in.
59; ;00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:47,421; ;We use admin and password here for user name and password in this case.
60; ;00:06:47,421 --> 00:06:54,085; ;The user names can have administrator, Volume Manager or Reporter level users.
61; ;00:06:54,085 --> 00:07:02,295; ;And that in the user manual, it will detail that much more succinctly.
62; ;00:07:02,295 --> 00:07:11,347; ;Just so you're aware, Volume Manager and Reporter level users are more restricted than Administrator level users just so you know.
63; ;00:07:11,347 --> 00:07:21,051; ;If a folder structure has been created, the user can select which folder to place the Storage Center in for organizational purposes.
64; ;00:07:21,051 --> 00:07:26,224; ;In our case here, we didn't have any folder structure, we just see the Storage Centers.
65; ;00:07:26,224 --> 00:07:33,585; ;If there's a lot of Storage Centers out there, it's probably a good idea to set up some type of folder structure.
66; ;00:07:33,585 --> 00:07:49,676; ;For the first time starting in Dell Storage Manager 2016 R1, and then you have to have Storage Center Operating System 7.0, the Dell Storage Manager can manage a PS Series array.
67; ;00:07:49,676 --> 00:08:01,764; ;This provides a great roadway or great pathway to go from a PS Series to an SC Series if that's the direction that the customer wants to go.
68; ;00:08:01,764 --> 00:08:19,365; ;We're going to go through some, highlight some things in terms of what is managed in the DSM and what is not currently managed in the DSM as well as what long term is not - there are no plans to add to the DSM.
69; ;00:08:19,365 --> 00:08:23,866; ;Let's start with what is supported in the SC Series.
70; ;00:08:23,866 --> 00:08:26,416; ;PS group management is supported.
71; ;00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:33,140; ;You can display ACL and super ACL, ACL being Access Control Lists.
72; ;00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:42,319; ;From a group-level, I can display, I can create, modify, delete, add, remove volumes to an access group.
73; ;00:08:42,319 --> 00:08:47,917; ;I have space statistics and I have summary tab details.
74; ;00:08:47,917 --> 00:08:57,140; ;From a volume-level, I can create, delete, modify, resize a volume.
75; ;00:08:57,140 --> 00:09:00,373; ;I can turn a volume online and offline.
76; ;00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:06,602; ;I have statistics and size for that volume, I can do thin provisioning.
77; ;00:09:06,602 --> 00:09:11,246; ;I can have volume clones, and we still have the concept of a recycle bin.
78; ;00:09:11,246 --> 00:09:17,389; ;Those are all things that I can do PS volume management from the Dell Storage Manager.
79; ;00:09:18,639 --> 00:09:22,751; ;I have snapshot management functionality,either manual or schedule snapshots.
80; ;00:09:22,751 --> 00:09:26,492; ;I can create, modify, delete, display a snapshot.
81; ;00:09:26,492 --> 00:09:34,102; ;I can snapshot, toggle snapshot online or offline, I can restore a volume from the snapshot.
82; ;00:09:34,102 --> 00:09:36,806; ;We also have replication management.
83; ;00:09:36,806 --> 00:09:46,608; ;Remember, I have the SC to PS functionality now as far as replication goes, I can do current replications and historical.
84; ;00:09:46,608 --> 00:09:51,609; ;So that I can look back and see information on replications in the past as well.
85; ;00:09:51,609 --> 00:09:57,959; ;And then finally, I have events, alerts, I can set up events and alarms as always.
86; ;00:09:57,959 --> 00:10:03,962; ;I have ability to do the Access Control List and super Access Control List management.
87; ;00:10:03,962 --> 00:10:08,378; ;Create, modify, apply and display all the ACLs.
88; ;00:10:08,378 --> 00:10:12,268; ;I have storage pool listing and statistics.
89; ;00:10:12,268 --> 00:10:19,266; ;Let's talk about things that are not in this initial release, the Dell Storage Manager 2016 R1.
90; ;00:10:19,266 --> 00:10:25,232; ;But these things, the plan anyway is that these will be included down the line.
91; ;00:10:25,232 --> 00:10:34,601; ;Volume templates and thin clones, volume collections, SAN HQ reports.
92; ;00:10:34,601 --> 00:10:43,923; ;Sync replications, snapshot collections, volume tags, group member management.
93; ;00:10:43,923 --> 00:10:50,768; ;Which would include listing details and statistics, operations that are part of group member management.
94; ;00:10:50,768 --> 00:10:56,061; ;Storage pool management, the ability to create and manage pools.
95; ;00:10:56,061 --> 00:11:02,526; ;Trigger failover and failback, this would be in the scenario of a PS to PS replication.
96; ;00:11:02,526 --> 00:11:06,576; ;Provision replications, PS to PS.
97; ;00:11:06,576 --> 00:11:15,873; ;Move existing replications from PS to PS over to a PS to SC replication.
98; ;00:11:15,873 --> 00:11:26,110; ;These are all things that aren't there today but down the line these are things that we will add to DSM management of the PS arrays.
99; ;00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:38,516; ;These are items then that are not planned for support in DSM, so they're currently part of PS series group management but we're not planning to port those over into DSM.
100; ;00:11:38,516 --> 00:11:44,528; ;We start with single group management like users, networks, etcetera, and configure.
101; ;00:11:44,528 --> 00:11:50,393; ;So things like group date and time, DCB configuration.
102; ;00:11:50,393 --> 00:12:06,858; ;Search operations on a volume or a folder, configure management networking, MTU configuration and self encrypting drives, RAID policy and pool policy configurations.
103; ;00:12:06,858 --> 00:12:16,521; ;Create, delete, modify, merge, storage pools so those are all things that are part of single group management and configure that will not be ported over.
104; ;00:12:16,521 --> 00:12:25,271; ;Other things, group security configurations, so things like create, modify, and delete admin accounts.
105; ;00:12:25,271 --> 00:12:27,876; ;The ability to the add and remove with AD.
106; ;00:12:29,435 --> 00:12:45,529; ;Authentications using RADIUS, SNMP setting to an access group, managing VDS or VSS authentication and control policies, okay, those are all group security configurations.
107; ;00:12:45,529 --> 00:12:58,600; ;And finally, some volume security configuration, ISNS configuration, multihost snapshot access control, those are volume security configurations.
108; ;00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:01,362; ;Then a few other things that are not going to be ported over.
109; ;00:13:01,362 --> 00:13:17,008; ;VVols, storage containers, protocol endpoints, PS Series installation and PS Series NAS, Network Attached Storage, that's the FS7600.
110; ;00:13:17,008 --> 00:13:24,439; ;These are all the things that as of this time are not planned for support in the Dell Storage Manager.
111; ;00:13:24,439 --> 00:13:31,734; ;Let's take a look at management of PS Series groups in the Dell Storage Manager interface.
112; ;00:13:31,734 --> 00:13:37,642; ;First of all, the PS Groups can be managed from within DSM.
113; ;00:13:37,642 --> 00:13:43,974; ;There will be a new folder which will contain PS Groups, so you see those PS Groups here.
114; ;00:13:43,974 --> 00:13:51,153; ;Another thing that's new in the Dell Storage Manager is a new table that will contain PS Groups.
115; ;00:13:51,153 --> 00:13:54,661; ;So there are your PS groups that it displays down here.
116; ;00:13:54,661 --> 00:14:05,540; ;Now keep in mind that these elements will only be shown when PS Groups are present in the system and they've been set up to be managed from DSM.
117; ;00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:11,696; ;A PS Series group is a fully functional iSCSI Storage Area Network.
118; ;00:14:11,696 --> 00:14:18,877; ;A group is created when one or more PS Series arrays are configured and connected to an IP network.
119; ;00:14:18,877 --> 00:14:26,014; ;In this virtualized storage system, the arrays become group members and share configuration data.
120; ;00:14:26,014 --> 00:14:32,428; ;A member belongs to a storage pool and is configured with a specific RAID policy.
121; ;00:14:32,428 --> 00:14:43,068; ;Each member cooperates with other members to enable the virtualization of disk storage, controllers, caches, and network connections.
122; ;00:14:43,068 --> 00:14:57,383; ;Because the virtualization technology mask the underlying complexity of the storage configuration, client servers see this group as a single entity, providing a centralized view of the storage data.
123; ;00:14:57,383 --> 00:15:02,524; ;That's kind of a quick one paragraph summary of a PS Series.
124; ;00:15:02,524 --> 00:15:12,488; ;For those of you who are more familiar with the SC Series, we just try to give you a quick one paragraph overview of what the PS Series is all about.
125; ;00:15:12,488 --> 00:15:19,443; ;When PS Series groups are added to the Data Collector, they're associated with specific Storage Manager users.
126; ;00:15:19,443 --> 00:15:25,840; ;These users can view and manage only the PS Series groups to which their mapped.
127; ;00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:32,772; ;PS Series groups that are visible to one Storage Manager user are not necessarily visible to another user.
128; ;00:15:32,772 --> 00:15:38,815; ;So if we look at what's involved with adding, remember, we have to add that PS Series group.
129; ;00:15:38,815 --> 00:15:52,541; ;From the user interface, from the client, DSM client, we just highlight Dell Storage and click on Add PS Group and you'll see this display here.
130; ;00:15:52,541 --> 00:16:01,138; ;And so the first thing that we're putting in there is the group or management IP of a PS group.
131; ;00:16:01,138 --> 00:16:19,472; ;Now if a PS Series group user account with Pool administrator or Volume administrator permissions is specified, access to the PS Series group from Storage Manager is restricted based on the PS Series group user account permissions.
132; ;00:16:19,472 --> 00:16:28,533; ;So you cannot add a PS Series group to Storage Manager using a user account with read-only account permissions.
133; ;00:16:28,533 --> 00:16:38,079; ;In our case here, you put in a user name for a PS group user account, and then of course that password that's associated with that user name.
134; ;00:16:39,174 --> 00:16:48,304; ;One other note, a Storage Manager user with Reporter privileges cannot add PS Series groups to Storage Managers.
135; ;00:16:49,785 --> 00:16:53,822; ;You can't add them to the DSM if you have Reporter privileges.
136; ;00:16:53,822 --> 00:17:14,377; ;So to add PS Series groups to a user with Reporter privileges, log in to the Data Collector using a Storage Manager user with Administrator or Volume Manager privileges and map the PS Series group to that reporter user on the Users and User Groups tap.
137; ;00:17:14,377 --> 00:17:20,834; ;PS Series group information can be obtained through the Dell Storage Manager.
138; ;00:17:20,834 --> 00:17:27,436; ;Statistics and reports can be gathered through SAN headquarters or SAN HQ.
139; ;00:17:27,436 --> 00:17:37,533; ;From the PS Series array, obviously, the customer would have had to purchase SAN HQ and be using it on the PS Series in order to pull this information.
140; ;00:17:37,533 --> 00:17:48,434; ;These are some of the information that you can get: you can get capacity, volumes and snapshots, performance information, hardware, and network status from the SAN HQ.
141; ;00:17:48,434 --> 00:18:03,798; ;From a Support standpoint, PS Series version 7, 8 or 9 can all be managed from DSM, as we said DSM 2016 R1 or higher will manage PS Series arrays.
142; ;00:18:03,798 --> 00:18:09,677; ;There are 8 PS groups per DSM Data Collector, 16 members per group.
143; ;00:18:09,677 --> 00:18:13,906; ;That's similar to what is in the PS Series.
144; ;00:18:13,906 --> 00:18:22,574; ;One thing that's nice in the DSM, there is a link that will launch the Group Manager from within DSM.
145; ;00:18:22,574 --> 00:18:25,063; ;So you see it there, launch Group Manager.
146; ;00:18:25,063 --> 00:18:36,983; ;You can right click on any PS Group and launch the Group Manager and the admin can insert his or her credentials to provide access into the Group Manager on the PS Series.
147; ;00:18:36,983 --> 00:18:45,718; ;This slide shows a storage usage summary of the PS Series groups as seen from within the DSM client.
148; ;00:18:45,718 --> 00:18:59,021; ;So you can see PS group usage, you can see the total space taken up by that PS Group, you can see the free space, and you can see the in-use space all from within there.
149; ;00:18:59,021 --> 00:19:07,606; ;In the bottom half of the screen there, you get a storage summary for that group, and how much space each group is currently using.
150; ;00:19:07,606 --> 00:19:14,022; ;What does it look like to create a PS Series volume in the Dell Storage Manager client?
151; ;00:19:14,022 --> 00:19:23,318; ;Well, what you do is you highlight that PS Series group from the Storage tab, in the client, in DSM.
152; ;00:19:23,318 --> 00:19:28,471; ;And then there's an option you see here called Create Volume.
153; ;00:19:28,471 --> 00:19:32,174; ;It comes up to the Create Volume screen and you've got the options.
154; ;00:19:32,174 --> 00:19:37,285; ;There's a handful of options here for those of you familiar with the PS Series.
155; ;00:19:37,285 --> 00:19:43,312; ;These are very similar to what an administrator would see from the Group Manager in the PS Series.
156; ;00:19:43,312 --> 00:19:59,907; ;Things like snapshot reserve, storage pool assignment, sector size, and whether the volume should be thinly provisioned or not are decisions an admin has to make here as well as from the PS Series Group Manager interface.
157; ;00:19:59,907 --> 00:20:07,425; ;There's lots of available information about an existing PS Series volume that you can see from DSM.
158; ;00:20:07,425 --> 00:20:21,594; ;The top of the screen not only shows the amount of space being taken up by the volume and the snapshot space being taken up in graph form, but then it shows detailed information then about that volume space.
159; ;00:20:21,594 --> 00:20:23,128; ;You see all that from here.
160; ;00:20:24,593 --> 00:20:33,462; ;Now other information that you can see for existing volumes, you can edit settings for that volume, you can set the Access Type.
161; ;00:20:33,462 --> 00:20:41,131; ;In other words whether it's read-write or read-only, allow shared access to the volume, those are different access types.
162; ;00:20:41,131 --> 00:20:51,585; ;You can create a clone, set the volume offline, I can create a snapshot Schedule, I can edit the Snapshot policy.
163; ;00:20:51,585 --> 00:20:54,645; ;I can manually create a snapshot from here.
164; ;00:20:54,645 --> 00:21:05,583; ;I can add an Access Policy Group, I can add Access Policies to the volume, I can create a Basic Access Point, and I can move the volume to a different folder.
165; ;00:21:05,583 --> 00:21:11,816; ;So all these are options about the PS volume and I can do from DSM.
166; ;00:21:11,816 --> 00:21:16,556; ;Besides those, the bottom half of the screen gives you lots of information as well.
167; ;00:21:16,556 --> 00:21:26,971; ;There's a summary that you can get from here and this tells you what's available on that bottom half of the screen, so you see schedules, which is snapshot and replication schedules.
168; ;00:21:26,971 --> 00:21:41,476; ;Access, so this is the Access Control List or the ACLs, including adding or removing Access Policy Groups, Access Policies or Basic Access Points, all those things can be done from here.
169; ;00:21:41,476 --> 00:21:49,292; ;This is Connections, so this shows the volume's iSCSI Settings using the iSCSI target and the public alias.
170; ;00:21:49,292 --> 00:21:55,678; ;It also shows the number of iSCSI connections and how long those iSCSI connections have been up.
171; ;00:21:55,678 --> 00:22:01,806; ;And then snapshots, so this will show all of the snapshots and when they were created.
172; ;00:22:01,806 --> 00:22:09,612; ;The PS Series provides some great storage charts and you can see those storage charts from here within the DSM.
173; ;00:22:09,612 --> 00:22:16,502; ;So you just go into, we've got a volume we're looking at here within the group, you see the Storage Chart there.
174; ;00:22:16,502 --> 00:22:24,380; ;In the Storage Chart, you see a list of all of the volumes, there within that group.
175; ;00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:27,998; ;I've got five volumes here that I'm taking a look at.
176; ;00:22:27,998 --> 00:22:42,586; ;Some of the information that you can get from these volumes, you've got Reported Space, InUse Space, Volume Reserve Space, Total Used Snapshot Space, and then I've got Snapshot Reserved Space as well.
177; ;00:22:42,586 --> 00:22:51,469; ;If you notice the view, this is a stacked view, however, there's also a separated view, so there's two different ways that you can look at this.
178; ;00:22:51,469 --> 00:22:56,708; ;In fact, Separated is the default view, but I kind of like the stacked view here.
179; ;00:22:56,708 --> 00:23:08,658; ;And you can also filter objects so the administrator can choose only the volumes he or she wants to see and then also gives you the choice of what space options that you want to see as well.
180; ;00:23:08,658 --> 00:23:17,061; ;That kind of concludes a quick walkthrough though how you can view the PS Series from within the Dell Storage Manager.
181; ;00:23:17,061 --> 00:23:24,959; ;There are certainly other things you can see from within DSM regarding the PS Series, but we wanted to give you kind of a highlighted view.
182; ;00:23:24,959 --> 00:23:31,729; ;Let's take a look then at other tab views that are available within the Dell Storage client.
183; ;00:23:31,729 --> 00:23:36,935; ;So this is going to be kind of an overview of the Storage tab here.
184; ;00:23:36,935 --> 00:23:42,012; ;We see a summary, this is detailed storage about every volume.
185; ;00:23:42,012 --> 00:23:55,087; ;Here's how you can take a look at the Hardware, there is IO Usage, there's a Charting view, and there are also Alerts and Logs you can take a look at just from this Dell Storage client view.
186; ;00:23:55,087 --> 00:24:00,975; ;And what we're going to do is we're going to analyze all those in little bit more detail in the next few slides.
187; ;00:24:00,975 --> 00:24:04,914; ;We're going to start our look through these different tabs from left to right.
188; ;00:24:04,914 --> 00:24:07,839; ;First of all, by looking at the Summary view.
189; ;00:24:09,083 --> 00:24:14,658; ;If you look at the Summary view, right up on the top here, you'll see a Status.
190; ;00:24:14,658 --> 00:24:22,045; ;You see any current alerts, you see Available space, Free, and Used space, there are some common actions you can do right from here.
191; ;00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:26,700; ;I can create a volume, I can create a server and then here are our objects.
192; ;00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:31,810; ;On this system, not a lot of usage, we've got 24 disks, a couple of system alerts.
193; ;00:24:31,811 --> 00:24:45,892; ;There's also a Storage Summary and this provides a list of various components, servers and volumes within this particular Storage Center system 60281 as you see here.
194; ;00:24:45,892 --> 00:24:50,683; ;And there's also Current Alerts, they would be displayed in the summary as well.
195; ;00:24:50,683 --> 00:24:56,622; ;If you were to scroll down the Summary tab, you would see some other information, things such as Object Count.
196; ;00:24:56,622 --> 00:25:03,738; ;Number of volumes, number of servers, number of disks, number of replays all those things are under the Object Count.
197; ;00:25:03,738 --> 00:25:15,082; ;You'd also see a Front End IO Summary, so this would give you front end performance characteristics both throughput in megabytes per second and IOs per second.
198; ;00:25:15,082 --> 00:25:25,652; ;If you were to scroll down a bit further, you would see Replications, and Replication Validation - whether your information in all volumes is replicating.
199; ;00:25:25,652 --> 00:25:30,429; ;Also a neat tab, you can look at is a top 10 fastest growing volumes.
200; ;00:25:30,429 --> 00:25:38,036; ;And then based on how fast they're growing when will those volumes be full.
201; ;00:25:38,036 --> 00:25:39,774; ;We're kind of giving an estimate of that.
202; ;00:25:39,774 --> 00:25:50,660; ;And then if there are any threshold alerts, they would be displayed here as well, so all of this is from the Summary tab within the Dell Storage client.
203; ;00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:59,508; ;As we went through the Summary tab, you notice that we've focused on a particular Storage Center, in this case, 60281.
204; ;00:25:59,508 --> 00:26:06,594; ;Now there's another option you can do from within the Summary tab and that is something referred to as a Comparison.
205; ;00:26:06,594 --> 00:26:08,436; ;Now notice the difference.
206; ;00:26:08,436 --> 00:26:21,395; ;I highlight Storage Center, so I've got five storage centers here and I just highlight storage centers so instead of an individual Storage Center, I highlight the storage centers and I can get a comparison view.
207; ;00:26:21,395 --> 00:26:29,611; ;A comparison view can be very powerful in determining what's the better performing SC Series array from one to another.
208; ;00:26:29,611 --> 00:26:37,908; ;This is the dropdown here from what you can view a comparison of, this is the same information here, obviously, it is a little bit easier read.
209; ;00:26:37,908 --> 00:26:49,212; ;I can compare the system status, storage and front end summaries, current alerts, top 10 fastest growing volumes, all those things that we just talked about from the Summary tab.
210; ;00:26:49,212 --> 00:26:57,500; ;But now I can compare them from one SC Series to another, all from a single pane of glass.
211; ;00:26:57,500 --> 00:27:01,226; ;Now let's look at the Storage usage tab, you see it highlighted here.
212; ;00:27:01,226 --> 00:27:06,509; ;We looked at the Summary previously, let's look at the Storage usage tab and see what we have.
213; ;00:27:06,509 --> 00:27:10,796; ;It really contains a blend of historical as well as current data.
214; ;00:27:10,796 --> 00:27:17,600; ;The Storage tab can compare storage use and consumption to make sure storage is used appropriately.
215; ;00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:28,804; ;From here, a user can display, we're showing volumes here, and we'll talk a little bit more about some of these categories under the volumes highlighted.
216; ;00:27:28,804 --> 00:27:44,612; ;But you can also view this by servers, by disks, by storage types, snapshot profiles or storage profiles, there are lot of different ways to compare this historical and current data.
217; ;00:27:44,612 --> 00:27:47,824; ;We'll just look at the volumes here in our case.
218; ;00:27:47,824 --> 00:27:54,438; ;If you look at volumes, it's the first one on the list primarily because probably the most often used.
219; ;00:27:54,438 --> 00:27:58,303; ;You see all the volumes listed and how full are each of the volumes.
220; ;00:27:58,303 --> 00:28:08,244; ;But then there's also some details around each, I just wanted to find each of these headings for you to give you a little bit of an idea of the value of this view.
221; ;00:28:08,244 --> 00:28:15,828; ;Active Space, this is the amount of space used by a volume if the volume has no snapshots attached to it.
222; ;00:28:15,828 --> 00:28:19,758; ;It doesn't include any RAID overhead, I've got no snapshots.
223; ;00:28:19,758 --> 00:28:27,727; ;Snapshot Overhead then is the amount of space not actively being used by a volume and it's contained in its snapshots.
224; ;00:28:27,727 --> 00:28:30,405; ;This number also does not include RAID overhead.
225; ;00:28:31,585 --> 00:28:42,763; ;Actual Space is defined as active space plus snapshot overhead, that will give you your Actual Space, okay?
226; ;00:28:42,763 --> 00:28:47,110; ;This number, of course, does not include RAID overhead because the other two didn't.
227; ;00:28:47,110 --> 00:28:52,698; ;And then finally, Total Disk Space is the actual amount of disk space that the volume uses.
228; ;00:28:52,698 --> 00:28:56,557; ;And this number does include RAID overhead.
230; ;00:28:59,102 --> 00:29:15,679; ;And the hardware tab is primarily used to examine what's going on in the hardware, so you see Controllers, you see Enclosures, IO Ports, Fibre Channel world wide names, iSCSI IQN names.
231; ;00:29:17,296 --> 00:29:27,516; ;You see the SAS ports, from a hardware perspective, this is where you're going to go and really take a look at what's happening in the environment.
232; ;00:29:27,516 --> 00:29:37,795; ;But also, a lot of our users aren't aware of this but from the Hardware tab a person has a lot of other options that you can do.
233; ;00:29:37,795 --> 00:29:43,603; ;Here we're highlighting one of the SC Series arrays, SC25.
234; ;00:29:43,603 --> 00:29:47,490; ;Notice, there is a little tab called Actions.
235; ;00:29:47,490 --> 00:30:04,120; ;And from the Actions tab, you have the ability to create volumes, servers, snapshot profiles, storage profiles, you can create a replication from here, you can add a UPS from here and there is some system setups as well.
236; ;00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:07,855; ;So there's a lot of functionality you've got in here.
229; ;00:28:56,557 --> 00:28:59,102; ;The next tab over here is the Hardware tab.
237; ;00:30:07,855 --> 00:30:16,454; ;The system setup, for example, includes options to check for updates, if there's SCOS update available.
238; ;00:30:18,486 --> 00:30:23,160; ;You can also shutdown or restart in SC Series from here.
239; ;00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:28,309; ;If it's a dual controller system, you can shutdown an individual controller from that System tab.
240; ;00:30:28,309 --> 00:30:30,906; ;There's a lot of functionality built within here.
241; ;00:30:30,906 --> 00:30:47,020; ;You can see the Volume options, you can of course, create a volume, I can create multiple volumes, I can create a volume folder, and then something new, with this release of SCOS 7.0 was the VVols functionality.
242; ;00:30:47,020 --> 00:31:01,007; ;If you remember when we talked about VVols or if you're familiar with the VVols, a storage container gives a quantity of storage made available for the placement of the VVols, so you can create that storage container right here.
243; ;00:31:01,007 --> 00:31:04,742; ;So there is lot of functionality really right from the Hardware tab.
244; ;00:31:04,742 --> 00:31:08,360; ;Other actions that you've got, you can create a server from here.
245; ;00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:19,741; ;You can create a server cluster, I can do a folder, and again, we're not going to go through all of these but you get kind of an idea of the functionality that you have right from within the hardware tab.
246; ;00:31:19,741 --> 00:31:28,675; ;But of course, one of the main ideas right behind the Hardware tab is actually looking and being able to get information about the controllers.
247; ;00:31:28,675 --> 00:31:37,163; ;In our display here, everything is up, everything is fine, but you would actually see some red dots.
248; ;00:31:37,163 --> 00:31:48,286; ;If a Fibre Channel card was down for example in the array, you would see that, if there was a bad disk drive in one of the enclosures, you would see that, it would jump out at you as well.
249; ;00:31:48,286 --> 00:31:56,866; ;There's a lot of things you can do really from the Hardware tab in the Dell Storage Manager client.
250; ;00:31:56,866 --> 00:32:01,531; ;Now let's take a look at the IO Usage tab, next one on the list there.
251; ;00:32:01,531 --> 00:32:07,652; ;The IO Usage tab displays performance information on the selected Storage Center.
252; ;00:32:07,652 --> 00:32:14,896; ;You're going to use the IO Usage tab to compare IO information and really monitor the Storage Center's performance.
253; ;00:32:14,896 --> 00:32:23,270; ;The IO Usage tab can keep the history of the Storage Centers performance up to a year, depending on what database that you're using.
254; ;00:32:23,270 --> 00:32:31,656; ;It's a great way to kind of analyze trending and how to compare one year to the next.
255; ;00:32:31,656 --> 00:32:39,392; ;As far as how to bring it up from the IO Usage tab, you just click on the IO Usage tab from the Storage.
256; ;00:32:39,392 --> 00:32:50,969; ;Now a couple of things I want to call your attention to: these little icons up here in the upper left, there's a refresh like a Refresh button there, that updates the charts.
257; ;00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:55,339; ;So you can get the most recent update by just hitting that kind of a refresh button.
258; ;00:32:55,339 --> 00:32:58,660; ;It's not this one here, it's actually this one here.
259; ;00:32:58,660 --> 00:33:05,903; ;And the other one that I want to call your attention to is the Save button, that's a little, little floppy disk looking thing there.
260; ;00:33:05,903 --> 00:33:11,228; ;That allows you to save this information to a file, so you can go back and look at it later.
261; ;00:33:11,228 --> 00:33:12,649; ;It's very powerful.
262; ;00:33:12,649 --> 00:33:19,187; ;You'll see this little floppy disk in a lot of different displays in the Dell Storage Manager.
263; ;00:33:19,187 --> 00:33:25,665; ;So if you need to look at historical information or any other information, it's a great way to do it.
264; ;00:33:25,665 --> 00:33:33,760; ;You just highlight, click on the floppy disk there, and you're going to save the information that's on that particular screen.
265; ;00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:36,208; ;The next tab up is the Charting tab.
266; ;00:33:37,308 --> 00:33:41,735; ;The Charting tab displays the performance information.
267; ;00:33:41,735 --> 00:33:46,692; ;At the selected Storage Center, at the current time.
268; ;00:33:46,692 --> 00:33:51,950; ;So keep that in mind: the Charting tab only keeps information up to an hour.
269; ;00:33:51,950 --> 00:34:05,222; ;The value really of the Charting tab is let's say, you've got a bottleneck on one of the disks or one of the servers or on a particular volume, you get your all your options here.
270; ;00:34:05,222 --> 00:34:11,461; ;Just go to the Charting tab and it will give you real time information as far as what's happening right now.
271; ;00:34:11,461 --> 00:34:27,800; ;You can get system performance, volume performance, server performance, disk performance, controller port performance, so it's really a way to drill down and get all the way down to a card if you need to.
272; ;00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:30,958; ;But again, it's not for historical, so it's just real time.
273; ;00:34:30,958 --> 00:34:41,294; ;And you'll see our options here we just talked about on the Usage tab that is the refresh, the ability to save this information to a file and look at it later.
274; ;00:34:41,294 --> 00:34:49,160; ;Remember we talked earlier that starting with SCOS 6.6, a Data Collector was no longer required.
275; ;00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:58,781; ;You could manage a Storage Center directly from Dell Storage Manager client view, no Data Collector required.
276; ;00:34:58,781 --> 00:35:03,749; ;Most often you'll see this in an SCv2000 system.
277; ;00:35:03,740 --> 00:35:07,740; ;It doesn't necessarily have to be, but that's a lot of what you'll see.
278; ;00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:14,490; ;It's kind of the entry level SAN, so you're not having to have a Data Collector server, you just have a single view.
279; ;00:35:14,495 --> 00:35:27,213; ;A lot of things you can do from here: you can create a volume, you can edit a volume and server, you can do a snapshot profile, all of those things are available.
280; ;00:35:27,213 --> 00:35:29,522; ;You can see the difference certainly.
281; ;00:35:29,522 --> 00:35:36,787; ;There is not a lot of the same kind of functionality, so here are all the list of things that aren't available if you don't have a Data Collector.
282; ;00:35:36,787 --> 00:35:49,900; ;You don't have historical IO and storage usage - we just talked about the Usage tab -, the reports, the threshold alerts, chargebacks, there's no server agent applicability here.
283; ;00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:53,779; ;Replication or Live Volume is not something you can track from within here.
284; ;00:35:53,779 --> 00:36:02,633; ;FluidFS management, and Fluid Cache management, none of those things are available from within the DSM.
285; ;00:36:02,633 --> 00:36:05,668; ;Let's go through a couple review questions here.
286; ;00:36:05,668 --> 00:36:14,857; ;First one, management of PS Series Groups can occur in the DSM if the PS Series is running what firmware version or versions?
287; ;00:36:14,857 --> 00:36:15,933; ;You remember that?
288; ;00:36:16,943 --> 00:36:17,953; ;Yep.
289; ;00:36:17,953 --> 00:36:19,574; ;7.0, 8.0 or 9.0.
290; ;00:36:19,574 --> 00:36:27,057; ;So basically starting with PS Series release 7.0, Group Manager 7.0.
291; ;00:36:27,057 --> 00:36:28,060; ;True or false.
292; ;00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:33,115; ;New volumes can be created from the hardware tab in the Dell Storage client?
293; ;00:36:33,115 --> 00:36:39,973; ;Certainly, that's true, because we talk quite a bit about how you can actually do that from the Hardware tab.
294; ;00:36:39,973 --> 00:36:48,810; ;What information is required to enter in the DSM client so a PS Series Group can be managed from the client?
295; ;00:36:48,810 --> 00:36:49,877; ;You remember what that was?
296; ;00:36:52,096 --> 00:36:58,620; ;Group or management IP of the PS Series group, that is a requirement.
1; ;00:00:01,123 --> 00:00:09,276; ;We're going to finish up this DSM module by talking about the Dell Demo Center and why it's such a critical tool.
2; ;00:00:09,276 --> 00:00:16,893; ;I would highly encourage everyone to go into the Dell Demo Center and at least kind of play around with it.
3; ;00:00:16,893 --> 00:00:18,995; ;And I'll show you a couple of options here.
4; ;00:00:18,995 --> 00:00:23,978; ;But the way you get into it, you go into demos.Dell.com.
5; ;00:00:23,978 --> 00:00:35,097; ;As you might guess, it's a great way to just go in and play around with the interface, of course you can also deliver a demo from here to a customer or a prospect.
6; ;00:00:35,097 --> 00:00:38,673; ;When you get in there, there's lots of help available.
7; ;00:00:38,673 --> 00:00:48,009; ;A couple things about the Demo Center, it's cloud based, you can deliver demos directly, you can download, or just launch the demo from there.
8; ;00:00:48,009 --> 00:00:51,413; ;There are live demos as well as simulators.
9; ;00:00:51,413 --> 00:00:54,500; ;And it walks you through how to log in.
10; ;00:00:54,500 --> 00:01:03,831; ;If you're a partner, if you're an approved channel partner, you just log in using your partner direct credentials.
11; ;00:01:03,831 --> 00:01:08,987; ;If you're a Dell employee, you can log in as SSO-enabled.
12; ;00:01:08,987 --> 00:01:13,055; ;You can log in now and you're going to be taken right in.
13; ;00:01:13,055 --> 00:01:15,714; ;And then here are some questions that you can answer.
14; ;00:01:15,714 --> 00:01:22,772; ;Contact us gives you feedback right away from the Demo Center folks.
15; ;00:01:22,772 --> 00:01:32,003; ;Once you get logged in to the Demo Center, you're presented with a list, a complete list of available demos as well as labs.
16; ;00:01:32,003 --> 00:01:40,367; ;Different categories include Cloud Client Computing, Networking, Server, Software as well as Storage.
17; ;00:01:40,367 --> 00:01:45,366; ;There are multiple customer demos as well as several training labs available.
18; ;00:01:45,366 --> 00:01:54,592; ;The team is constantly adding more demos and labs, so be sure to check back often to see what's new as far as what you can play with.
19; ;00:01:54,592 --> 00:02:04,200; ;There is a search function within here, so you don't have to look at all of the demos and labs, you can do a search by SC Series which is one of the things that we did here.
20; ;00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:08,581; ;And this brings up the screen.
21; ;00:02:08,581 --> 00:02:13,698; ;We started, the first thing we're going to look at here is the SC Series Lab.
22; ;00:02:13,698 --> 00:02:22,086; ;The next slide, we're going to see that and look what is all involved when you hit the Deploy button to actually deploy the lab.
23; ;00:02:22,086 --> 00:02:24,950; ;We'll talk about what the lab is.
24; ;00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:29,974; ;The other option is actually scheduling a demo.
25; ;00:02:29,974 --> 00:02:42,893; ;For example, if you wanted to schedule a demo on the SC4020, you would click on Book and a calendar would come up and you would go in and say the time that you want to schedule that demo.
26; ;00:02:42,893 --> 00:02:45,694; ;You can put whatever length you think the demo might be.
27; ;00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:49,600; ;You might want to give it a little extra time to practice.
28; ;00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:55,640; ;It's really a good idea to run through the lab at least once before the actual demo.
29; ;00:02:55,641 --> 00:02:59,966; ;Give yourself some time to practice before the demo.
30; ;00:02:59,966 --> 00:03:07,276; ;You might just schedule the demo, the SC4020 even, or a schedule that SC Series Lab, either way.
31; ;00:03:07,276 --> 00:03:12,655; ;Now the demo showcases the full function of the DSM interface.
32; ;00:03:12,655 --> 00:03:29,272; ;And with the demo, what you want to make sure and do is provision storage, create snapshots and storage policies against volumes, mount and recover replays, play with the vSphere plug-in.
33; ;00:03:29,272 --> 00:03:46,260; ;Access to vCenter via client and the web client functionality, launch DSM to show advanced Storage Resource Management, replicate volumes to another array, detail reporting on consumption, even show chargeback operations.
34; ;00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:49,121; ;And you can show Replay Manager as well.
35; ;00:03:49,121 --> 00:03:56,386; ;So there's a lot of things that you want to get your hands on first before the actual demo starts.
36; ;00:03:56,386 --> 00:04:05,676; ;If I'm going to activate the DSM SC Series Lab from the Demo Center, this is what the screen will look like.
37; ;00:04:05,676 --> 00:04:16,464; ;Now it is a virtual lab that provides an on-demand training offering where you can gain hands-on experience using the tool in demos.Dell.com.
38; ;00:04:16,464 --> 00:04:19,605; ;So in a vLab or Virtual Lab.
39; ;00:04:19,605 --> 00:04:34,281; ;But in a vLab, users are presented a gold-standard demo recording illustrating the delivery of best-practice demonstrations that actually link customer pain-points to solutions in the SC Series.
40; ;00:04:34,281 --> 00:04:42,161; ;You'll have a live instance of the demo, so you can practice in parallel with the demo, so you can be going side by side.
41; ;00:04:42,161 --> 00:04:54,769; ;The main goal of the vLab is to help Dell and Dell Channel Partners, technical sales folks deliver technical customer demonstrations to better illustrate the capability of the SC Series.
42; ;00:04:54,769 --> 00:05:04,456; ;Now it's not really suited for customer sales demo, so you don't want to use this in place of using one of the demo systems.
43; ;00:05:04,456 --> 00:05:11,722; ;However, we recommend that you use the one that we showed in the previous slide where we talked about SC4020.
44; ;00:05:11,722 --> 00:05:20,404; ;If you want to start the demo now once you're in this screen, you can click on Deploy to start this lab now.
45; ;00:05:20,404 --> 00:05:27,657; ;If you've already set up the vLab but you didn't have a chance to actually run it, this box instead of Deploy will say My Demos.
46; ;00:05:27,657 --> 00:05:32,251; ;But if you're first going into it, Deploy will be able to start the lab now.
47; ;00:05:32,251 --> 00:05:39,739; ;And I would recommend, before you start the lab, is to download the documents for this lab.
48; ;00:05:39,739 --> 00:05:42,309; ;This is what this Guide box is.
49; ;00:05:42,309 --> 00:05:49,266; ;That will really help you kind of stay focused and proceed step by step through the vLab.
50; ;00:05:49,266 --> 00:05:54,477; ;Now there's a very powerful tool that is part of the Demo Center.
51; ;00:05:54,477 --> 00:06:02,156; ;It's going to be a part of the vLab as well, but anytime you go in here, you have the access to it, and that is the Virtual Rack.
52; ;00:06:02,156 --> 00:06:04,298; ;We're showing you the Virtual Rack here.
53; ;00:06:04,298 --> 00:06:07,579; ;It's showing the SC4020.
54; ;00:06:07,579 --> 00:06:17,612; ;I highly would encourage if you are doing the vLab or just getting into the demo to look at the Virtual Rack.
55; ;00:06:17,612 --> 00:06:28,728; ;You have the ability to look at the front picture of the 4020, you can actually flip it around, and that's what these little arrows are in the green, you can see the back of what it looks like.
56; ;00:06:28,728 --> 00:06:32,221; ;You can also see the expansion enclosures.
57; ;00:06:32,221 --> 00:06:35,988; ;SC400, 420, SC280.
58; ;00:06:35,988 --> 00:06:45,474; ;You can really get in, and it's good for you as a user but certainly you can show your customers or your prospects what the equipment looks like.
59; ;00:06:45,474 --> 00:06:52,780; ;It will give you really a feel for what the hardware looks like without having the hardware right in front of you.
60; ;00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:57,720; ;It's a great tool, I highly encourage you to take a look at that Virtual Rack.
1; ;00:00:02,334 --> 00:00:06,744; ;Before we get started into the content, let's start with the discussion question.
2; ;00:00:06,744 --> 00:00:12,434; ;Think about this, what means of protecting data can you list?
3; ;00:00:12,434 --> 00:00:16,788; ;And, of course, we're going to discuss some of these as we go through the module.
4; ;00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:28,970; ;Here's a couple of different things that we're going to cover here in this module: RAID, replication, snapshots, and encryption.
5; ;00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:32,877; ;There are probably a few others there that you could have listed, that would have been fine too.
6; ;00:00:32,877 --> 00:00:36,735; ;But here are four ways of protecting data.
7; ;00:00:36,735 --> 00:00:42,141; ;Let's start our discussion of ways to protect data by talking about RAID.
8; ;00:00:42,141 --> 00:00:46,955; ;RAID stands for Redundant Array of Independent Disks.
9; ;00:00:46,955 --> 00:00:50,971; ;And it's a method of using multiple drives as one storage pool.
10; ;00:00:50,971 --> 00:00:53,687; ;That's the way we do it in the SC Series.
11; ;00:00:53,687 --> 00:01:00,429; ;There are different RAID levels, and each RAID type offers different performance and redundancy levels.
12; ;00:01:00,429 --> 00:01:04,224; ;This slide is going to provide a general discussion of RAID.
13; ;00:01:04,224 --> 00:01:17,765; ;The SC Series supports RAID 0, RAID 5-5, RAID 5-9, RAID 6, RAID 10, and RAID 10 dual mirror.
14; ;00:01:17,765 --> 00:01:21,440; ;And we're going to talk about each of these in the next handful of slides.
15; ;00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:24,108; ;First, we start with RAID 0.
16; ;00:01:24,108 --> 00:01:31,697; ;RAID 0 offers fast performance, but there's no redundancy, that's the key drawback of RAID 0.
17; ;00:01:31,697 --> 00:01:35,037; ;Data is striped across all the drives in the array.
18; ;00:01:35,037 --> 00:01:48,827; ;So all drives are used to store data, but the problem is if one drive fails, that information is lost, that information could be on any one of the drives, but that information can be lost if a drive fails.
19; ;00:01:48,827 --> 00:01:56,173; ;Because of that, we see very few customers actually use RAID 0 in a production environment.
20; ;00:01:56,173 --> 00:01:58,652; ;Next up, we have RAID 1.
21; ;00:01:58,652 --> 00:02:02,681; ;RAID 1 offers good performance and high availability.
22; ;00:02:02,681 --> 00:02:10,297; ;Data is striped across one drive, notice the A there, and is mirrored to a second drive.
23; ;00:02:10,297 --> 00:02:16,022; ;So if either drive fails, the remaining drive maintains access to the data.
24; ;00:02:16,022 --> 00:02:19,332; ;Of course, the tradeoff is in cost.
25; ;00:02:19,332 --> 00:02:25,647; ;While both drives are used, the available storage space is only half of the raw disk.
26; ;00:02:25,647 --> 00:02:28,382; ;This makes the cost of storage high.
27; ;00:02:28,382 --> 00:02:33,812; ;By definition, RAID 1 only uses two drives.
28; ;00:02:33,812 --> 00:02:40,647; ;Real-world practicality, we don't see that in the SC Series array.
29; ;00:02:40,647 --> 00:02:47,228; ;In fact, we really don't even support RAID 1, we support RAID 10, which we'll talk about in a minute.
30; ;00:02:47,228 --> 00:02:49,247; ;We don't actually support RAID 1.
31; ;00:02:49,247 --> 00:02:58,821; ;But that is two drives where I have got data on one drive and a mirror of that data on the other drive.
32; ;00:02:58,821 --> 00:03:02,703; ;The next RAID option in the SC Series is RAID 5.
33; ;00:03:02,703 --> 00:03:06,778; ;RAID 5 offers good performance and efficient storage.
34; ;00:03:06,778 --> 00:03:13,819; ;Data is striped across all the multiple drives in a pool but a parity bit is added.
35; ;00:03:13,819 --> 00:03:16,085; ;You can see that's what the Ps are there.
36; ;00:03:16,085 --> 00:03:24,468; ;So if a drive fails, the missing data can be reconstructed from the remaining drives and this parity information.
37; ;00:03:24,468 --> 00:03:28,803; ;The parity information consumes the equivalent of one drive.
38; ;00:03:28,803 --> 00:03:38,807; ;Usable storage is the total drive space minus one drive, and we'll talk more about parity in the different RAID 5 options coming up in the next slide.
39; ;00:03:40,238 --> 00:03:43,665; ;Another RAID level that's supported is RAID 10.
40; ;00:03:43,665 --> 00:03:50,205; ;The beauty of RAID 10 is that it offers fast performance and high availability.
41; ;00:03:50,205 --> 00:03:55,855; ;Data blocks are mirrored to other drives and then striped.
42; ;00:03:55,855 --> 00:04:00,064; ;So if a drive fails, data is still accessible from the mirror.
43; ;00:04:00,064 --> 00:04:07,934; ;Having an exact copy of, for example, page A, page B, etcetera.
44; ;00:04:07,934 --> 00:04:14,374; ;Rebuild times are much shorter since no parity needs to be calculated.
45; ;00:04:14,374 --> 00:04:20,556; ;The tradeoff is cost, so it's kind of a performance versus cost discussion here.
46; ;00:04:20,556 --> 00:04:30,561; ;Usable space is half of the raw disk space in the case of RAID 10 but is much faster than RAID 5.
47; ;00:04:30,561 --> 00:04:40,460; ;The use of the different RAID types that the SC Series supports has a direct impact on the amount of storage consumed on the disks when a write occurs.
48; ;00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:48,630; ;The SC Series implements RAID 5 in one of two methods: RAID 5-5 and RAID 5-9.
49; ;00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:55,982; ;RAID 5-5 is basically what we talked about on the last slide, which includes a parity bit every fifth disk.
50; ;00:04:55,982 --> 00:05:08,140; ;That ends up being a 20% overhead, while RAID 5-9 includes a parity bit every 9th disk has an 11% overhead.
51; ;00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:12,884; ;The SC Series uses RAID 5-9 by default.
52; ;00:05:12,884 --> 00:05:22,206; ;As we look, as we compare RAID 10 to each of the RAID 5s, RAID 10 is the fastest performing RAID type by far.
53; ;00:05:22,206 --> 00:05:25,303; ;Certainly, when it comes to writes, it's not even close.
54; ;00:05:25,303 --> 00:05:28,812; ;Reads, about the same actually from a performance standpoint.
55; ;00:05:28,812 --> 00:05:34,282; ;But if it's a write, it's going to be, RAID 10 is going to be much, much faster.
56; ;00:05:34,282 --> 00:05:39,231; ;However, of course, it consumes two times the raw space because of the way that it does mirroring.
57; ;00:05:40,366 --> 00:05:47,544; ;RAID 5-5 medium performance on writes, little or no impact on reads as we said.
58; ;00:05:47,544 --> 00:05:50,941; ;It needs at least five disks to use.
59; ;00:05:50,941 --> 00:05:56,416; ;You see five there in our little picture, that's the minimum number is five.
60; ;00:05:56,416 --> 00:06:07,628; ;It does provide better performance in degraded mode because it uses half the IOs, for example, as RAID 5-9 does.
61; ;00:06:07,628 --> 00:06:16,120; ;Speaking RAID 5-9, it really provides the same performance as RAID 5-5 as far as writes go.
62; ;00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:19,496; ;Reads are about the same with all three of these.
63; ;00:06:20,656 --> 00:06:25,011; ;It needs at least nine disks in the array.
64; ;00:06:25,011 --> 00:06:28,103; ;So it's a minimum of nine disks.
65; ;00:06:28,103 --> 00:06:34,734; ;Because there are nine disks, there's a greater possibility of losing a disk in the RAID set.
66; ;00:06:34,734 --> 00:06:42,958; ;And it does provide slightly less performance if one of the drives fail than RAID 5-5 does.
67; ;00:06:42,958 --> 00:06:50,690; ;In the SC Series, RAID 5 and RAID 10 are considered single redundancy.
68; ;00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:51,866; ;What does that mean?
69; ;00:06:51,866 --> 00:07:05,615; ;Well, in a scenario like this, if I lose this drive out of these nine that make up this set, if I lose this drive, I'm fine, right, because that's what I have the parity for.
70; ;00:07:05,615 --> 00:07:18,887; ;If I were to lose say this drive, all of a sudden, I lose access to my data, right because if two of these drives fail, then I've got problems.
71; ;00:07:18,887 --> 00:07:30,207; ;That single redundant mode, you still have the hot spare and you still have the parity or the mirroring to give you that extra level of comfort if a drive fails.
72; ;00:07:30,207 --> 00:07:36,607; ;However, it's not as comfortable, shall we say, as dual redundancy.
73; ;00:07:36,607 --> 00:07:44,816; ;And this is what we're seeing more and more of on SC Series systems today, that being dual redundancy.
74; ;00:07:44,816 --> 00:07:54,892; ;And really the main reason that we're seeing more and more dual redundancy being used is because of the size of the disk drives.
75; ;00:07:54,892 --> 00:08:03,890; ;The drives are getting larger and larger, both the spinning hard disks, the HDDs, and the flash drives, right, the SEDs.
76; ;00:08:03,890 --> 00:08:05,867; ;They keep getting larger and larger.
77; ;00:08:05,867 --> 00:08:15,601; ;And the issue obviously is it takes longer and longer to rebuild a 2 terabyte drive, a 6 terabyte drive.
78; ;00:08:15,601 --> 00:08:21,474; ;It's going to take a whole lot longer to rebuild one of those than a 146 gig drive.
79; ;00:08:21,474 --> 00:08:29,326; ;A 2 terabyte drive or 4 or 6 or 8 terabyte drive simply is going to take longer to rebuild.
80; ;00:08:29,326 --> 00:08:43,352; ;Which means say out of these 10, there's a better chance of two of these drives failing in that  it could take up to a day, it could take 24 hours to rebuild a failed disk.
81; ;00:08:43,352 --> 00:08:52,252; ;If I've got two, if I've got dual redundancy, I can afford two drive fails.
82; ;00:08:52,252 --> 00:08:59,183; ;And that's going to give me obviously a whole lot more protection than if I could only afford to lose one drive.
83; ;00:08:59,183 --> 00:09:09,802; ;Dual redundancy is provided with RAID 6 or RAID 10 dual mirror, those are the choices in the SC Series.
84; ;00:09:09,802 --> 00:09:18,143; ;RAID 10 dual mirror offers protection by striping the data and then creating two mirrors.
85; ;00:09:18,143 --> 00:09:25,773; ;Obviously, this has a higher overhead than normal RAID 10, which would just have a single mirror.
86; ;00:09:25,773 --> 00:09:29,299; ;RAID 10 dual mirror overhead is 66%.
87; ;00:09:29,299 --> 00:09:35,668; ;Another option there is RAID 6.
88; ;00:09:35,668 --> 00:09:45,898; ;It offers similar protection by striping the data, then calculating a parity bit twice and writing each of the parity bits to a separate disk.
89; ;00:09:45,898 --> 00:09:54,241; ;You see P1 and P2, that's what we're showing here same thing down in the RAID 6-10.
90; ;00:09:54,241 --> 00:10:08,494; ;While the writes are definitely slower than RAID 10 or RAID 10 dual mirror, RAID 6 offers good read performance while doing its function of protecting against two drives failing within that set.
91; ;00:10:08,494 --> 00:10:12,630; ;RAID 6-6 is one version that's offered.
92; ;00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:15,732; ;It has an overhead of 34%.
93; ;00:10:15,732 --> 00:10:20,362; ;And RAID 6-10 has an overhead of 20%.
94; ;00:10:20,362 --> 00:10:32,415; ;As we talked about earlier with RAID 5-5, RAID 6-6, you have to have at least 6 drives available, and RAID 6-10, you have to have at least 10.
95; ;00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:42,437; ;And in the next slide, we're going to drill a little bit deeper into some rules within the SC Series regarding single and dual redundancy.
96; ;00:10:42,437 --> 00:10:48,172; ;Let's talk a little more about the rules of dual redundancy in an SC Series.
97; ;00:10:48,172 --> 00:10:52,244; ;In this chart, we're going to start with spinning disk or the HDDs.
98; ;00:10:52,244 --> 00:11:01,721; ;These are all valid as of SCOS 7.1 and whatever drive sizes were released as of 7.1.
99; ;00:11:01,721 --> 00:11:07,499; ;These rules are enforced though starting with SCOS 6.7.
100; ;00:11:07,499 --> 00:11:08,853; ;Just so you're aware of that.
101; ;00:11:08,853 --> 00:11:22,735; ;If you've got a customer that hasn't upgraded to version 7.0 or 7.1 yet, these rules will still be in place, be enforced if they have at least SCOS 6.7.
102; ;00:11:22,735 --> 00:11:29,189; ;As you see there, up to basically a terabyte, as far as the drive size goes, single redundancy is the default.
103; ;00:11:29,189 --> 00:11:40,384; ;When you're adding in new drives, it goes out, the operating system goes out and looks at the size of the drives and will default either single or dual redundancy.
104; ;00:11:40,384 --> 00:11:46,204; ;In the case of something that has a drive less than a terabyte, single redundancy is the default.
105; ;00:11:46,204 --> 00:12:01,585; ;If you move up, basically 1 terabyte to 2 terabytes, 967 gig to 1.93 terabyte, so what you're seeing there, dual redundancy is the default, but you have the option of changing it to single redundancy.
106; ;00:12:01,585 --> 00:12:13,186; ;If your customer is comfortable with single redundancy in a spinning disk that's less than 2 terabytes, they can change that default from dual to single.
107; ;00:12:13,186 --> 00:12:24,935; ;When you get up to the next size up in effect, 2 terabytes or higher, dual redundancy is required, when you're adding drives to a new page pool.
108; ;00:12:24,935 --> 00:12:31,206; ;And then 3 terabytes and up, dual redundancy is required when adding drives to an existing page pool.
109; ;00:12:32,505 --> 00:12:43,678; ;So the reason that we do it that way is just because it can be more disruptive to change the redundancy of an entire page pool.
110; ;00:12:44,748 --> 00:12:59,858; ;There's more involved than just saying, "Oh, I want to change that from single to dual," right, it has to go out and do calculations and make sure there's enough room to go from single to dual redundancy, okay?
111; ;00:12:59,858 --> 00:13:05,080; ;Now let's talk about dual redundancy in SSDs, in the flash drives.
112; ;00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:18,751; ;We start with the idea here up to, basically 2 terabytes, up to 2 terabytes for either write-intensive or read-intensive drives, single redundancy will be the default.
113; ;00:13:18,751 --> 00:13:29,302; ;So when you're adding in new SSDs, most of the write-intensive drives are smaller than 2 terabytes, single mode is the default.
114; ;00:13:29,302 --> 00:13:39,276; ;Dual redundancy then is the default when adding drives of basically 2 to 4 terabytes.
115; ;00:13:39,276 --> 00:13:43,565; ;If they're in that range, dual redundancy is the default.
116; ;00:13:43,565 --> 00:13:52,023; ;But you can change to single redundancy if you want just like up here, the default is single redundancy, but you can make it dual redundancy.
117; ;00:13:52,023 --> 00:14:01,276; ;When you get to the drives that are 4 terabytes and higher, then dual redundancy is required.
118; ;00:14:01,276 --> 00:14:15,519; ;Of course, SSD drives are faster, so a disk rebuild does go faster, but still, you want to make sure you're protected by having dual redundancy in place.
119; ;00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:23,525; ;Let's talk about RAID tiering in the SC Series, kind of compare how the SC Series works with traditional arrays.
120; ;00:14:23,525 --> 00:14:30,598; ;In traditional arrays, you have to really choose whether you want speed or capacity.
121; ;00:14:30,598 --> 00:14:36,606; ;All drives have to be pre-allocated for a single RAID level.
122; ;00:14:36,606 --> 00:14:38,749; ;This is a traditional storage.
123; ;00:14:38,749 --> 00:14:47,032; ;I would have to have all the drives set up as RAID 10 or all the drives set up as RAID 5 or 6.
124; ;00:14:47,032 --> 00:14:55,335; ;So RAID 10, as we just talked about, is going to be a lot faster, much faster writes, but it's going to require more disks.
125; ;00:14:55,335 --> 00:15:03,889; ;With RAID 5 or RAID 6, you don't need as many drives, but we talked about from a performance standpoint how much slower the writes are.
126; ;00:15:03,889 --> 00:15:09,081; ;So it's one or the other, it's a tradeoff you have to make in traditional arrays.
127; ;00:15:09,081 --> 00:15:13,501; ;The SC Series provides more performance with fewer drives.
128; ;00:15:13,501 --> 00:15:19,397; ;And the way we do that is we can have multiple RAID levels per drive.
129; ;00:15:19,397 --> 00:15:21,166; ;This is what we're showing you here.
130; ;00:15:21,166 --> 00:15:28,125; ;This is the same grouping of drives and we've got RAID 10 and RAID 5 or RAID 6.
131; ;00:15:28,125 --> 00:15:35,737; ;And actually you can have RAID 5 and RAID 6 on an individual spinning or SSD drive.
132; ;00:15:35,737 --> 00:15:40,699; ;That's because we do dynamic provisioning across all the drives.
133; ;00:15:40,699 --> 00:15:53,616; ;Another beauty of that dynamic provisioning is I don't need to pre-allocate those drives, I don't need to say they're RAID 10 or RAID 5, I just put the drives in and it figures out what it should be.
134; ;00:15:53,616 --> 00:15:55,541; ;It doesn't need to be anything.
135; ;00:15:55,541 --> 00:16:06,589; ;It's when I start writing data across it that it will make that determination, that data, that virtualization is going to say whether it's going to be RAID 5, 6, or 10.
136; ;00:16:06,589 --> 00:16:12,466; ;The way the RAID works, it auto-expands and contracts as needed.
137; ;00:16:12,466 --> 00:16:22,682; ;So the beauty of it, it provides the speed of RAID 10 with the efficient capacity utilization of RAID 5 or RAID 6.
138; ;00:16:22,682 --> 00:16:31,128; ;It will use RAID 10 for writes and it'll use RAID 5 and/or RAID 6 for reads.
139; ;00:16:31,128 --> 00:16:35,736; ;You're getting the performance here when you need it, when those initial writes come in.
140; ;00:16:35,736 --> 00:16:41,952; ;And as we said, reads, from a performance standpoint, are the same between RAID 10 and RAID 5 or 6.
141; ;00:16:41,952 --> 00:16:55,202; ;The reads are reading everything at the same speed, but RAID 5 or 6 is giving us much better efficiency of those drives in your SC Series.
1; ;00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:05,017; ;Now let's talk about the Application Protection Manager suite.
2; ;00:00:05,017 --> 00:00:15,256; ;The suite is made up of two client server applications that create and manage application-consistent snapshots on an SC Series.
3; ;00:00:15,256 --> 00:00:19,164; ;It requires a one-time license per SC Series array.
4; ;00:00:19,164 --> 00:00:30,484; ;The suite consists of Application Protection Manager or APM for Oracle and Replay Manager for both Microsoft and VMware.
5; ;00:00:30,484 --> 00:00:39,137; ;The VMware piece obviously would be the Microsoft databases running inside of VMware, right?
6; ;00:00:39,137 --> 00:00:48,597; ;And the license for Replay Manager includes Replay Manager 7.6 and above.
7; ;00:00:48,597 --> 00:00:57,288; ;A single Application Protection Manager suite license enables coverage for Oracle, Microsoft, and VMware.
8; ;00:00:57,288 --> 00:01:14,634; ;Combined with Replay Manager, the Application Protection Manager suite provides snapshots for VMware applications, snapshots for Microsoft, which would be SQL and Exchange, but also Hyper-V, and snapshots for Oracle.
9; ;00:01:14,634 --> 00:01:27,589; ;In the case of Oracle, the login requires a Dell Storage Manager username of either an admin or a volume manager that an existing admin has already configured in APM.
10; ;00:01:27,589 --> 00:01:31,157; ;Certainly, these applications can be purchased separately.
11; ;00:01:31,157 --> 00:01:39,004; ;You don't have to get the suite you can choose Replay Manager or Application Protection Manager, or both.
12; ;00:01:39,004 --> 00:01:43,117; ;Let's talk a little bit more about the APM for Oracle.
13; ;00:01:43,117 --> 00:01:45,021; ;We'll look at the features and the requirements.
14; ;00:01:45,021 --> 00:01:56,449; ;We'll start with the features, very easy interface to use, provides hardware-based snapshots for database protection and recovery, database volume mapping.
15; ;00:01:56,449 --> 00:02:06,195; ;And it comes with custom pre- and post-backup script creation with some very powerful APIs, for example, such as PowerShell.
16; ;00:02:06,195 --> 00:02:13,329; ;From a requirement standpoint, first of all, you have to be SCOS 6.6 or higher.
17; ;00:02:13,329 --> 00:02:17,801; ;You have to be at Enterprise Manager 2015 R2 and higher.
18; ;00:02:17,801 --> 00:02:29,240; ;And as we know, starting with 2016, so Dell Storage Manager 2016 R1, that's when the naming convention was changed.
19; ;00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:32,861; ;It was Enterprise Manager prior to being Dell Storage Manager.
20; ;00:02:32,861 --> 00:02:36,045; ;That's where that bullet is not a misprint.
21; ;00:02:36,045 --> 00:02:39,999; ;That's accurate, it's Enterprise Manager 2015 R2 and higher.
22; ;00:02:39,999 --> 00:02:45,004; ;Let's take a look then at the operating systems and platforms that are supported with APM.
23; ;00:02:45,004 --> 00:02:54,607; ;You have the Oracle Real Application Cluster, the RAC, with databases 11gR2 and 12c, those are supported.
24; ;00:02:54,607 --> 00:03:04,174; ;Those are supported in the APM 2015 R1 and then there was an APM 2016 R1.
25; ;00:03:04,174 --> 00:03:15,256; ;APM 2015 R1, of course, came out first and that's the one that was supported by Enterprise Manager 2015 R2 and higher.
26; ;00:03:15,256 --> 00:03:27,763; ;APM 2016 R1, that one does require Dell Storage Manager to manage it.
27; ;00:03:27,763 --> 00:03:34,590; ;Because it came out little bit later, Dell Storage Manager was out then at that point.
28; ;00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:42,912; ;We have Oracle Automatic Storage Management, ASM, supports that.
29; ;00:03:42,912 --> 00:03:49,584; ;Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.5, 6.6, and 7.0.
30; ;00:03:49,584 --> 00:03:58,164; ;Oracle Enterprise Linux, OEL, supported only with DSM 2016 R2 or higher.
31; ;00:03:58,164 --> 00:04:01,511; ;Just be aware of that as we just mentioned.
32; ;00:04:01,511 --> 00:04:09,617; ;And Oracle RAC One Node: that's supported with APM 2016 R1 or higher.
33; ;00:04:09,617 --> 00:04:14,744; ;Application Manager management tools consist of the following components.
34; ;00:04:14,744 --> 00:04:18,845; ;There's the Application Protection Manager Explorer.
35; ;00:04:18,845 --> 00:04:28,780; ;The explorer is a graphical user interface for creating and managing backup components, snapshot protection jobs, and restore points.
36; ;00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:36,740; ;Now also as part of that from a management tool standpoint is the Application Protection Manager Command Set for PowerShell.
37; ;00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:44,570; ;This is the snap into Windows PowerShell that provides cmdlets for scripting APM functions.
38; ;00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:55,370; ;The way the Application Protection Manager works, as we said, it creates a snapshot based on something called a protection set.
39; ;00:04:55,370 --> 00:05:01,606; ;A protection set is assigned a unique ID.
40; ;00:05:01,606 --> 00:05:06,404; ;And that protection set is made up of the snapshot data.
41; ;00:05:06,404 --> 00:05:17,006; ;This is one or more volumes or application components that are included in the snapshot, and then protection set options, options for that set itself.
42; ;00:05:17,006 --> 00:05:33,654; ;That's options for the individual snapshots such as the snapshot time, when it's supposed to expire, etcetera, things specific to the snapshots that are in that protection set.
43; ;00:05:33,654 --> 00:05:41,090; ;Let's look at a couple of features that were added as part of APM 2016 R1.
44; ;00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:53,898; ;One being the Oracle RAC One Node and what that is One Node is a single insistence of an Oracle RAC enabled database running on just one node in the cluster.
45; ;00:05:53,898 --> 00:06:12,238; ;What it does, it lets a user consolidate multiple databases into a single cluster, thereby adding flexibility to database consolidation, while reducing management overhead since the One Node is a standard deployment of a RAC.
46; ;00:06:12,238 --> 00:06:24,090; ;Snapshot, restore, and expose of databases installed on Oracle One Node clusters is supported along with support for clusters running VMware or Hyper-V.
47; ;00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:29,803; ;Guest OSes require an iSCSI connection to the database volume.
48; ;00:06:29,803 --> 00:06:37,534; ;Then the other enhancement of APM 2016 R1 is something referred to as enhanced expose.
49; ;00:06:37,534 --> 00:06:47,174; ;What that is is exposing database volumes back to the original host or any host that is using the same disk names.
50; ;00:06:47,174 --> 00:06:57,542; ;This is an enhancement over APM 2015 R1 where exposing to a host with conflicting disk names was blocked.
51; ;00:06:57,542 --> 00:07:01,071; ;That's the whole idea with enhanced expose.
52; ;00:07:01,071 --> 00:07:06,932; ;Now let's talk about the process of installing the Application Protection Manager applications.
53; ;00:07:06,932 --> 00:07:12,948; ;All this would come about after the Data Collector has been installed, right, it's going to be on a Windows box.
54; ;00:07:12,948 --> 00:07:20,073; ;APM can be downloaded as we've mentioned with other programs like this from the Knowledge Center.
55; ;00:07:20,073 --> 00:07:25,615; ;And you can contact the technical support team if you're not sure how to download the Data Collector.
56; ;00:07:25,615 --> 00:07:38,012; ;But once the Data Collector has been downloaded, you just simply double click on the Data Collector icon and that will bring up the Data Collector application.
57; ;00:07:38,012 --> 00:07:48,506; ;From there, the user clicks on the Go to Website and you'll see this screen that you're seeing here will show up.
58; ;00:07:48,506 --> 00:07:55,942; ;And then down in the lower right, the Application Protection Manager application shows up.
59; ;00:07:55,942 --> 00:08:02,350; ;The Application Protection Manager has got three different choices underneath here.
60; ;00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:12,949; ;I have the application itself, which as we know allows Oracle administrators to protect and recover their data without the help of a storage or server administrator.
61; ;00:08:12,949 --> 00:08:29,454; ;The APM application is included, remember, starting in Enterprise Manager 2015 R2 or the next iteration of Enterprise Manager being Dell Storage Manager 2016 R1 and above.
62; ;00:08:29,454 --> 00:08:37,884; ;Now the other things you see on there are Windows Client Installer and the Linux Agent Installer.
63; ;00:08:37,884 --> 00:08:48,940; ;Linux agents are installed on each Oracle server to be protected and they have to be registered with the Dell Storage Manager and the APM server.
64; ;00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:55,185; ;And of course, as we mentioned earlier, an APM license is required on the SC Series array.
65; ;00:08:55,185 --> 00:09:02,494; ;After it's installed, once you click on the program, it goes ahead and starts the Application Protection Manager.
66; ;00:09:02,494 --> 00:09:09,531; ;Now you're ready to run it and see the interface that we saw previously.
67; ;00:09:09,531 --> 00:09:11,884; ;Now let's talk about Replay Manager.
68; ;00:09:11,884 --> 00:09:17,899; ;And you can see these are the basic high-level steps involved with the Replay Manager.
69; ;00:09:17,899 --> 00:09:23,237; ;We'll get into some more details here in the next couple of slides, kind of drill down deeper.
70; ;00:09:23,237 --> 00:09:32,968; ;Request a snapshot, transaction pause because it works out with VSS, creates a consistent snapshot, then you resume normal operation.
71; ;00:09:32,968 --> 00:09:39,967; ;In this example you're seeing what we're showing here is every 15 minutes, it is doing this process.
72; ;00:09:39,967 --> 00:09:44,881; ;That's because the user said he wanted a snapshot every 15 minutes.
73; ;00:09:44,881 --> 00:09:59,574; ;As it says there, it ensures reliable, application-consistent, that's the key application-consistent backup and recovery of Microsoft Volume Shadow Copy VSS-enabled applications.
74; ;00:09:59,574 --> 00:10:05,875; ;That's going to be SQL Server, Exchange, and Hyper-V, and VMware virtual machines.
75; ;00:10:05,875 --> 00:10:08,094; ;We mentioned VMware virtual machines.
76; ;00:10:08,094 --> 00:10:17,439; ;For data protection in a virtual environment, Replay Manager supports backup and recovery of Microsoft applications running in a virtual machine.
77; ;00:10:17,439 --> 00:10:28,429; ;It will also support backup and recovery of Hyper-V and VMware VMs running on a direct guest iSCSI or a physical mode RDM mapping.
78; ;00:10:28,429 --> 00:10:42,473; ;One thing to note, the Replay Manager versions prior to version 7 only supported working with Microsoft's VSS if it was running on physical Windows servers, it didn't work with VMs.
79; ;00:10:42,473 --> 00:10:50,144; ;We're up to version 7.7, so it's been, you know, I want to say couple years at least since we've been supporting that.
80; ;00:10:50,144 --> 00:10:55,579; ;But older versions of Replay Manager only supported physical Windows hosts.
81; ;00:10:55,579 --> 00:11:03,756; ;In this slide, we'll take a look at what operating systems and applications are supported in Replay Manager specifically 7.7.
82; ;00:11:03,756 --> 00:11:15,274; ;Microsoft integrations, we have Microsoft Server for local volumes, Exchange Server, SQL Server, and Hyper-V.
83; ;00:11:15,274 --> 00:11:18,176; ;Then we'll get down, drill down a little bit deeper into those in a moment.
84; ;00:11:18,176 --> 00:11:24,625; ;VMware integrations, vCenter datastores, and vCenter virtual machines.
85; ;00:11:24,625 --> 00:11:38,014; ;And then as far as the Microsoft Windows Server's supported, that's 2008 and 2008 R2 both and core and full, and then 2012 and 2012 R2.
86; ;00:11:38,014 --> 00:11:41,694; ;Those are the Windows Servers that are supported.
87; ;00:11:41,694 --> 00:11:52,550; ;As far as Microsoft applications go, SQL Server 2008 and 2008 R2, SQL Server 2012 and 2014.
88; ;00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:59,124; ;Exchange Server 2007, 2010, and 2013.
89; ;00:11:59,124 --> 00:12:08,719; ;Hyper-V 2008, 2008 R2, and Hyper-V 2012 both core and full.
90; ;00:12:08,719 --> 00:12:14,283; ;And then Windows 2012 and 2012 R2 SMB file shares.
91; ;00:12:14,283 --> 00:12:18,646; ;That's the list of everything that's supported in Replay Manager 7.7.
92; ;00:12:18,646 --> 00:12:29,469; ;We're going to build out this diagram that's going to show a detailed flow of operations involved in creating shadow copies using the VSS functionality.
93; ;00:12:29,469 --> 00:12:33,269; ;Everything starts with the Replay Manager GUI, right?
94; ;00:12:33,269 --> 00:12:36,774; ;The schedule itself is created in the GUI.
95; ;00:12:36,774 --> 00:12:48,395; ;And then the Replay Manager will then issue a command based on when the snapshot was scheduled for to the VSS Requestor.
96; ;00:12:48,395 --> 00:12:51,645; ;That requestor resides in the OS on the server.
97; ;00:12:51,645 --> 00:12:54,366; ;And that will have it take a snapshot.
98; ;00:12:54,366 --> 00:13:00,962; ;The VSS Requestor communicates then with the VSS Writer to prepare for a snapshot.
99; ;00:13:03,633 --> 00:13:13,568; ;The VSS Writer commands the application to flush memory, prepare for a snapshot, and pause the IO.
100; ;00:13:13,568 --> 00:13:27,571; ;Then the VSS Provider instructs the Data Instant Replay, that program, to take a snapshot of the Dell volume on the SC Series.
101; ;00:13:27,571 --> 00:13:40,152; ;Then it notifies the VSS Provider, then goes out notifies the Requestor if that snapshot was successful or not.
102; ;00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:52,939; ;And then the VSS Requestor goes back and notifies Replay Manager of the new restore point or if the snapshot failed, it will tell the GUI that the snapshot failed.
103; ;00:13:52,939 --> 00:14:00,894; ;We just detailed the step-by-step process and how VSS works in a physical Windows host environment.
104; ;00:14:00,894 --> 00:14:06,153; ;Now let's take a look at that step-by-step process in a VMware environment.
105; ;00:14:06,153 --> 00:14:17,038; ;Taking the VM-consistent snapshots of VMs requires the use of this appliance right here called the CIT-V appliance.
106; ;00:14:17,038 --> 00:14:24,934; ;CIT-V stands for Compellent Integration Tools for the VMware.
107; ;00:14:24,934 --> 00:14:30,512; ;It all starts from the Replay Manager GUI.
108; ;00:14:30,512 --> 00:14:34,479; ;A snapshot schedule, of course, is created in the GUI.
109; ;00:14:34,479 --> 00:14:42,114; ;Replay Manager then issues the command to take a snapshot of a VM to the CIT-V appliance.
110; ;00:14:44,464 --> 00:14:52,650; ;The CIT-V then issues the command to vCenter to take a snapshot of a VM.
111; ;00:14:52,650 --> 00:15:03,156; ;The next step is the vCenter instructs the VMware Tools on the VM to prepare for a snapshot.
112; ;00:15:03,156 --> 00:15:12,092; ;The VMware Tools instructs the VM to pause IO on the VM file system and any VSS enabled applications.
113; ;00:15:12,092 --> 00:15:17,474; ;Typically that's going to be SQL or Exchange.
114; ;00:15:17,474 --> 00:15:26,691; ;VSS pauses IO on the application and prepares the VM to take a snapshot.
115; ;00:15:26,691 --> 00:15:35,085; ;Then the VM data is flushed and a delta VMDK file is created as the VMware snapshot is taken.
116; ;00:15:38,691 --> 00:15:52,117; ;CIT-V appliance then instructs the licensed Data Instant Replay to take a snapshot of the SC volume where the VMDK resides.
117; ;00:15:52,117 --> 00:15:58,907; ;This is now a VM-consistent and VSS-application consistent snapshot.
118; ;00:15:58,907 --> 00:16:05,693; ;The delta VMDK is not consistent, but can be used for added granular recovery purposes if needed.
119; ;00:16:09,819 --> 00:16:21,163; ;The VM and associated applications resume IO and vCenter is notified again of success or failure of the snapshot.
120; ;00:16:21,163 --> 00:16:32,042; ;The VMware snapshot is removed and changes stored in the VMDK are coalesced back into the original VMDK.
121; ;00:16:36,465 --> 00:16:48,780; ;vCenter then notifies the CIT-V appliance that the snapshot process is complete and then it finishes up, the CIT-V instructs Replay Manager to create a restore point.
122; ;00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:54,682; ;Or if it fails will tell the GUI, the Replay Manager GUI, that the snapshot failed.
123; ;00:16:54,682 --> 00:17:03,800; ;As we mentioned, at the time of this video, the Replay Manager 7.7 was the most current release of Replay Manager.
124; ;00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:08,364; ;And it included a couple of features, one being Resync.
125; ;00:17:08,364 --> 00:17:12,903; ;What Resync does, it allow for faster recovery from a restore point.
126; ;00:17:12,903 --> 00:17:17,033; ;It moves pointers instead of copying files, so it's a lot faster.
127; ;00:17:17,033 --> 00:17:26,478; ;The other thing Resync does, it resets the SC Series volume to the appropriate snapshot and will orphan all snapshots after it is taken.
128; ;00:17:26,478 --> 00:17:32,411; ;And then the last thing Resync does or last thing it is, it's now part of the Replay Manager interface.
129; ;00:17:32,411 --> 00:17:37,411; ;There are a few limitations in the interface at least as of 7.7.
130; ;00:17:37,411 --> 00:17:46,829; ;There's no Hyper-V and there's no restore points containing Cluster Shared Volumes or CSVs.
131; ;00:17:46,829 --> 00:17:51,416; ;There's no restore points containing SQL system databases.
132; ;00:17:51,416 --> 00:18:07,020; ;This functionality is only available on Windows 2008 R2 and higher, and it requires a Microsoft hotfix, it's a KB2877115, in order for the Resync to work.
133; ;00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:21,918; ;The other thing that released as part of Replay Manager 7.7 other than Resync is Replay Manager now supports front-end SAS connectivity on both the SCv2000 and the SC4020.
134; ;00:18:21,918 --> 00:18:31,691; ;The SC4020, remember, that functionality was just released as part of SCOS 7.1.
135; ;00:18:31,691 --> 00:18:40,803; ;So you'd have to have SCOS 7.1 running on that 4020 in order for Replay Manager 7.7 to work.
136; ;00:18:40,803 --> 00:18:47,544; ;But it is supported on both SCv2000 series models and SC4020.
137; ;00:18:47,544 --> 00:18:52,359; ;Let's go through a couple of review questions covering the slides we just covered.
138; ;00:18:52,359 --> 00:18:57,077; ;Our first question being what RAID levels are used in the SC Series?
139; ;00:18:57,077 --> 00:18:59,949; ;Remember those?
140; ;00:18:59,949 --> 00:19:06,752; ;Yeah, RAID 0, RAID 5, RAID 10, and then RAID 6 and RAID 10 dual mirror.
141; ;00:19:06,752 --> 00:19:08,464; ;Good.
142; ;00:19:08,464 --> 00:19:20,936; ;What is the default redundancy level in an SC7020 if the largest drive in tier 1 is a 1.6 terabyte write-intensive SSD?
143; ;00:19:20,936 --> 00:19:25,351; ;Remember that, remember we had that little table that we had?
144; ;00:19:25,351 --> 00:19:30,755; ;It is dual redundancy, right, given the size of the SSD drive itself.
145; ;00:19:30,755 --> 00:19:31,834; ;Good.
146; ;00:19:31,834 --> 00:19:42,151; ;What SC Series feature allows an administrator to select several related volumes and take a snapshot of all of them at the same time?
147; ;00:19:42,151 --> 00:19:44,688; ;We talked about that, yep, a consistent snapshot.
148; ;00:19:44,688 --> 00:19:46,135; ;Good.
149; ;00:19:46,135 --> 00:19:48,752; ;And then our last review question for now.
150; ;00:19:48,752 --> 00:19:58,724; ;What client server application creates and manages application-consistent snapshots for Oracle databases on an SC Series solution?
151; ;00:19:58,724 --> 00:20:01,314; ;We talked quite a bit about that, right?
152; ;00:20:01,314 --> 00:20:02,569; ;Good.
153; ;00:20:02,569 --> 00:20:05,833; ;Application Protection Manager or APM.
1; ;00:00:01,388 --> 00:00:04,589; ;Let's talk about another way of protecting data.
2; ;00:00:04,589 --> 00:00:07,156; ;This is through replication.
3; ;00:00:07,156 --> 00:00:15,826; ;We call the licensed functionality of replication, it's called Remote Data Instant Replay in the SC Series.
4; ;00:00:15,826 --> 00:00:23,094; ;Remember that the licensing for a snapshot is called Data Instant Replay.
5; ;00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:32,440; ;This is basically replication of snapshots or replays, so that's why the license feature is called Remote Data Instant Replay.
6; ;00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:38,050; ;But really it is replication as you would come to know it in the industry.
7; ;00:00:38,058 --> 00:00:43,274; ;Let's start our discussion of replication with a discussion question.
8; ;00:00:43,274 --> 00:00:47,030; ;Why would customers replicate their data?
9; ;00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:51,222; ;A couple of reasons.
10; ;00:00:51,222 --> 00:01:04,131; ;But one of them is to protect data off site, so in case of a disaster, you've got the data, the critical data especially, far enough away from that disaster, so the data is protected.
11; ;00:01:04,131 --> 00:01:15,337; ;Let's talk briefly about the comparison between Data Instant Replay, local snapshots, and Remote Instant Replay, replicated snapshots.
12; ;00:01:15,337 --> 00:01:19,587; ;These are the licensed terms for this functionality.
13; ;00:01:19,587 --> 00:01:27,080; ;Data Instant Replay, very space-efficient fast local data recovery.
14; ;00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:30,211; ;It captures only incremental changes.
15; ;00:01:30,211 --> 00:01:38,984; ;Especially, after that initial snapshot of a volume is taken then it's only incremental changes that need to be captured after that.
16; ;00:01:38,984 --> 00:01:49,736; ;These readable snapshots - remember they're frozen as read-only - so these readable snapshots are automatically stored on a lower-cost drives.
17; ;00:01:49,736 --> 00:01:58,749; ;And it can be used to recover any size volume to any server, and usually it's less than 10 seconds, so it's stored down in Tier 3.
18; ;00:01:58,749 --> 00:02:11,693; ;Remote Instant Replay then leverages these snapshots that we take locally between local and remote sites to deliver a cost-effective replication solution.
19; ;00:02:11,693 --> 00:02:24,556; ;After initial site synchronization, only incremental changes in data are replicated on an ongoing basis, so this is going to cut hardware, bandwidth, and administration cost.
20; ;00:02:24,556 --> 00:02:33,210; ;Your customer can replicate either over iSCSI or Fibre Channel, either approach is supported in the SC Series.
21; ;00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:41,244; ;Some of the benefits of Remote Instant Replay include the ability to replicate to multiple sites.
22; ;00:02:41,244 --> 00:02:55,090; ;And also, replications can be managed from a single pane of glass through the Dell Storage Manager, so it's a very straightforward easy management approach to handle your Remote Instant Replays.
23; ;00:02:55,090 --> 00:03:05,083; ;Some of the other benefits, I can create multiple online copies automatically and simultaneously at multiple sites.
24; ;00:03:05,083 --> 00:03:12,700; ;It brings off-site replication to companies that previously considered off-site replication too expensive or too complex.
25; ;00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:23,040; ;You can establish snapshot profiles that can be applied to selected volumes to support how often you want volumes replicated.
26; ;00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:28,139; ;Both local and remote site data volumes are active and available.
27; ;00:03:28,139 --> 00:03:31,549; ;Individual per-site configuration.
28; ;00:03:31,549 --> 00:03:35,826; ;We'll talk about the flexibility of setup in the next slide.
29; ;00:03:35,826 --> 00:03:41,641; ;I use both source and destination resources so I can replicate bi-directionally.
30; ;00:03:41,641 --> 00:03:45,494; ;Synchronous and asynchronous modes are supported, we'll talk more about that.
31; ;00:03:45,494 --> 00:03:50,809; ;Replications are created and managed as we said in DSM, Dell Storage Manager.
32; ;00:03:50,809 --> 00:03:59,492; ;And the Remote Instant Replay functionality is fully certified with VMware's Site Recovery Manager.
33; ;00:03:59,492 --> 00:04:08,041; ;The SC Series supports the use of multiple systems in a local site/remote site architecture in support of data replication.
34; ;00:04:08,041 --> 00:04:14,717; ;Very often, the source system is referred to as the replicating system and the destination as the target.
35; ;00:04:14,717 --> 00:04:21,484; ;So we've talked about Fibre Channel and iSCSI, it can be the connectivity between the sites.
36; ;00:04:21,484 --> 00:04:29,795; ;And FCoE as well, not all SC Series model support FCoE, so it kind of depends on which one.
37; ;00:04:29,795 --> 00:04:33,924; ;You see the four different replication topologies that are supported.
38; ;00:04:33,924 --> 00:04:40,936; ;One-way replication, where you just have a replicating system and the target or a DR system.
39; ;00:04:40,936 --> 00:04:47,403; ;Three-way replication topology, often referred to a circle topology, where I can replicate to all sites.
40; ;00:04:47,403 --> 00:04:52,471; ;Two-way replication topology where I can go in both directions, right?
41; ;00:04:52,471 --> 00:05:03,586; ;And then star topology where it's kind of a source data center, but I'm replicating out to the replication sites where the target systems as well as replicating back.
42; ;00:05:03,586 --> 00:05:12,258; ;All of these are supported and the beauty of it, very easy to manage all of these approaches in Dell Storage Manager.
43; ;00:05:12,258 --> 00:05:17,647; ;As we said, there are two different types of replication or supporters, synchronous and asynchronous.
44; ;00:05:17,647 --> 00:05:22,903; ;And we want to kind of walk through both of those for you, starting with synchronous.
45; ;00:05:22,903 --> 00:05:33,327; ;The idea with synchronous is I've got to write from the server here right to the local SC Series system.
46; ;00:05:33,327 --> 00:05:40,030; ;Now then that write goes across the pipe to the remote system.
47; ;00:05:40,030 --> 00:05:47,259; ;Then an acknowledgement comes back from that remote SC Series and that acknowledgement is then sent to the server.
48; ;00:05:47,259 --> 00:05:58,750; ;It's only when that whole process occurs, that the original write is acknowledged and it's actually written to the storage.
49; ;00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:03,397; ;As you might guess, this is got to be a pretty healthy pipe.
50; ;00:06:03,397 --> 00:06:09,089; ;It's typically when you see synchronous replication, it's generally Fibre Channel.
51; ;00:06:09,089 --> 00:06:12,094; ;It could be FCoE if that's supported.
52; ;00:06:12,094 --> 00:06:18,890; ;But generally it's going to be Fibre Channel and therefore the distance here is going to be pretty short.
53; ;00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:24,714; ;It's going to be generally in a data center environment, perhaps a campus environment.
54; ;00:06:24,714 --> 00:06:38,015; ;So this is generally synchronous is, it's not so much disaster recovery but it's just getting the data off of this system onto another system.
55; ;00:06:38,015 --> 00:06:46,066; ;With asynchronous replication, you still have obviously the same write coming from the host down to the local SC Series.
56; ;00:06:46,066 --> 00:06:56,904; ;But what happens then is the SC Series says, "Yep, all good. I got your write, I acknowledge that write, so you can give me some more data that I can transmit."
57; ;00:06:56,904 --> 00:07:02,864; ;So then that write occurs at an appropriate time.
58; ;00:07:02,864 --> 00:07:10,797; ;And then the acknowledgement is then handled between the systems, the local and the remote.
59; ;00:07:10,797 --> 00:07:16,976; ;The beauty of that of course is that system B can be basically anywhere, right?
60; ;00:07:16,976 --> 00:07:19,841; ;It doesn't have to be in the same data center.
61; ;00:07:19,841 --> 00:07:41,688; ;In fact, generally, it's asynchronous replication that's used for disaster recovery because this system could be across the country, maybe if the local system is in a hurricane zone for example, this could be in a non-hurricane zone, halfway across the country or across the country, what have you.
62; ;00:07:41,688 --> 00:07:50,014; ;So asynchronous replication is more often used for disaster recovery scenarios than synchronous replication.
63; ;00:07:50,014 --> 00:08:01,836; ;And these replications can be manually initiated or they can be automated through the use of that Remote Instant Replay functionality.
64; ;00:08:01,836 --> 00:08:14,155; ;When an administrator chooses to do a synchronous replication, he'll be prompted to choose either high availability or high consistency.
65; ;00:08:14,155 --> 00:08:24,012; ;The type of replication can be changed on the fly between asynchronous and synchronous still, and as well, high availability and high consistency can be changed on the fly.
66; ;00:08:24,012 --> 00:08:37,283; ;What happens is high availability allows writes to continue to the source volume if the connection to the remote DR volume is unavailable.
67; ;00:08:37,283 --> 00:08:42,764; ;This was an option that was released in SCOS 6.5.
68; ;00:08:42,764 --> 00:08:50,032; ;We're up to 7.1 so 6.5 is a couple years old now.
69; ;00:08:50,032 --> 00:08:59,961; ;It'll continue to write here from here to local even though we've lost the connection, that is considered high availability.
70; ;00:08:59,961 --> 00:09:12,656; ;The difference then with high consistency is that it stops writes to the source volume if this connection between the SC Series systems has been lost.
71; ;00:09:12,656 --> 00:09:23,637; ;And this is the way synchronous replication has worked in the SC Series from the beginning, prior to 6.5, I didn't have that high availability option back then.
72; ;00:09:23,637 --> 00:09:34,433; ;In either case, when the connection is restored, smart resynchronization resumes transferring snapshots and the active snapshot data from the source volume.
73; ;00:09:34,433 --> 00:09:37,983; ;So this eliminates the need to re-replicate the entire volume.
74; ;00:09:37,983 --> 00:09:43,791; ;And that's really the way it was prior to this version 6.5.
75; ;00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:52,585; ;Deduplication has helped out because it reduces the amount of data sent to the remote DR volumes.
76; ;00:09:52,585 --> 00:09:56,314; ;So only the changes within the snapshot are sent.
77; ;00:09:56,314 --> 00:10:04,226; ;And one other thing to note that high availability and high consistency are not supported on the SCv2000 controllers.
78; ;00:10:04,226 --> 00:10:13,381; ;Remember that the SCv2000, you can only do replication between models in the SCv2000 family.
79; ;00:10:13,381 --> 00:10:22,825; ;When replicating to another SC Series and this is going to be synchronously or asynchronously, but especially asynchronously.
80; ;00:10:22,825 --> 00:10:32,614; ;The bandwidth of the connection used is probably the most critical thing in terms of when those writes are going to get to the remote site.
81; ;00:10:32,614 --> 00:10:37,640; ;But there are some other factors that you have to consider when you're replicating data.
82; ;00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:40,225; ;How often will a volume be replicated?
83; ;00:10:40,225 --> 00:10:44,255; ;How many volumes will be replicated at any one time?
84; ;00:10:44,255 --> 00:10:48,312; ;What's the size of the volumes that are going to be replicated?
85; ;00:10:48,312 --> 00:10:50,613; ;How much change occurs in the volume?
86; ;00:10:50,613 --> 00:10:54,880; ;Because remember, we're replicating just the changes.
87; ;00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,776; ;What's the format of the data?
88; ;00:10:57,776 --> 00:11:03,318; ;And we've talked about not only the bandwidth of the link but also what's the quality of the link.
89; ;00:11:03,318 --> 00:11:06,424; ;What is the actual distance between the sites?
90; ;00:11:06,424 --> 00:11:14,262; ;And then the TCP window size if you're replicating asynchronously over IP.
91; ;00:11:14,262 --> 00:11:26,932; ;Remote Instant Replay requires a license, so both the source and the destination systems must be licensed for replication.
92; ;00:11:26,932 --> 00:11:34,047; ;Since replication involves more than one SC Series, a Data Collector is required.
93; ;00:11:34,047 --> 00:11:38,454; ;Both systems must be configured in Dell Storage Manager.
94; ;00:11:38,454 --> 00:11:44,589; ;Once added to DSM, a connection has to be established between the system.
95; ;00:11:44,589 --> 00:11:56,600; ;This can be either Fibre Channel, iSCSI or potentially a combination of the two, and depending on what system, potentially FCoE as well.
96; ;00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:14,423; ;Once replication is configured, the administrator can configure volumes to replicate, activate a disaster recovery site, and restart or recover to the source site if necessary in case of a true disaster.
97; ;00:12:14,423 --> 00:12:29,513; ;If you're replicating with SCv2000 series controllers, a couple of things that to be aware of, we mentioned this previously, but SCv2000 only replicate to other SCv2000 systems.
98; ;00:12:29,513 --> 00:12:41,934; ;A couple of things that are not supported, Live Volume, high availability and high consistency, which we just talked about, those are both options with synchronous replication.
99; ;00:12:41,934 --> 00:12:50,494; ;And replicating with portable volume, that's another option that's not available on an SCv2000 series.
1; ;00:00:01,347 --> 00:00:04,563; ;So the next few slides, we're going to talk about Encryption.
2; ;00:00:07,144 --> 00:00:17,528; ;As recent security breaches in both government and private sector environments continue to make headlines, organizations of all kinds are focusing on data protection.
3; ;00:00:17,528 --> 00:00:29,208; ;And one of the most promising, growing technologies for safeguarding information is a new generation of self-encrypting drives, or SEDs.
4; ;00:00:30,898 --> 00:00:41,216; ;These devices offer excellent data protection, even in cases where a drive or an entire array is physically stolen or lost.
5; ;00:00:41,216 --> 00:00:45,242; ;Drives removed from the system are automatically locked.
6; ;00:00:45,242 --> 00:00:50,922; ;And without their individual encryption keys, they remain 100% inaccessible.
7; ;00:00:50,922 --> 00:00:59,689; ;So even if the drive is disassembled and placed on a spin stand, you still can't read the data that's on that drive.
8; ;00:01:00,903 --> 00:01:09,850; ;Unlike software-based encryption schemes, SED security has zero impact on a system or application performance.
9; ;00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:18,077; ;What we're seeing is there's growing, these are all growing market segments for SEDs.
10; ;00:01:18,077 --> 00:01:28,202; ;The government sector, healthcare, retail, service providers, and financial institutions, all are looking for more and more security.
11; ;00:01:28,202 --> 00:01:35,347; ;The self-encrypting drives, that marketplace is getting huger and huger.
12; ;00:01:35,347 --> 00:01:43,399; ;Dell has found innovative ways to make this SED technology more affordable and practical for customers.
13; ;00:01:43,399 --> 00:02:00,441; ;While traditional solutions require customers to switch all their drives to SEDs, the SC Series' ability to support SED and non-SED drives in the same array lets customers adopt a pay-as-you-go approach to encryption.
14; ;00:02:00,441 --> 00:02:05,285; ;Secure drives may be deployed only for volumes that require encryption.
15; ;00:02:05,285 --> 00:02:12,415; ;It can be an incremental roll-out, there's no need to do a forklift upgrade just to install the SED drives.
16; ;00:02:12,415 --> 00:02:23,830; ;This is because separate page pools for locked and unlocked LUNs within the array provide complete separation and security, and this provides for that incremental roll-out.
17; ;00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:31,449; ;We support FIPS 140-2 Security Level 2 certification, and this is required by the government.
18; ;00:02:31,449 --> 00:02:37,055; ;This is a critical level of security that's supported with our drives.
19; ;00:02:37,055 --> 00:02:46,716; ;External key manager protects data against loss or theft of drives, enclosures or an entire array.
20; ;00:02:46,716 --> 00:02:58,967; ;Best of all, the SCOS version 6.5 software, so that's when this came out, and newer lets customers deploy SEDs in their existing SC Series arrays.
21; ;00:02:58,967 --> 00:03:07,977; ;We mentioned this earlier, but this is a contrast to many other vendors who do require a forklift upgrade to an entirely new array.
22; ;00:03:09,094 --> 00:03:15,266; ;Some of the things we support, data at rest encryption, DAR.
23; ;00:03:15,266 --> 00:03:30,842; ;And as we said, external key manager via the Key Management Interoperability Protocol version 1.0 - this is supported in all of our arrays except for the SCv2000 series.
24; ;00:03:30,842 --> 00:03:35,947; ;Starting in version 6.5 is when SED drives were supported.
25; ;00:03:35,947 --> 00:03:45,039; ;In 6.5, the only drives, the physical type of drives that were supported were spinning disks or HDDs.
26; ;00:03:45,039 --> 00:03:52,883; ;In SCOS version 6.7, we added support for SSDs or flash drives.
27; ;00:03:52,883 --> 00:04:04,323; ;Anything from 6.7 currently will support both SSDs and HDDs, they can all be SED compliant - they're all supported.
28; ;00:04:05,331 --> 00:04:13,312; ;In the SC Series, encryption is implemented in one of two ways, either storage-based or server-based.
29; ;00:04:13,312 --> 00:04:17,082; ;Let's start with talking about storage-based first.
30; ;00:04:17,082 --> 00:04:23,998; ;Storage-based methods use data at rest encryption on self-encrypting drives.
31; ;00:04:23,998 --> 00:04:37,878; ;As we said both HDDs and SSDs are supported in conjunction with the key management appliance, or a Key Management Server referred to as a KMS.
32; ;00:04:37,878 --> 00:04:45,424; ;Supported KMS providers include SafeNet KeySecure and Thales EMS.
33; ;00:04:45,424 --> 00:04:49,579; ;We're going to talk a little bit more about these in our next slide and give you a little bit more detail.
34; ;00:04:49,579 --> 00:04:54,677; ;The other type of encryption option that's supported is server-based encryption.
35; ;00:04:54,677 --> 00:04:58,530; ;This is used on non-SED drives.
36; ;00:04:58,530 --> 00:05:03,659; ;What's supported is data in flight.
37; ;00:05:03,659 --> 00:05:08,206; ;It can work on standard spinning disks as well as SSDs.
38; ;00:05:08,206 --> 00:05:14,013; ;And this works with encryption software plus Key Management.
39; ;00:05:14,013 --> 00:05:24,969; ;This works with SafeNet ProtectFile, as well as Vormetric, and we'll talk more about each of those in the next slide.
40; ;00:05:24,969 --> 00:05:39,687; ;SC Series array support a wide range of self-encrypted drives in both HDD and SSD, offering a trusted data-at-rest encryption solution that meets the most stringent compliance requirements.
41; ;00:05:39,687 --> 00:05:47,531; ;Leading remote key management platforms are supported, allowing customers to leverage their existing key management investments.
42; ;00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:59,839; ;The SC Series offers SEDs with leading key manager server solution providers on all of its major platforms.
43; ;00:05:59,839 --> 00:06:04,063; ;The only exception is going to be that SCv2000.
44; ;00:06:04,063 --> 00:06:13,819; ;One such KMS provider is SafeNet and their family of products is referred to as KeySecure.
45; ;00:06:15,653 --> 00:06:17,716; ;Now a little bit about SafeNet.
46; ;00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:26,040; ;They were founded in 1983 and they were acquired by a company called Gemalto in 2015.
47; ;00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:31,960; ;They offer three versions of the Key Manager Server.
48; ;00:06:31,961 --> 00:06:40,959; ;These are the K460, the K250, and the K150v.
49; ;00:06:40,959 --> 00:06:43,099; ;Just you can see the details there.
50; ;00:06:43,099 --> 00:06:49,752; ;A quick thumbnail would be the K460 is enterprise-level hardware appliance.
51; ;00:06:49,752 --> 00:07:00,975; ;The K250 is the mid-level hardware appliance, and the K150v is a version that supports low-cost key management, sort of entry level.
52; ;00:07:02,529 --> 00:07:08,994; ;And again, you can see kind of the differentiators in a little bit more detail there between all three.
53; ;00:07:08,994 --> 00:07:16,641; ;Another KMS provider company called Thales and they have their EMS solution.
54; ;00:07:16,641 --> 00:07:21,867; ;It shows here are the specifics of the EMS200 here.
55; ;00:07:21,867 --> 00:07:33,560; ;Thales e-Security is a leading global provider of data protection solutions with more than 40 years of experience securing the world's most sensitive information.
56; ;00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:44,288; ;Thales offers security hardened, tamper-resistant, the FIPS 140-2 level 3 certification in the EMS 200 model.
57; ;00:07:44,288 --> 00:07:54,011; ;And you can see some other attributes, I'm not going to speak to all those, but you can take a look at those and see some of the attributes of Thales EMS.
58; ;00:07:54,011 --> 00:07:59,504; ;The SC Series also offers host based encryption solution.
59; ;00:07:59,504 --> 00:08:06,468; ;This works with standard drives, so they're not necessarily SED drives, just regular drives.
60; ;00:08:06,468 --> 00:08:10,876; ;The solution is offered by a company called Vormetric.
61; ;00:08:10,876 --> 00:08:16,419; ;And their solution is called VTE, which stands Vormetric Transparent Encryption.
62; ;00:08:17,443 --> 00:08:27,255; ;So VTE provides a robust standard base platform for managing encryption keys from disparate sources across the enterprise.
63; ;00:08:27,255 --> 00:08:35,096; ;You can sort of see other features of Vormetrics, VTE in the list here on the slide.
64; ;00:08:36,124 --> 00:08:40,347; ;Let's finish up this module by going through a few more review questions.
65; ;00:08:41,833 --> 00:08:47,749; ;Starting with what two synchronous replication formats does the SC Series support?
66; ;00:08:47,749 --> 00:08:49,402; ;Do you remember that?
67; ;00:08:49,402 --> 00:08:50,408; ;Yep.
68; ;00:08:50,408 --> 00:08:53,012; ;High availability and high consistency.
69; ;00:08:54,124 --> 00:08:55,142; ;True or false.
70; ;00:08:55,142 --> 00:09:00,982; ;An SC 4020 system can replicate its data to any other SC Series solution.
71; ;00:09:02,337 --> 00:09:03,724; ;What do you think?
72; ;00:09:03,724 --> 00:09:05,347; ;Actually, false, isn't it?
73; ;00:09:05,347 --> 00:09:12,405; ;It can replicate to all the other models except an SCv2000 series model.
74; ;00:09:12,405 --> 00:09:13,418; ;Good.
75; ;00:09:13,418 --> 00:09:17,926; ;Which data encryption option requires only a Key Management Server?
76; ;00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:20,062; ;Remember that one?
77; ;00:09:21,549 --> 00:09:24,582; ;That's data-at-rest encryption.
78; ;00:09:24,582 --> 00:09:29,564; ;And finally, which data encryption option uses standard drives?
79; ;00:09:30,663 --> 00:09:33,284; ;It's on the last slide there. Data-in-flight encryption.
80; ;00:09:33,284 --> 00:09:39,352; ;So that's the difference between those two, data-at-rest and data-in-flight encryption.
1; ;00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:09,719; ;Okay, so in this section of the Data Protection training, we're going to cover an overview, the architecture, and capabilities of the Snapshots feature.
2; ;00:00:12,893 --> 00:00:17,214; ;So this slide depicts an overview of the feature.
3; ;00:00:17,214 --> 00:00:25,136; ;I first want to mention that the Snapshots are enabled with the Local Copies license.
4; ;00:00:25,136 --> 00:00:33,360; ;And a Snapshot is really just a point-in-time image or a space-efficient image of a data state of a storage resource.
5; ;00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:45,093; ;And the storage resource can be either a block-based LUN, a file system, or either of the VMware Datastores, VMFS Datastore and NFS Datastore.
6; ;00:00:45,093 --> 00:00:49,693; ;So Snapshots can be read-only or they can be read/write.
7; ;00:00:49,693 --> 00:00:53,737; ;And they're used for a variety of reasons.
8; ;00:00:55,012 --> 00:01:01,407; ;You can use them to restore data to the parent resource.
9; ;00:01:01,407 --> 00:01:16,138; ;For example, if a user deleted or accidentally corrupted a file, you could use the previous data state of the storage resource to recover that file.
10; ;00:01:16,138 --> 00:01:19,167; ;You can use it to perform data backups.
11; ;00:01:19,167 --> 00:01:21,646; ;They can also be used for data mining.
12; ;00:01:21,646 --> 00:01:30,810; ;If you're interested in testing applications, they can also be used for that.
13; ;00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:53,803; ;And another thing to be aware of are that Snapshots are dependent upon their parent storage resource, they're derived from it, if you will, so if anything has happened to the storage resource, the LUN, the file system, or the datastore, the Snapshot will become unreadable itself.
14; ;00:01:53,803 --> 00:01:59,663; ;So they're not to be thought of as mirrors or any form of disaster recovery protection.
15; ;00:01:59,663 --> 00:02:06,916; ;They just provide a form of local copy if you will.
16; ;00:02:08,868 --> 00:02:11,528; ;Now we'll talk a little bit about its architecture.
17; ;00:02:11,528 --> 00:02:19,261; ;And Snapshots on Unity are built upon a Redirect on Write architecture.
18; ;00:02:19,261 --> 00:02:24,632; ;And this architecture is different than some previous architectures that you may be aware of.
19; ;00:02:24,632 --> 00:02:29,847; ;There is a similar, an earlier architecture called Copy on First Write.
20; ;00:02:29,847 --> 00:02:40,344; ;And that had a performance problem when you changed existing data that the Redirect on Write architecture avoids.
21; ;00:02:40,344 --> 00:02:53,686; ;So when you take a Snapshot of a Unity storage resource, the view of the Snapshot is presented based on its existing data at that point in time.
22; ;00:02:53,686 --> 00:03:03,161; ;And it takes no additional storage to make that Snapshot initially, but to use the storage resource would require some additional storage which we'll see in a second here.
23; ;00:03:04,805 --> 00:03:14,091; ;The production data access would read existing data from that existing data structure shown on the diagram here.
24; ;00:03:14,091 --> 00:03:16,473; ;If the production data...
25; ;00:03:16,473 --> 00:03:34,175; ;If new data was written to that storage resource, a new 256 megabyte stripe is allocated from the parent pool that made the storage resource and the production data is written into that new stripe in 8K chucks if you will.
26; ;00:03:36,476 --> 00:03:44,531; ;New reads of any of those new writes are also accessed from that 256 megabyte stripe.
27; ;00:03:44,531 --> 00:03:48,070; ;And in a similar fashion, Snapshots can be writeable.
28; ;00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:55,177; ;So if you're writing to a Snapshot, again, another 256 megabytes stripe is allocated from the pool.
29; ;00:03:55,177 --> 00:03:59,886; ;And writes are written in those 8K chunks.
30; ;00:04:01,902 --> 00:04:09,377; ;Reads from those new writes are serviced from that newly allocated stripe as well.
31; ;00:04:11,213 --> 00:04:22,087; ;So we can see from this that if you're going to use Snapshots, they require pool space to make the new stripe allocation.
32; ;00:04:22,087 --> 00:04:42,289; ;And also another point to know, if you have a thick file system and you snap it, then as you write to that file system, it will start to take on thin file system performance traits because of all of the allocated 256 megabyte stripes.
33; ;00:04:44,999 --> 00:04:49,170; ;Okay, you can also take Snapshots of a LUN Consistency Group.
34; ;00:04:49,170 --> 00:04:59,624; ;And a Consistency Group is nothing more than a group of LUNs that operate together and are typically used by database applications from host.
35; ;00:05:01,643 --> 00:05:14,549; ;So when you take a Snapshot of a Consistency Group, any pending writes are allowed to continue until they complete.
36; ;00:05:14,549 --> 00:05:29,384; ;But any new writes are suspended on all the LUNs within the Consistency Group so that you get a write-ordered consistent snap of all of the LUNs within that Consistency Group.
37; ;00:05:29,384 --> 00:05:32,251; ;Now we'll talk about multiple Snapshots of a LUN.
38; ;00:05:33,523 --> 00:05:40,736; ;So you can have multiple shots of a LUN and they capture just different data states of that storage object, the LUN.
39; ;00:05:40,736 --> 00:05:45,341; ;And in this instance, we have a 3 o'clock Snapshot and a 4 o'clock Snapshot.
40; ;00:05:45,341 --> 00:05:51,178; ;And those snaps are children of a common parent.
41; ;00:05:51,178 --> 00:05:58,463; ;They take a different data state of a common LUN or resource.
42; ;00:06:00,199 --> 00:06:03,068; ;You can make copies of Snapshots.
43; ;00:06:03,068 --> 00:06:12,836; ;And when a copy of an existing snap is made, there is no difference between the two...
44; ;00:06:12,836 --> 00:06:19,558; ;In data state, in this example, the 4 o'clock snap had a copy made of it.
45; ;00:06:19,558 --> 00:06:24,977; ;Both of those Snapshots will have a data state of 4 o'clock.
46; ;00:06:24,977 --> 00:06:28,685; ;The only difference in them would be in their name.
47; ;00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:40,551; ;Also, for LUNs, multiple hosts can attach to a single Snapshot or to a Snapshot tree of a single LUN.
48; ;00:06:40,551 --> 00:06:50,331; ;And those Snapshots can be attached either in read-only or read/write for accessing the Snapshot itself as shown.
49; ;00:06:52,028 --> 00:07:02,071; ;When a LUN is attached in a read/write fashion, the system will mark that Snapshot as modified from its source.
50; ;00:07:02,071 --> 00:07:12,603; ;So if you're going to be writing data into that Snapshot, it will no longer have a 4 o'clock data state, and that's why it's marked as modified.
51; ;00:07:13,802 --> 00:07:26,255; ;You can hierarchically create copies of read/write Snapshots that are attached, and that can go down to a level of 10, maximum.
52; ;00:07:28,675 --> 00:07:48,471; ;So similar to the LUN Snapshot, you can have multiple Snapshots of a file system that just capture those different data states, that 3 o'clock Snapshot of a file system and a 4 o'clock data state of a file system, again, two children of a common parent.
53; ;00:07:51,161 --> 00:07:57,357; ;Snapshots on file systems are created either read/write or read-only.
54; ;00:07:58,759 --> 00:08:04,892; ;And you can take copies of Snapshots and they're always read/write.
55; ;00:08:04,892 --> 00:08:07,596; ;And read/write Snapshots are shareable.
56; ;00:08:07,596 --> 00:08:16,016; ;You can create a share to those objects and access them in a read/write fashion.
57; ;00:08:16,016 --> 00:08:24,517; ;And similar to the LUN Snapshot, you can have a hierarchy of read/write Snapshots up to a maximum of 10.
58; ;00:08:26,927 --> 00:08:30,893; ;Now some combined Snapshot capabilities.
59; ;00:08:30,893 --> 00:08:42,721; ;And here's a table that shows a variety of minimums and maximums of Snapshots based on the model of the Unity system.
60; ;00:08:42,721 --> 00:08:48,105; ;And some of these maximums are dependent upon each other.
61; ;00:08:48,105 --> 00:09:06,980; ;For example, we see that a Unity 300 or 350F can have a maximum 256 LUN Snapshots or 256 Snapshots of a single LUN and 256 Snapshots of a single file system.
62; ;00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:27,126; ;But if you had, for example, 20 LUNs and 20 file systems, you couldn't have 256 Snapshots of all of those LUNs and file systems because it would violate the maximum user Snapshots of 800 for that system.
63; ;00:09:27,126 --> 00:09:32,299; ;So there is a little bit of interaction between these capabilities.
64; ;00:09:33,899 --> 00:09:37,341; ;And that concludes the Snapshots overview.
65; ;00:09:37,341 --> 00:09:38,341; ;Thank you.
1; ;00:00:00,789 --> 00:00:09,944; ;All right, in this portion of the Data Protection training, we're going to cover replication, its overview, architecture, and capabilities.
2; ;00:00:09,944 --> 00:00:15,117; ;So here we see a diagram illustrating remote replication.
3; ;00:00:15,117 --> 00:00:19,650; ;It's brought to you via the Replication portion of the license.
4; ;00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:26,889; ;And it enables making complete replicas of storage objects on Unity.
5; ;00:00:26,889 --> 00:00:38,589; ;They can be block-based, LUNs, Consistency Groups, or VMFS datastores, or file-based files systems, NAS Servers, or NFS datastores.
6; ;00:00:38,589 --> 00:00:44,098; ;They're used for disaster recovery for the case of remote replication.
7; ;00:00:44,098 --> 00:00:55,253; ;We see a site A and site B, so we're replicating those objects to a wholly different Unity system at a different site.
8; ;00:00:55,253 --> 00:01:08,977; ;Therefore if the primary site, site A were to go down due to, we'll say, a natural disaster, you could bring production up on the remote system on site B.
9; ;00:01:08,977 --> 00:01:11,717; ;You can also use this for a planned downtime.
10; ;00:01:11,717 --> 00:01:30,214; ;If the site A needed maintenance, if there needed to be an electrical shutdown or communications updates, you could continue your production on the remaining site at site B.
11; ;00:01:30,214 --> 00:01:35,386; ;There are two forms of replication that Unity does.
12; ;00:01:35,386 --> 00:01:45,620; ;Asynchronous replication is possible on the file-based objects, the file systems, NAS Servers, and NFS datastores.
13; ;00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:57,850; ;Block-based objects, LUNs, Consistency Groups, and VMFS datastores can be asynchronously replicated or synchronously replicated.
14; ;00:01:57,850 --> 00:02:03,825; ;There is also an RPO value, it's a Recovery Point Objective.
15; ;00:02:03,825 --> 00:02:12,984; ;And that's an amount of data based on time that replication uses.
16; ;00:02:12,984 --> 00:02:18,758; ;Synchronous replication has an RPO of zero, it loses no data.
17; ;00:02:18,758 --> 00:02:26,626; ;Should, you know, one of those sites go down, the other site is going to be synchronized.
18; ;00:02:26,626 --> 00:02:33,029; ;The asynchronous RPO values can be as low as 5 minutes and as long as 24 hours.
19; ;00:02:36,618 --> 00:02:39,926; ;For asynchronous local replication, an overview.
20; ;00:02:39,926 --> 00:02:48,395; ;So basically, local replication just replicates an object from one pool to another within the same system.
21; ;00:02:48,395 --> 00:02:53,241; ;It has no disaster recovery use case for it whatsoever.
22; ;00:02:53,241 --> 00:03:06,375; ;If the site that had that Unity system, for example, burned to the ground, that Unity system would be totally gone and so would the data.
23; ;00:03:06,375 --> 00:03:10,903; ;So it has no disaster recovery use case.
24; ;00:03:10,903 --> 00:03:24,136; ;The use case for this would be maybe to move a storage resource from a pool that is overcapacity to one that has more capacity or maybe to change storage characteristics.
25; ;00:03:24,136 --> 00:03:37,497; ;Maybe pool A is made from performance disks and you want to move that storage resource to an archival type disk architecture like NL-SAS disks.
26; ;00:03:41,708 --> 00:03:52,679; ;So the architecture for asynchronous remote replication has sort of two major components, there's system connectivity and it uses snapshots.
27; ;00:03:52,679 --> 00:03:54,522; ;So we'll talk about the connectivity.
28; ;00:03:54,522 --> 00:04:10,695; ;Since we're replicating remotely, we have to communicate with the remote peer system, and that communications will form a data path for the replicated data and a management path.
29; ;00:04:10,695 --> 00:04:20,658; ;The replicated data will go over the replication interface, and the management will be on the replication connection.
30; ;00:04:20,658 --> 00:04:31,404; ;The architecture uses a pair of snapshots on the source system and a pair of snapshots on the destination system.
31; ;00:04:31,404 --> 00:04:39,111; ;And each system will have corresponding snapshot from source and destination.
32; ;00:04:39,111 --> 00:04:45,694; ;So there's a snapshot one on the source and a snapshot one on the destination.
33; ;00:04:45,694 --> 00:04:50,016; ;And likewise, a snapshot two and another snapshot two.
34; ;00:04:50,016 --> 00:04:56,980; ;And we'll talk a little bit about how those snapshots are used in a following slide.
35; ;00:05:01,251 --> 00:05:09,562; ;So local replication uses a similar architecture, the only thing different is there's no need to communicate with a peer system.
36; ;00:05:09,562 --> 00:05:17,105; ;So all the communications needed to manage the replication sessions is done internally.
37; ;00:05:17,105 --> 00:05:26,938; ;It uses the same pairs of snapshots for the source and destination object.
38; ;00:05:29,402 --> 00:05:32,509; ;So let's talk about the asynchronous replication process.
39; ;00:05:32,509 --> 00:05:34,778; ;It has an initial process.
40; ;00:05:34,778 --> 00:05:38,824; ;And once that's complete, then it has a synchronization process.
41; ;00:05:38,824 --> 00:05:53,934; ;So in this diagram, we're depicting asynchronous replication of a file system on site A, we've already established the communications, the data path, and the management path.
42; ;00:05:53,934 --> 00:06:07,383; ;So when you start replication, the replication process itself automatically creates the storage resource object on the destination.
43; ;00:06:07,383 --> 00:06:09,148; ;So it's automatically created.
44; ;00:06:09,148 --> 00:06:13,662; ;The snapshot pairs are also automatically created.
45; ;00:06:13,662 --> 00:06:16,588; ;So we see on the...
46; ;00:06:16,588 --> 00:06:30,356; ;I'm sorry, on the source system that those snapshots are created and they contain a data state current to the data state of the LUN that they're snapping.
47; ;00:06:30,356 --> 00:06:47,683; ;So basically what happens is that an initial copy goes on from the data state of the first snapshot on the source system to the destination object on the destination system.
48; ;00:06:47,683 --> 00:06:56,320; ;And that copy process can take a long time if there's a lot of data on that initial file system in this case.
49; ;00:06:56,320 --> 00:07:08,326; ;Once that copy operation is completed to the destination object, the corresponding snapshot on the destination will be updated.
50; ;00:07:08,326 --> 00:07:14,377; ;So snapshot one on the source and snapshot one on the destination will form a common base.
51; ;00:07:14,377 --> 00:07:18,320; ;They have the same data state at this point.
52; ;00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:32,276; ;So while that initial copy was going on, the source object, the source file system would have been under IO load and its data state is now changed from what was captured in the initial snapshot.
53; ;00:07:32,276 --> 00:07:40,643; ;So snapshot two on the source system is updated to capture the data state.
54; ;00:07:40,643 --> 00:07:45,261; ;A delta is calculated between the two snapshots on the source site.
55; ;00:07:45,261 --> 00:08:01,556; ;And that delta is copied from the second snapshot on the source to the destination storage resource, the destination file system in this case.
56; ;00:08:01,556 --> 00:08:20,105; ;Once that copy is complete, the second snapshot on the destination is updated, so snapshot two on the source and snapshot two on the destination are equal in data state.
57; ;00:08:20,105 --> 00:08:28,175; ;And now that process just continues alternating between the two pairs of snapshot.
58; ;00:08:28,175 --> 00:08:38,900; ;So now snapshot one will be used to update, a delta will be calculated, the delta will be copied and so on and so forth.
59; ;00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:45,138; ;And this is all based upon the RPO value that's set on the replication session.
60; ;00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:52,992; ;So let's now talk about synchronous replication and its architecture.
61; ;00:08:52,992 --> 00:08:54,654; ;It's slightly different.
62; ;00:08:54,654 --> 00:08:58,719; ;It does require the communications.
63; ;00:08:58,719 --> 00:09:00,380; ;It doesn't use snapshot pairs.
64; ;00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:04,936; ;It uses Write Intent Logs, and we'll talk a little bit about those.
65; ;00:09:04,936 --> 00:09:16,709; ;So the data connection between the two systems in synchronous replication is formed over Fibre Channel connections.
66; ;00:09:16,709 --> 00:09:20,862; ;That's a big difference between asynchronous and synchronous.
67; ;00:09:20,862 --> 00:09:26,124; ;The data connection on synchronous replication is always on Fibre Channel connections.
68; ;00:09:26,124 --> 00:09:31,604; ;There is a management connection that's formed.
69; ;00:09:31,604 --> 00:09:34,993; ;And that's on the replication connection.
70; ;00:09:34,993 --> 00:09:45,574; ;So the Write Intent Logs, those are small LUNs, one on SPA, one on SPB on both the source and destination.
71; ;00:09:45,574 --> 00:10:02,092; ;And their purpose is to track changes to the source LUN that are owed to the destination LUN should the secondary LUN become unavailable.
72; ;00:10:02,092 --> 00:10:14,633; ;And they're used so that you don't have to do a full synchronization again if connectivity is lost between source and destination systems.
73; ;00:10:17,431 --> 00:10:21,217; ;All right, let's talk about synchronous replication process.
74; ;00:10:21,217 --> 00:10:25,436; ;It has an initial process and then a synchronization process.
75; ;00:10:25,436 --> 00:10:32,208; ;So we'll start with a LUN that has some amount of data on it.
76; ;00:10:32,208 --> 00:10:47,433; ;And we start replication and the system will automatically create the destination resource object, in this case, a LUN of the exact same size as the source.
77; ;00:10:47,433 --> 00:10:54,478; ;The Write Intent Logs are then created on both systems.
78; ;00:10:54,478 --> 00:11:00,987; ;Write Intent Log for SPA and SPB on source and destination.
79; ;00:11:00,987 --> 00:11:05,176; ;Then an initial copy takes place.
80; ;00:11:05,176 --> 00:11:12,644; ;And this initial copy can take some amount of time to complete.
81; ;00:11:12,644 --> 00:11:20,278; ;And during the initial copy, the destination object would be unusable.
82; ;00:11:20,278 --> 00:11:27,188; ;It cannot be accessed or attached to by any host.
83; ;00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:48,401; ;So now after that initial copy, if data is written to the source LUN, the source system will not send an acknowledgement back to the host for that write operation.
84; ;00:11:48,401 --> 00:11:54,902; ;It will first send the write over to the destination system.
85; ;00:11:54,902 --> 00:12:10,551; ;That destination system, once that write is secured in cache and to disk, it will then send an acknowledgement to the source system that the write is secure.
86; ;00:12:10,551 --> 00:12:16,701; ;And the source system will then send a write acknowledgement to the host.
87; ;00:12:16,701 --> 00:12:28,270; ;And now we can understand from this that the source object and the destination object are in sync with each other.
88; ;00:12:28,270 --> 00:12:33,944; ;So the RPO value for synchronous replication is zero.
89; ;00:12:33,944 --> 00:12:53,228; ;If the site A system went down in the middle of this, the write would never have been acknowledged to the host and, you know, both objects would be considered in sync with each other.
90; ;00:12:54,746 --> 00:13:11,374; ;The Write Intent Logs, they are tracking changes if the destination system is unreachable and when the destination becomes available again will automatically resynchronize those objects.
91; ;00:13:15,146 --> 00:13:21,320; ;Synchronous replication states, so there are session states, and there are sync states.
92; ;00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:28,364; ;So the session states would be active, paused, failed over, lost sync communications.
93; ;00:13:28,364 --> 00:13:32,907; ;The sync states are in sync, syncing, out of sync, consistent, and inconsistent.
94; ;00:13:32,907 --> 00:13:40,073; ;So depending upon the session state, the sync state can vary.
95; ;00:13:40,073 --> 00:13:48,169; ;So if the session state is active, the sync state would be in sync.
96; ;00:13:48,169 --> 00:13:56,937; ;And there are a variety of sync states that can occur during other session states.
97; ;00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:04,501; ;Now we'll talk about the asynchronous replication capabilities.
98; ;00:14:04,501 --> 00:14:16,932; ;This table shows basically the maximum sessions, objects to replicate based on Unity model.
99; ;00:14:16,932 --> 00:14:24,497; ;And for the most part, the more powerful your Unity system, the more replication you can do.
100; ;00:14:26,251 --> 00:14:32,462; ;Likewise, there is a synchronous replication capabilities table.
101; ;00:14:32,462 --> 00:14:35,626; ;And again, those are the values.
102; ;00:14:38,691 --> 00:14:45,168; ;And that concludes the overview, architecture, and capabilities for replication.
1; ;00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,160; ;Welcome to the Unity system administration training.
2; ;00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:08,700; ;My name is Carlos Leite and I will be the instructor for this section of the course.
3; ;00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:14,960; ;In this section I will be covering the different interfaces used to manage and monitor the Unity storage system;
4; ;00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:23,530; ;The full Unity system access account and the roles that can be attributed to a custom user to access the system.
5; ;00:00:23,530 --> 00:00:30,330; ;I also cover in this section our event notifications and alerts, used for identifying system issues.
6; ;00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:37,000; ;The topics in this section have been broken into small chunks in different formats which include video demonstrations.
7; ;00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:46,730; ;As the topics are consumed, please keep in mind how these can provide the proper input for system design aspects of performance, capacity and resilience.
8; ;00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:50,360; ;So let's get started.
1; ;00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,160; ;Welcome to the Unity system administration training.
2; ;00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:08,700; ;My name is Carlos Leite and I will be the instructor for this section of the course.

6; ;00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:37,000; ;The topics in this section have been broken into small chunks in different formats which include video demonstrations.
7; ;00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:46,730; ;As the topics are consumed, please keep in mind how these can provide the proper input for system design aspects of performance, capacity and resilience.
8; ;00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:50,360; ;So let's get started.
1; ;00:00:00,644 --> 00:00:09,621; ;(Speaker One) Okay, so as I mentioned, we just wanna hear about your experiences, nothing you say will affect your status with the Uber or your driver account.
2; ;00:00:09,621 --> 00:00:15,654; ;I have no connection to your driver account, so I really just want you to be open and honest, there's no right answer.
3; ;00:00:15,654 --> 00:00:20,067; ;I really just wanna know your honest feedback, so feel free to say anything good or bad.
4; ;00:00:20,067 --> 00:00:22,399; ;You could say you hate Uber, whatever you want, okay?
5; ;00:00:24,027 --> 00:00:30,845; ;And as I mentioned, we're audio recording and there will be no personal identifiable information connected to this.
6; ;00:00:30,845 --> 00:00:35,919; ;So first, I just kind of wanna start out like general questions about driving with Uber.
7; ;00:00:35,919 --> 00:00:40,079; ;So how did you start driving with Uber?
8; ;00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:42,951; ;How did you decide? Why did you choose to drive for Uber?
9; ;00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:56,845; ;(Speaker Two) My sister was an Uber driver and she asked me if I could use her sign-up link so she could get the referral bonus.
10; ;00:00:56,845 --> 00:00:59,049; ;And during the course of the time for driving, I would...
11; ;00:00:59,049 --> 00:01:08,076; ;My original plan was to do the 100 rides and stop, but a lot of people would get in the car and say things like, "If it wasn't for Uber I would be driving home drunk now."
12; ;00:01:09,288 --> 00:01:10,993; ;And a lot of people say things.
13; ;00:01:13,306 --> 00:01:24,494; ;It was evident that they would be driving to detriment themselves I guess and that really made me to believe in the platform so I decided to stick with it.
14; ;00:01:24,494 --> 00:01:27,137; ;(Speaker One) And how long have you been driving with Uber?
15; ;00:01:27,137 --> 00:01:31,669; ;(Speaker Two) I think I've been driving with Uber now for 14 or 15 months.
16; ;00:01:31,669 --> 00:01:32,901; ;(Speaker One) Wow. Okay.
17; ;00:01:32,901 --> 00:01:35,501; ;(Speaker Two) Well, probably 1300 rides in.
18; ;00:01:35,501 --> 00:01:36,548; ;(Speaker One) Cool.
19; ;00:01:37,813 --> 00:01:45,501; ;Can you tell me maybe one or two things that you really like about driving with Uber and then one or two things that you really dislike about driving with Uber?
20; ;00:01:45,501 --> 00:01:46,861; ;You can start with either one.
21; ;00:01:51,893 --> 00:01:59,606; ;(Speaker Two) It's not so much dislike in driving with Uber, just the way certain things are set up like for example, the promotions... (Speaker One) Yup.
22; ;00:02:00,613 --> 00:02:08,002; ;(Speaker Two) Like I could do a whole bunch of rides that are short and get the promotion and choose to decline rides that are far. (Speaker One) Right.
23; ;00:02:09,035 --> 00:02:14,800; ;(Speaker Two) I think it would be awesome if they implemented some kind of distance as well with the promotions.
24; ;00:02:18,067 --> 00:02:33,806; ;Another thing, it's not so much driving with Uber, again, I really enjoy it, I like to drive so it works well, but sometimes you get to run around with support like they will give you the same answer and same answer, and you will call back and they will give you the same answer.
25; ;00:02:33,806 --> 00:02:38,206; ;And to me, it's obvious they are reading from a script. (Speaker One) Right.
26; ;00:02:38,206 --> 00:02:45,002; ;(Speaker Two) I just wish that support would be more receptive to your problem rather than trying to find what to say on the paper.
27; ;00:02:45,002 --> 00:03:01,342; ;You know, but what I love driving with Uber is, I can set my own hours, I can make as much or as little as I need to make, and I love that you can cash out whenever you need.
28; ;00:03:01,342 --> 00:03:06,876; ;We don't have... I'm a student as well so it helps with the tuition and books.
29; ;00:03:06,876 --> 00:03:10,194; ;And if I needed a book this week, I don't have to wait for a paycheck, you know?
30; ;00:03:10,194 --> 00:03:12,166; ;(Speaker One) Right, that makes sense.
31; ;00:03:12,166 --> 00:03:28,226; ;(Speaker Two) And what I really, really love is it seems now especially with the 180 days of change, they're doing a lots to, I guess, cultivate a relationship with the drivers rather than their drivers being...
32; ;00:03:28,226 --> 00:03:38,511; ;Before it felt like the drivers were a part of the company but a separate entity and we were kinda left in the wind, but now it seems to be changing and I really appreciate that.
33; ;00:03:38,511 --> 00:03:39,529; ;(Speaker One) Cool.
34; ;00:03:39,529 --> 00:03:48,005; ;Okay, can you tell me kind of about like do you have a typical driving schedule that you stick to or do you mix it up every week?
35; ;00:03:49,634 --> 00:04:01,333; ;(Speaker Two) Normally on the weekends, I'll probably drive more consistently like I like to drive in Berkley, it's a good spot, but really it's kind of about the way or whatever my class schedules are.
36; ;00:04:01,333 --> 00:04:02,360; ;(Speaker One) Okay.
37; ;00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:08,789; ;And would you say how many days in a week would you drive and how many hours a day typically?
38; ;00:04:10,272 --> 00:04:21,652; ;(Speaker Two) Now when you say hours driving, is it like, logged in? 'cause like I noticed with the trend with me, it's like if I have a far trip, I'll log off till I get to my area of operation.
39; ;00:04:21,652 --> 00:04:22,819; ;(Speaker One) Got you.
40; ;00:04:22,819 --> 00:04:27,197; ;Yeah, just some general... How long do you spend driving?
41; ;00:04:27,197 --> 00:04:34,655; ;(Speaker Two) I think maybe I'll probably spend altogether maybe, 35 to 40 hours a week with Uber.
42; ;00:04:34,655 --> 00:04:35,667; ;(Speaker One) Yup. (Speaker Two) Yeah.
43; ;00:04:35,667 --> 00:04:38,964; ;(Speaker One) And do you drive every day? Do you take some days off?
44; ;00:04:41,259 --> 00:04:44,140; ;(Speaker Two) I definitely don't drive every day, so maybe I'll take like a week off.
45; ;00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:45,739; ;(Speaker One) Yup, cool.
46; ;00:04:48,227 --> 00:05:00,169; ;So you kind of mentioned this about how you can drive around your class schedule, so do you find that flexibility of deciding when you drive a good thing or do you find it challenging?
47; ;00:05:03,033 --> 00:05:04,054; ;(Speaker Two) A little of both.
48; ;00:05:04,054 --> 00:05:14,112; ;You can totally choose to slack off and not work but I think that's one of the biggest draws of why drivers stay with Uber.
49; ;00:05:14,112 --> 00:05:21,956; ;(Speaker One) Can you tell me more about kind of like it's challenging because you can, you know, no one says you have to be here at a certain time and how you can kind of slack off.
50; ;00:05:21,956 --> 00:05:26,685; ;Can you tell me anything more about that like what's your thought process really like when you are like, "I don't know if I really wanna drive today."
51; ;00:05:26,685 --> 00:05:45,342; ;(Speaker Two) It's kind of like a, super procrastination and telling, you're like I'll just make it up tomorrow, you know, which is really detrimental to like my personal clients, you know, so sometimes, I have to really kick myself to get in the car. Speaker one) Yeah.
52; ;00:05:45,342 --> 00:05:48,086; ;(speaker Two) And it's not like I'll do this on the days that I drive.
53; ;00:05:48,086 --> 00:05:53,184; ;I don't drive for Uber but also go driving and it's like, "Dude, I could be making some cash right now."
54; ;00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:55,912; ;Yeah.
55; ;00:05:55,912 --> 00:05:56,922; ;(Speaker One) Okay.
56; ;00:05:56,922 --> 00:05:58,331; ;(Speaker Two) Does that answer your question? (Speaker One) Yeah.
57; ;00:06:00,299 --> 00:06:05,177; ;So how much longer do you anticipate you'll be driving with Uber?
58; ;00:06:07,914 --> 00:06:13,303; ;(Speaker Two) At least probably two and a half years more when I finish my undergraduate degree.
59; ;00:06:13,303 --> 00:06:15,345; ;(Speaker One) And what is your major?
60; ;00:06:15,345 --> 00:06:17,804; ;(Speaker Two) I'm majoring in computer sciences in engineering.
61; ;00:06:17,804 --> 00:06:19,327; ;(Speaker One) Awesome.
62; ;00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:25,800; ;Okay, so anything that would make you more or less likely to continue driving with Uber?
63; ;00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:42,171; ;(Speaker Two) Definitely, there's things that would make it more likely to drive with Uber but unless there's some cash traffic thing in the news, I don't think I would stop.
64; ;00:06:42,707 --> 00:06:45,551; ;(Speaker One) What would make you more likely to continue driving with Uber?
65; ;00:06:47,519 --> 00:06:49,437; ;(Speaker Two) If they just implement different things.
66; ;00:06:49,437 --> 00:06:58,249; ;If Uber just implemented different things for drivers and I think the biggest thing is holding riders more accountable.
67; ;00:06:58,249 --> 00:07:10,304; ;Like I've gotten trips where riders had like three star rating and I'm wondering how they're still on the platform 'cause I thought bad ratings would get riders banned as well, at least that was my understanding.
68; ;00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:20,281; ;(Speaker One) So there's sometimes like dealing with challenging riders, something that makes you not like driving with Uber that much.
69; ;00:07:20,281 --> 00:07:25,383; ;(Speaker Two) Oh, it has nothing to do with Uber, just people in general like I said.
70; ;00:07:25,383 --> 00:07:33,668; ;But in my experience at least driving with Uber like I have done almost 1500 rides, I probably only have four or five bad ones.
71; ;00:07:33,668 --> 00:07:36,387; ;Just seems like the bad ones stand out more than some... (Speaker One) Yeah.
72; ;00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:39,337; ;Okay, that makes sense.
73; ;00:07:41,261 --> 00:07:49,427; ;So you kind of mentioned this like, that you can get cash to pay for tuition or books, so would you say driving for Uber like helps you make ends meet?
74; ;00:07:49,427 --> 00:07:50,642; ;Is this your source of income?
75; ;00:07:50,642 --> 00:07:52,391; ;(Speaker Two) Definitely, yeah.
76; ;00:07:52,391 --> 00:08:05,271; ;I mean, ends meet, even if I'm super on budget from my normal gigs and things, it gives me my take on life 'cause I think that's important.
77; ;00:08:05,271 --> 00:08:08,659; ;(Speaker One) So do you do other things to make money other than driving with Uber?
78; ;00:08:08,659 --> 00:08:09,950; ;(Speaker Two) Yeah, I do.
79; ;00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:13,741; ;A telecom job, so I do like a network infrastructure and things.
80; ;00:08:13,741 --> 00:08:14,760; ;(Speaker One) Cool.
81; ;00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:21,457; ;And what do you say like you do that 50% of the time and drive with Uber 50% of the time or how?
82; ;00:08:21,457 --> 00:08:27,744; ;(Speaker Two) Oh no, it's probably it's like Uber is 95% of the time and then the other job is kind of when it comes.
83; ;00:08:27,744 --> 00:08:29,229; ;(Speaker One) Got you. That makes sense.
84; ;00:08:30,286 --> 00:08:35,200; ;So what do you think you would be doing if you weren't driving with Uber?
85; ;00:08:37,417 --> 00:08:42,463; ;(Speaker Two) That's hard, I don't know, It's a...
86; ;00:08:47,037 --> 00:08:53,389; ;Probably more units in school but I don't think I would be doing anything for work specifically.
87; ;00:08:54,541 --> 00:09:03,849; ;Maybe I would try harder at my telecom job 'cause in that job, I kind of get like large lump sums when I finish but...
88; ;00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:09,819; ;Yeah, I'm kind of like trying to focus on school mostly.
89; ;00:09:09,819 --> 00:09:14,299; ;So I don't think I would be doing as far as employment probably.
90; ;00:09:14,299 --> 00:09:16,612; ;(Speaker One) So you'll just be more like a full time student.
91; ;00:09:16,612 --> 00:09:18,006; ;(Speaker Two) Yeah, definitely.
92; ;00:09:18,006 --> 00:09:20,844; ;Definitely relying more on student loans.
93; ;00:09:20,844 --> 00:09:22,122; ;(Speaker One) Right.
94; ;00:09:22,122 --> 00:09:27,131; ;So do you feel like driving with Uber makes it so you don't have to rely so much on student loans?
95; ;00:09:27,131 --> 00:09:28,405; ;(Speaker Two) Oh, definitely, yeah.
96; ;00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:34,823; ;My first year and half going back to school, I've been loan free because of Uber.
97; ;00:09:34,823 --> 00:09:36,069; ;So I really appreciate it.
98; ;00:09:36,069 --> 00:09:37,091; ;(Speaker One) Cool.
99; ;00:09:38,648 --> 00:09:43,539; ;Okay, so other than making money from driving with Uber...
100; ;00:09:45,647 --> 00:09:50,579; ;Do you think there's any other benefits with driving with Uber that you feel you received?
101; ;00:09:50,579 --> 00:09:52,248; ;(Speaker Two) Sure.
102; ;00:09:52,248 --> 00:09:56,104; ;One thing is I really enjoy meetings lots of people.
103; ;00:09:57,107 --> 00:10:06,425; ;I was kind of at a point where my life was not liking people I guess, so I was always playing video games at home if I'm not doing homework or things.
104; ;00:10:07,902 --> 00:10:10,013; ;So that's really helped me a lot in that regard.
105; ;00:10:11,238 --> 00:10:13,838; ;And then seeing people's kindness is awesome.
106; ;00:10:13,838 --> 00:10:22,492; ;And also I find awesome places to go to that I never knew existed because I'm either picking up or dropping off at these places.
107; ;00:10:22,492 --> 00:10:24,948; ;(Speaker One) Right, it's like places you might never drive on your own.
108; ;00:10:24,948 --> 00:10:26,242; ;(Speaker Two) Right.
109; ;00:10:26,242 --> 00:10:31,771; ;Little like, I don't know, places to eat or things like that, you know.
110; ;00:10:31,771 --> 00:10:33,653; ;(Speaker One) Cool. Okay.
111; ;00:10:33,653 --> 00:10:45,125; ;So one of the reasons we wanted to talk to you specifically is because you got a criminal record when you signed up to drive for the Uber, so we just kind of want to talk to you and learn kind of like what that experience was like?
112; ;00:10:47,172 --> 00:10:54,580; ;So first I want to know how did you know you were able to drive with Uber even with a criminal record?
113; ;00:10:55,665 --> 00:10:58,517; ;(Speaker Two) I didn't, that was kind of just like sign up and see what happens.
114; ;00:10:58,517 --> 00:10:59,852; ;(Speaker One) and it worked? (Speaker Two) Yeah.
115; ;00:11:02,275 --> 00:11:06,301; ;At the same time, I don't, yeah, I guess that was it.
116; ;00:11:06,301 --> 00:11:12,631; ;(Speaker One) So you never like heard that you're able to drive with Uber with a criminal record like before you signed up?
117; ;00:11:12,631 --> 00:11:13,659; ;You didn't know that was like a thing that Uber did?
118; ;00:11:13,659 --> 00:11:15,819; ;(Speaker Two) No, I didn't know that was a thing. (Speaker One) Okay.
119; ;00:11:15,819 --> 00:11:21,112; ;(Speaker Two) And I was just assuming for like what I was charged with it wasn't really a huge thing.
120; ;00:11:21,112 --> 00:11:24,470; ;Like it was annoying phone calls is what I got in trouble for. (Speaker One) Yeah.
121; ;00:11:25,503 --> 00:11:30,898; ;(Speaker Two) So I figured it wasn't like assault or murder or something like that, you know?
122; ;00:11:30,898 --> 00:11:36,318; ;(Speaker One) So when you signed up, you were expecting that you would pass everything and you'd be able to drive?
123; ;00:11:36,318 --> 00:11:37,940; ;(Speaker Two) Well, honestly, I wasn't sure.
124; ;00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:40,357; ;It was like let's see kind of see what happens. (Speaker One) Yeah.
125; ;00:11:40,357 --> 00:11:46,693; ;(Speaker Two) But I was banking on, you know, I didn't do something super horrible so maybe it will go through. (Speaker One) Yeah.
126; ;00:11:46,693 --> 00:11:50,029; ;So how did you feel when it came back and now you are...
127; ;00:11:50,029 --> 00:11:51,043; ;(Speaker Two) I was happy.
128; ;00:11:52,046 --> 00:11:55,774; ;It's definitely a shocker when you get your background checked and it says you are a criminal.
129; ;00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:01,348; ;But yeah, it was a good experience over all.
130; ;00:12:01,348 --> 00:12:02,378; ;(Speaker One) Yeah?
131; ;00:12:03,523 --> 00:12:12,228; ;(Speaker Two) And one surprise though 'cause the background check said like Interpol world tourist watch lists and things and was like, "Whoa, they really go in-depth in checking these people out."
132; ;00:12:16,628 --> 00:12:21,621; ;(Speaker One) So did, you said you were kind of a student and if you weren't driving for Uber, you'd focus on being student.
133; ;00:12:21,621 --> 00:12:26,795; ;But before you signed up to drive with Uber, did you try to get any other sort of employment?
134; ;00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:37,464; ;(Speaker Two) Just like, I have a degree in mechanic work, so I just do odd jobs here and there like mobile oil changes or brake jobs and things, and that really helped.
135; ;00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:47,925; ;But the whole reason I changed my degree is 'cause I hate doing that as a job, it's more of a hobby, so Uber helps a lot.
136; ;00:12:50,484 --> 00:12:59,052; ;(Speaker One) So, can you tell me what it was like for you after you got, what you were charged with?
137; ;00:12:59,052 --> 00:13:00,069; ;(Speaker Two) What do you mean?
138; ;00:13:00,069 --> 00:13:08,243; ;(Speaker One) Like so, after you had your criminal conviction like you went through like how did you feel about it?
139; ;00:13:08,243 --> 00:13:11,978; ;Did it change your life in anyway or so it just kind of like went back to normal?
140; ;00:13:13,449 --> 00:13:15,129; ;(Speaker One) Definitely didn't go back to normal.
141; ;00:13:17,151 --> 00:13:20,834; ;As cushy as it is, I totally felt like I got hosed in the case.
142; ;00:13:21,998 --> 00:13:26,205; ;And it was either spending more time in jail or just plead guilty, so I pled out.
143; ;00:13:29,554 --> 00:13:32,752; ;I guess I was angry at the system for a long time.
144; ;00:13:32,752 --> 00:13:34,453; ;It's like...
145; ;00:13:34,453 --> 00:13:36,581; ;But, you know, I'm over it.
146; ;00:13:36,581 --> 00:13:43,631; ;People mess up, people change, hopefully, change and grow and, yeah.
147; ;00:13:43,631 --> 00:13:57,586; ;(Speaker One) So do you think it like you said it like made you angry, do you think it like affected your life in any way after like was it hard coming back into your normal like social circles or family after that happened?
148; ;00:14:01,341 --> 00:14:13,885; ;(Speaker Two) I guess reintegrating back in with non-criminals was kind of hard because even though may be they don't know what happened, you, at least I held that shame for a long time.
149; ;00:14:13,885 --> 00:14:17,573; ;"I became a criminal now, and what are people gonna think of me."
150; ;00:14:17,573 --> 00:14:30,397; ;I mean it took a long time to get to the mindset where like I know I'm a pretty decent guy and I screwed all those things I guess, yeah.
151; ;00:14:30,397 --> 00:14:40,285; ;(Speaker One) So do you think it was more something like you thought this about yourself and you're worried other people are gonna think about you or did you experience other people treating you differently maybe 'cause they knew you had a criminal record?
152; ;00:14:41,771 --> 00:14:49,652; ;(Speaker Two) I think definitely it was more my own feelings and projecting those feelings onto other people.
153; ;00:14:49,652 --> 00:14:59,160; ;'Cause even everyone that does know what I did, they're like, "Dude, you got arrested for phone calls, bro," I'm like, "Yeah, things happen."
154; ;00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:07,729; ;(Speaker One) So did it make you kind of maybe like self conscious or feel like bit nervous interacting in society or...
155; ;00:15:07,729 --> 00:15:12,787; ;(Speaker Two) Definitely more self conscious and nervous and kind of like you're...
156; ;00:15:12,787 --> 00:15:20,700; ;At least for me, always walking on egg shells like make sure you say the right things, act the right way, you don't wanna end up in the slammer again.
157; ;00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:26,177; ;(Speaker One) So it kind of... You would say it affects how you do things maybe?
158; ;00:15:28,471 --> 00:15:29,653; ;(Speaker Two) Definitely, yeah.
159; ;00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:38,801; ;(Speaker One) Is there anything that made this process easier for you?
160; ;00:15:39,592 --> 00:15:40,969; ;(Speaker Two) The process of?
161; ;00:15:40,969 --> 00:15:42,400; ;(Speaker One) Just like reintegrating.
162; ;00:15:48,231 --> 00:15:51,871; ;(Speaker Two) Initially, there wasn't, It just took time I guess.
163; ;00:15:54,082 --> 00:15:58,241; ;I guess it was time to forgive myself, I guess you would say.
164; ;00:16:00,294 --> 00:16:03,078; ;But I mean that's about it.
165; ;00:16:03,078 --> 00:16:09,029; ;(Speaker One) Was there anything that made the process harder like unnecessarily difficult for you or anything like that?
166; ;00:16:10,805 --> 00:16:19,490; ;(Speaker Two) I guess it was just like the going to court repetitively after everything and then like doing the probation and things.
167; ;00:16:19,490 --> 00:16:30,524; ;It reopens those wounds until that was completely done and the county said that I was, I guess, free again.
168; ;00:16:30,524 --> 00:16:34,348; ;I could really start the process to get over myself.
169; ;00:16:34,348 --> 00:16:39,078; ;(Speaker One) So are you driving with Uber while you were still like having to go to court and do the probation?
170; ;00:16:39,078 --> 00:16:41,041; ;(Speaker Two) Oh, no, no. It was many years ago.
171; ;00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:42,106; ;(Speaker One) Okay.
172; ;00:16:50,026 --> 00:16:58,489; ;So have you ever felt like you were treated poorly or different by people because you had a criminal record?
173; ;00:17:04,264 --> 00:17:09,189; ;(Speaker Two) No, I think that people that treated me poorly or differently weren't gonna do that regardless.
174; ;00:17:11,111 --> 00:17:12,971; ;At least for me personally, yeah.
175; ;00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:19,176; ;(Speaker One) Do you think you've ever experienced prejudice or discrimination because you have a criminal record?
176; ;00:17:21,897 --> 00:17:24,214; ;(Speaker Two) For me, personally no because of the criminal record.
177; ;00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:32,233; ;(Speaker One) Do you think driving, well, you said it was many years ago.
178; ;00:17:32,233 --> 00:17:35,496; ;So this question might not apply, just let me know if it doesn't.
179; ;00:17:37,053 --> 00:17:42,961; ;Do you think driving for Uber played any role to help with the reintegration process?
180; ;00:17:42,961 --> 00:17:49,950; ;(Speaker Two) Oh, definitely like I was saying, I was kind of a homebody and that was partially due to all that stuff.
181; ;00:17:49,950 --> 00:18:00,005; ;I'm kind of, lost faith in society I guess or in humanity or whatever and just meeting all the people and seeing kindness, I guess.
182; ;00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:05,410; ;Kind of helped with the reintegration.
183; ;00:18:06,458 --> 00:18:09,429; ;(Speaker One) So like the social aspects kind of a driving you would say?
184; ;00:18:09,429 --> 00:18:11,786; ;(Speaker Two) Definitely, yeah. (Speaker One) Yeah.
185; ;00:18:13,696 --> 00:18:14,735; ;Let's see.
186; ;00:18:18,824 --> 00:18:29,342; ;So you kind of mentioned this before like you said you've had like in your 1,000-something trips, you've had some riders that offend, not good.
187; ;00:18:29,342 --> 00:18:35,964; ;Can you think of any specific time when you've had a hard time or faced a specific challenge driving with Uber?
188; ;00:18:40,057 --> 00:18:44,678; ;(Speaker Two) Sure, there was a guy that I picked up and he was with his friend.
189; ;00:18:44,678 --> 00:18:59,250; ;And I guess he was mad 'cause his girlfriend went to Vegas with a bunch of dudes and he was asking me my opinion and I was like, "Sir, I don't know you, I don't know your girlfriend, it's not cool to ask me this."
190; ;00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:03,858; ;And he got really angry, surprisingly, I mean, he wanted to fight me.
191; ;00:19:03,858 --> 00:19:05,102; ;And I didn't know what to do.
192; ;00:19:05,102 --> 00:19:07,891; ;So I said, "Dude, do you really want to fight?" And he said, "Yeah."
193; ;00:19:07,891 --> 00:19:09,922; ;So I pulled over and said, "All right, okay, let's fight."
194; ;00:19:09,922 --> 00:19:17,871; ;And then when he was getting down, I just drove off 'cause I didn't see any way around that, he wanted to...
195; ;00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:24,858; ;(Speaker One) So that was kind of like left a bad impression on you like that was a bad experience. (Speaker Two) No, no, no.
196; ;00:19:24,858 --> 00:19:31,638; ;Not a bad impression for as far as Uber anyways, just more towards like seeing new people who are ridiculous.
197; ;00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:38,475; ;Yeah, like I said those people are in the minority of, the vast minority of rides.
198; ;00:19:39,650 --> 00:19:50,375; ;(Speaker One) Can you think of anything that's been challenging driving with Uber like when you first started, was there anything about the sign up process that was difficult or like getting accustomed to the app or how payment worked?
199; ;00:19:53,385 --> 00:20:00,581; ;(Speaker Two) I think the hardest thing was using the native navigation what they have.
200; ;00:20:00,581 --> 00:20:11,441; ;It wasn't until maybe 20 rides in which is, we're talking about Google maps, I mean how you can tie them in together which was pretty comfortable.
201; ;00:20:11,441 --> 00:20:13,189; ;(Speaker One) So you wish you knew that like right off the bat.
202; ;00:20:13,189 --> 00:20:15,278; ;(Speaker Two) Yeah, definitely. (Speaker One) Yeah.
203; ;00:20:15,278 --> 00:20:17,356; ;Can you think of anything else that's been challenging?
204; ;00:20:20,531 --> 00:20:21,933; ;(Speaker Two) Well, it's always been pretty straight forward.
205; ;00:20:21,933 --> 00:20:34,607; ;Oh, I guess the challenging thing was the first time I filed taxes with driving with Uber but I got that all figured it and it's actually a lot easier than people make it seem.
206; ;00:20:35,763 --> 00:20:41,314; ;(Speaker One) Do you think Uber could like provide any guidance on filing taxes that would be helpful?
207; ;00:20:46,333 --> 00:20:50,844; ;(Speaker Two) No, I mean, they don't put them in a weird place liability-wise I guess.
208; ;00:20:51,988 --> 00:20:56,838; ;I just talked to a tax payer and he explained it and I was like it's that easy.
209; ;00:20:56,838 --> 00:20:59,429; ;I think that's more of the responsibility of the driver.
210; ;00:20:59,429 --> 00:21:00,456; ;(Speaker One) Okay.
211; ;00:21:05,486 --> 00:21:21,342; ;(Speaker Two) I do though think like, I think Uber should have a mentor program or maybe the first 10 rides, they will have like a veteran driver in the car with the person just to get a hang of things, you know, like show him the ropes, I guess, so to speak.
212; ;00:21:21,342 --> 00:21:22,498; ;That would be pretty awesome.
213; ;00:21:22,498 --> 00:21:25,676; ;I know a lot of drivers that would appreciate that.
214; ;00:21:25,676 --> 00:21:31,372; ;(Speaker One) So why do you think it would be helpful, just having someone there to like answer question or just to make you feel more at ease?
215; ;00:21:31,372 --> 00:21:32,380; ;(Speaker Two) Well, a few things.
216; ;00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:41,795; ;I think strangers getting into your car can be intimidating and like a lot of Uber drivers really multitask.
217; ;00:21:41,795 --> 00:21:55,407; ;Like you are watching the nav, you are watching your speed limit, you are making sure that your rider's comfortable and just someone there for that reassurance I think would be very helpful and help people integrate to the driver lifestyle a lot quicker.
218; ;00:21:55,407 --> 00:21:57,356; ;(Speaker One) Yeah, that's a really good feedback.
219; ;00:21:57,356 --> 00:21:58,375; ;(Speaker Two) Oh, thank you.
220; ;00:21:59,387 --> 00:22:03,114; ;(Speaker One) So you said driver lifestyle, can you talk more about what you mean by that?
221; ;00:22:05,042 --> 00:22:14,128; ;(Speaker Two) I think it's definitely like really fast-paced, and it can be stressful if you don't know how to cope with it.
222; ;00:22:14,128 --> 00:22:20,475; ;And there's definitely like those long nights where you'd rather be doing something else but, you know, you got to make some cash.
223; ;00:22:23,171 --> 00:22:33,676; ;And I guess it's a lot of coping with new situations 'cause I think that would be hard for people dealing with frustrations.
224; ;00:22:33,676 --> 00:22:40,050; ;But I think that's more life skills than Uber lifestyle, right? Yeah.
225; ;00:22:40,050 --> 00:22:45,850; ;(Speaker One) Can you give me examples of anything like coping with stressful situations like an example?
226; ;00:22:49,314 --> 00:22:55,692; ;(Speaker Two) Like when you have a rider that's on a time crunch but then you hit traffic and then they're complaining at you, not understanding.
227; ;00:22:58,231 --> 00:23:05,755; ;Like definitely 20-year-old me would have gotten angry but I'm just like "Oh, I can't help it, I'm sorry, I'll get you there as fast as I can." you know.
228; ;00:23:05,755 --> 00:23:09,974; ;(Speaker One) Are people usually pretty receptive to that like they understand?
229; ;00:23:09,974 --> 00:23:16,068; ;(Speaker Two) Most people, yeah, most people understand, some people get pretty lively.
230; ;00:23:17,754 --> 00:23:23,038; ;But it's not a big deal, it's never came, for me at least, it's never came into an argument or an altercation.
231; ;00:23:23,038 --> 00:23:25,971; ;(Speaker One) Yeah. (Speaker Two) And that I couldn't.
232; ;00:23:25,971 --> 00:23:29,711; ;I just make my way out off rather than coming to life with stick-ups or something.
233; ;00:23:29,711 --> 00:23:31,010; ;(Speaker One) Right.
234; ;00:23:31,010 --> 00:23:39,909; ;Do you think Uber could do anything to support drivers like may be preparing them for those kind of situations or anything like that?
235; ;00:23:39,909 --> 00:23:44,844; ;(Speaker Two) I think, yeah, they can do things to prepare them but I think it's more on the rider side.
236; ;00:23:44,844 --> 00:23:48,990; ;I think riders don't understand that us drivers are also human.
237; ;00:23:48,990 --> 00:24:04,287; ;We're gonna make mistakes, we're gonna miss turns, and then also a lot of riders, I've noticed that at least for the demographic I usually don't drive, so they get uncomfortable like when you check your blind spot and have people go like, "Why do you keep looking at me?"
238; ;00:24:04,287 --> 00:24:07,506; ;"Dude, I'm not looking at you, I swear, I'm trying to not crash."
239; ;00:24:08,957 --> 00:24:17,775; ;So I just think that I don't know, maybe Uber as a company can send out an email saying something like our drivers are human too.
240; ;00:24:19,358 --> 00:24:24,155; ;Please, also understand the rules of the road so you don't mislabel.
241; ;00:24:24,155 --> 00:24:31,895; ;Like I know I'm a very safe driver and people have said that I'm not a safe driver and that's really irritating but it is what it is, you know.
242; ;00:24:31,895 --> 00:24:34,125; ;(Speaker One) Yeah, makes sense.
243; ;00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:49,603; ;So do you think that you face any different challenges being someone who has a criminal record and driving with Uber compared to someone who doesn't have a criminal record who drives with Uber?
244; ;00:24:51,036 --> 00:24:54,360; ;(Speaker Two) No, not at all, I think all the challenges are the same all around.
245; ;00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:55,366; ;I mean...
246; ;00:25:01,867 --> 00:25:07,173; ;At least for me, personally, I don't think I faced any different challenges but other...
247; ;00:25:07,173 --> 00:25:18,875; ;(Speaker One) Can you think of maybe something, maybe not necessarily for you personally but other people who have a criminal record, can you think of any challenges that they would face that might be different from people driving that don't have a criminal record?
248; ;00:25:23,443 --> 00:25:38,540; ;(Speaker Two) Just being on the road more is increases the likelihood of maybe being pulled over or which can definitely put someone who has a previous criminal record at a high tension I guess you would say.
249; ;00:25:40,387 --> 00:25:42,689; ;And things also like.
250; ;00:25:45,630 --> 00:25:52,828; ;Some riders will have conversations about certain people with criminal records and I know that could probably make...
251; ;00:25:54,071 --> 00:26:13,555; ;It doesn't make me uncomfortable personally but someone that has more I guess "serious record" might have trouble coping with that situation and even though they are taking steps to grow as a person become a better person.
252; ;00:26:13,555 --> 00:26:15,711; ;It's really harkening, you know.
253; ;00:26:17,704 --> 00:26:21,520; ;(Speaker One) Do you mean like riders talking amongst themselves or talking to the driver?
254; ;00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:23,553; ;(Speaker Two) Oh, both, both, yeah.
255; ;00:26:23,553 --> 00:26:28,087; ;I guess riders aren't aware that some people have criminal records, some are.
256; ;00:26:30,164 --> 00:26:43,424; ;And people get a bit, I guess opinionated with things and then they wanna tell everyone about it and, you know, I refrain from that cause you don't know what's people's walks of life are, their circumstances.
257; ;00:26:43,424 --> 00:26:52,995; ;(Speaker One) Yeah, so you think it could like if riders are talking about their opinions about someone that could make a driver uncomfortable or self conscious or feel awkward, like that?
258; ;00:26:52,995 --> 00:26:55,782; ;(Speaker Two) And even drivers without criminal records also.
259; ;00:26:55,782 --> 00:26:56,910; ;(Speaker One) Yeah.
260; ;00:26:56,910 --> 00:27:01,769; ;(Speaker Two) You'd be surprised at what sort of things people talk about in the back of my car like I'm not there.
261; ;00:27:05,765 --> 00:27:07,649; ;(Speaker One) All right.
262; ;00:27:07,649 --> 00:27:15,685; ;So you kind of also talked about this before but can tell you me anything else about what it's like interacting with riders?
263; ;00:27:17,785 --> 00:27:23,007; ;(Speaker Two) Definitely for the first few minutes, it's tense, for me anyways.
264; ;00:27:23,007 --> 00:27:36,931; ;The hardest part is gauging what the rider is looking for in terms of, do they wanna just sit back and not talk and look out of the window or do they want to conversate.
265; ;00:27:36,931 --> 00:27:41,280; ;And I just have a few, personally, like...
266; ;00:27:43,297 --> 00:27:47,655; ;I guess feeler questions to see how they are.
267; ;00:27:50,013 --> 00:27:59,177; ;But for the most part, interacting with the riders is I'd say probably the hardest part and the easiest part if that makes sense I don't know how to explain it.
268; ;00:27:59,177 --> 00:28:01,662; ;(Speaker One) Yeah, probably depends on the person too.
269; ;00:28:01,662 --> 00:28:02,694; ;(Speaker Two) Definitely.
270; ;00:28:02,694 --> 00:28:12,036; ;(Speaker One) What do you say, so you said at first you were kind of like a homebody, you stayed at home a lot and then you started driving for Uber and that kind of made you a little bit more social.
271; ;00:28:13,326 --> 00:28:20,535; ;What do you say when you first started driving, that was a hard transition to socially interact with riders because you spent so much time being a homebody?
272; ;00:28:28,701 --> 00:28:29,727; ;(Speaker Two) Sorry... (Speaker One) No.
273; ;00:28:29,727 --> 00:28:31,352; ;Take your time, you think.
274; ;00:28:34,431 --> 00:28:43,953; ;(Speaker Two) I think the hardest part was interacting with them was just the fact that they were strangers. (Speaker One) Right.
275; ;00:28:43,953 --> 00:28:45,927; ;(Speaker Two) Not necessarily interacting with people.
276; ;00:28:47,303 --> 00:28:52,978; ;So I guess even like being a homebody, I still had that social life form line I guess like the gaming and things.
277; ;00:28:52,978 --> 00:28:53,998; ;(Speaker One) Yup.
278; ;00:28:56,410 --> 00:28:57,745; ;(Speaker Two) So does that answers your question at all?
279; ;00:28:57,745 --> 00:28:59,805; ;(Speaker One) Yeah. There's no right answers.
280; ;00:28:59,805 --> 00:29:01,460; ;I just want to hear what you have to say.
281; ;00:29:05,011 --> 00:29:11,277; ;So anything you dislike about conversing with riders or interacting with riders?
282; ;00:29:18,322 --> 00:29:22,781; ;(Speaker Two) No, there's only been a couple situations where it was uncomfortable.
283; ;00:29:25,325 --> 00:29:26,976; ;(Speaker One) Can you give me an example?
284; ;00:29:26,976 --> 00:29:35,482; ;(Speaker Two) Sure, I was working in Berkeley and I was near one of the protests and I picked up a bunch of people.
285; ;00:29:37,132 --> 00:29:38,874; ;And to me, like, everyone's the same.
286; ;00:29:38,874 --> 00:29:53,407; ;I don't try to categorize people or anything, you know, but the people started conversating with me about antifa and black-clad sort of things, and I guess boasting about the fact that they are punching people.
287; ;00:29:53,407 --> 00:30:07,360; ;And I wanted to just pullover and say get out of my car like that's not cool but I sucked it up and just drove until the destination and when they got out eventually, but situations like that are kind of hard to deal with.
288; ;00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:09,047; ;(Speaker One) Like you kind of feel trapped. (Speaker Two) Yeah.
289; ;00:30:09,047 --> 00:30:11,058; ;(Speaker One) You are uncomfortable with it but you also don't know what to do.
290; ;00:30:11,058 --> 00:30:20,201; ;(Speaker Two) Yeah, And that too, and I think drivers are in a place between the rating and being honest with themselves, right?
291; ;00:30:20,201 --> 00:30:27,029; ;So if they were like friends of friends and I was driving, then I would have kicked them out of the car.
292; ;00:30:27,029 --> 00:30:32,356; ;"I wouldn't care what your political roots are, I don't go around punching people, you know, get off my car."
293; ;00:30:32,356 --> 00:30:37,306; ;And then I'm like as a driver I'm like, well, I'm now like gonna get a 1 star and that's gonna screw me up, right?
294; ;00:30:37,306 --> 00:30:38,321; ;(Speaker One) Yeah.
295; ;00:30:41,113 --> 00:30:42,556; ;(Speaker Two) Yeah, I think, does...
296; ;00:30:42,556 --> 00:30:43,576; ;(Speaker One) Yeah, yeah, yeah. (Speaker Two) Okay.
297; ;00:30:46,601 --> 00:30:52,589; ;(Speaker One) All right, so when you are not driving for Uber, what kind of things do you like to do for fun?
298; ;00:30:55,264 --> 00:31:06,811; ;(Speaker Two) For fun, I love going camping and then hiking when I can and then like fishing is kind of my polar opposite of driving kind of just sit there and enjoy the scenery, right?
299; ;00:31:06,811 --> 00:31:07,823; ;(Speaker One) Yeah.
300; ;00:31:08,889 --> 00:31:11,743; ;(Speaker Two) So that's definitely...
301; ;00:31:11,743 --> 00:31:22,517; ;And then do other things like sometimes I go paintballing or a little more extreme things but mostly right now, I'm involved in homework and working.
303; ;00:31:23,541 --> 00:31:29,964; ;(Speaker Two) I don't really have a good balance between personal life and work and school.
304; ;00:31:29,964 --> 00:31:32,451; ;(Speaker One) So you said that you paintball. (Speaker Two) Yeah.
305; ;00:31:32,451 --> 00:31:36,899; ;(Speaker One) What are like the other like extreme sports as you call them?
306; ;00:31:36,899 --> 00:31:47,329; ;(Speaker Two) I love motor sports, so I'll try to go do some track time or things like that or go to like one of those like super fast go-kart places, It will be fun.
307; ;00:31:47,329 --> 00:31:50,027; ;(Speaker One) What do you like about those kinds of activities?
308; ;00:31:54,254 --> 00:31:55,367; ;(Speaker Two) I love going fast.
309; ;00:31:55,367 --> 00:32:01,056; ;It's just kind of this natural feeling of euphoria I guess for me personally.
310; ;00:32:02,886 --> 00:32:09,165; ;Which was a challenge for me driving with Uber because I always wanted to be heavy with my accelerator.
302; ;00:31:22,517 --> 00:31:23,541; ;(Speaker One) Yeah.
311; ;00:32:09,165 --> 00:32:10,170; ;(Speaker One) Right.
312; ;00:32:10,170 --> 00:32:16,054; ;(Speaker Two) But I realized it's not professional and I don't want to put people lives in danger anyway so.
313; ;00:32:16,054 --> 00:32:18,238; ;(Speaker One) So kind of like separating like hobby from driving.
314; ;00:32:18,238 --> 00:32:20,394; ;(Speaker Two) Right, exactly.
315; ;00:32:20,394 --> 00:32:21,781; ;(Speaker One) Yeah. Cool.
316; ;00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:31,136; ;Is there anything else you want to tell me, any other feedback or thoughts, things you thought of from earlier questions or really anything else?
317; ;00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:49,441; ;(Speaker Two) I think I wrote in one time on a survey but I wish there would be at least a team of drivers that is connected with the engineering department that are real time debuggers, not debuggers, but bug finders I guess.
318; ;00:32:50,787 --> 00:33:00,000; ;'Cause there are some problems with the app that happens, and then you call Support and try to tell them like, "Hey, can you forward this to engineering?"
319; ;00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,170; ;And they're like, "Sure."
320; ;00:33:01,170 --> 00:33:07,228; ;But then like nothing changes in your end and you wonder like, "Did they really forward it to engineering or did they just dismiss me," right?
323; ;00:33:27,226 --> 00:33:32,085; ;(Speaker One) So like a more of like social setting for drivers to interact in?
324; ;00:33:32,085 --> 00:33:33,109; ;(Speaker Two) Definitely.
325; ;00:33:33,109 --> 00:33:51,809; ;I mean, there is like I guess there is kind of like camaraderie like you could see it in another Uber driver trying to merge you kind of slow down and then you are kind of like, like if they are trying to come off of the curve, you will hold traffic off for them or something, you know.
326; ;00:33:51,809 --> 00:33:53,528; ;(Speaker One) That's cool. I have never heard that before.
322; ;00:33:24,968 --> 00:33:27,226; ;Relationships cultivated amongst drivers.
321; ;00:33:10,496 --> 00:33:22,242; ;And I wish there would be like some kind of formal, not formal, just something nice but, you know, formal Uber events where drivers can meet each other and I think that is important.
327; ;00:33:53,528 --> 00:33:56,733; ;(Speaker Two) Yeah, but I wish I was more cultivated.
328; ;00:34:00,258 --> 00:34:13,338; ;I think it's important for people especially in the upper echelons of management, I think like I read in the news that Kalanick, the CEO drove as the driver for a week.
329; ;00:34:15,736 --> 00:34:26,825; ;I think it's important that everyone understands what it's like to be a driver 'cause unless you have that experience, it's something to you like, "Oh, you're just driving people around."
330; ;00:34:26,825 --> 00:34:29,296; ;But it's way more depth than that.
331; ;00:34:29,296 --> 00:34:39,963; ;It's a balancing act between, you know, abiding like safety and then you have the social aspect and then...
332; ;00:34:42,050 --> 00:34:43,637; ;(Speaker One) There's just like a lot more to it than people might think.
333; ;00:34:43,637 --> 00:34:45,948; ;(Speaker Two) Exactly, it's not just people getting in your car and driving.
334; ;00:34:45,948 --> 00:34:47,552; ;(Speaker One) Yeah. (Speaker Two) It's a lot more than that.
335; ;00:34:47,552 --> 00:34:50,907; ;(Speaker One) Especially in the busy areas like the bay.
336; ;00:34:50,907 --> 00:35:03,636; ;(Speaker Two) We drive some people around the city and see how stressful it feels, you know, and then you're worried about them getting there on time but then you have you to, "Should I take this yellow light or not."
337; ;00:35:03,636 --> 00:35:06,416; ;(Speaker Two) You know... (Speaker One) Right.
338; ;00:35:06,416 --> 00:35:12,264; ;(Speaker Two) But I mean I think for the most part, Uber helps a lot of people and I really appreciate that.
339; ;00:35:12,264 --> 00:35:19,179; ;(Speaker One) Okay, and I see how you are talking about the Uber driver camaraderie like letting each other in, do you like that?
340; ;00:35:19,179 --> 00:35:22,469; ;Do you feel like you are like part of a group?
341; ;00:35:22,469 --> 00:35:27,811; ;(Speaker Two) It's not so much part of a group, it's I think people are recognizing each other struggle.
342; ;00:35:27,811 --> 00:35:34,755; ;And it doesn't even stop at just Uber drivers to Uber drivers, It's T&C drivers in general.
343; ;00:35:34,755 --> 00:35:46,787; ;They understand each other's struggle and frustrations so they are more willing to help each other and I think the world can use a little more of that, you know.
344; ;00:35:46,787 --> 00:35:48,049; ;(Speaker One) Yeah.
345; ;00:35:48,049 --> 00:35:54,975; ;So do you enjoy that aspect of it like identifying with other people who are doing the same thing as you?
346; ;00:35:57,276 --> 00:36:12,068; ;(Speaker Two) It's not, I guess, it's not so much as doing the same thing as me but appreciating another person's situation is what I enjoy the most, yeah.
347; ;00:36:12,068 --> 00:36:14,579; ;(Speaker One) Cool, all right, anything else?
348; ;00:36:19,194 --> 00:36:20,196; ;(Speaker Two) I don't think so.
349; ;00:36:21,664 --> 00:36:23,421; ;Is there anything else that...
350; ;00:36:23,421 --> 00:36:25,178; ;(Speaker One) No, I got through everything.
351; ;00:36:26,592 --> 00:36:28,932; ;Yeah, let me stop...
1; ;00:00:00,644 --> 00:00:09,621; ;(Speaker One) Okay, so as I mentioned, we just wanna hear about your experiences, nothing you say will affect your status with the Uber or your driver account.
2; ;00:00:09,621 --> 00:00:15,654; ;I have no connection to your driver account, so I really just want you to be open and honest, there's no right answer.
3; ;00:00:15,654 --> 00:00:20,067; ;I really just wanna know your honest feedback, so feel free to say anything good or bad.
4; ;00:00:20,067 --> 00:00:22,399; ;You could say you hate Uber, whatever you want, okay?
5; ;00:00:24,027 --> 00:00:30,845; ;And as I mentioned, we're audio recording and there will be no personal identifiable information connected to this.
6; ;00:00:30,845 --> 00:00:35,919; ;So first, I just kind of wanna start out like general questions about driving with Uber.
7; ;00:00:35,919 --> 00:00:40,079; ;So how did you start driving with Uber?
8; ;00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:42,951; ;How did you decide? Why did you choose to drive for Uber?
9; ;00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:56,845; ;(Speaker Two) My sister was an Uber driver and she asked me if I could use her sign-up link so she could get the referral bonus.
10; ;00:00:56,845 --> 00:00:59,049; ;And during the course of the time for driving, I would...
11; ;00:00:59,049 --> 00:01:08,076; ;My original plan was to do the 100 rides and stop, but a lot of people would get in the car and say things like, "If it wasn't for Uber I would be driving home drunk now."
12; ;00:01:09,288 --> 00:01:10,993; ;And a lot of people say things.
13; ;00:01:13,306 --> 00:01:24,494; ;It was evident that they would be driving to detriment themselves I guess and that really made me to believe in the platform so I decided to stick with it.
14; ;00:01:24,494 --> 00:01:27,137; ;(Speaker One) And how long have you been driving with Uber?
15; ;00:01:27,137 --> 00:01:31,669; ;(Speaker Two) I think I've been driving with Uber now for 14 or 15 months.
16; ;00:01:31,669 --> 00:01:32,901; ;(Speaker One) Wow. Okay.
17; ;00:01:32,901 --> 00:01:35,501; ;(Speaker Two) Well, probably 1300 rides in.
18; ;00:01:35,501 --> 00:01:36,548; ;(Speaker One) Cool.
19; ;00:01:37,813 --> 00:01:45,501; ;Can you tell me maybe one or two things that you really like about driving with Uber and then one or two things that you really dislike about driving with Uber?
20; ;00:01:45,501 --> 00:01:46,861; ;You can start with either one.
21; ;00:01:51,893 --> 00:01:59,606; ;(Speaker Two) It's not so much dislike in driving with Uber, just the way certain things are set up like for example, the promotions... (Speaker One) Yup.
22; ;00:02:00,613 --> 00:02:08,002; ;(Speaker Two) Like I could do a whole bunch of rides that are short and get the promotion and choose to decline rides that are far. (Speaker One) Right.
23; ;00:02:09,035 --> 00:02:14,800; ;(Speaker Two) I think it would be awesome if they implemented some kind of distance as well with the promotions.
24; ;00:02:18,067 --> 00:02:33,806; ;Another thing, it's not so much driving with Uber, again, I really enjoy it, I like to drive so it works well, but sometimes you get to run around with support like they will give you the same answer and same answer, and you will call back and they will give you the same answer.
25; ;00:02:33,806 --> 00:02:38,206; ;And to me, it's obvious they are reading from a script. (Speaker One) Right.
26; ;00:02:38,206 --> 00:02:45,002; ;(Speaker Two) I just wish that support would be more receptive to your problem rather than trying to find what to say on the paper.
27; ;00:02:45,002 --> 00:03:01,342; ;You know, but what I love driving with Uber is, I can set my own hours, I can make as much or as little as I need to make, and I love that you can cash out whenever you need.
28; ;00:03:01,342 --> 00:03:06,876; ;We don't have... I'm a student as well so it helps with the tuition and books.
29; ;00:03:06,876 --> 00:03:10,194; ;And if I needed a book this week, I don't have to wait for a paycheck, you know?
30; ;00:03:10,194 --> 00:03:12,166; ;(Speaker One) Right, that makes sense.
31; ;00:03:12,166 --> 00:03:28,226; ;(Speaker Two) And what I really, really love is it seems now especially with the 180 days of change, they're doing a lots to, I guess, cultivate a relationship with the drivers rather than their drivers being...
32; ;00:03:28,226 --> 00:03:38,511; ;Before it felt like the drivers were a part of the company but a separate entity and we were kinda left in the wind, but now it seems to be changing and I really appreciate that.
33; ;00:03:38,511 --> 00:03:39,529; ;(Speaker One) Cool.
34; ;00:03:39,529 --> 00:03:48,005; ;Okay, can you tell me kind of about like do you have a typical driving schedule that you stick to or do you mix it up every week?
35; ;00:03:49,634 --> 00:04:01,333; ;(Speaker Two) Normally on the weekends, I'll probably drive more consistently like I like to drive in Berkley, it's a good spot, but really it's kind of about the way or whatever my class schedules are.
36; ;00:04:01,333 --> 00:04:02,360; ;(Speaker One) Okay.
37; ;00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:08,789; ;And would you say how many days in a week would you drive and how many hours a day typically?
38; ;00:04:10,272 --> 00:04:21,652; ;(Speaker Two) Now when you say hours driving, is it like, logged in? 'cause like I noticed with the trend with me, it's like if I have a far trip, I'll log off till I get to my area of operation.
39; ;00:04:21,652 --> 00:04:22,819; ;(Speaker One) Got you.
40; ;00:04:22,819 --> 00:04:27,197; ;Yeah, just some general... How long do you spend driving?
41; ;00:04:27,197 --> 00:04:34,655; ;(Speaker Two) I think maybe I'll probably spend altogether maybe, 35 to 40 hours a week with Uber.
42; ;00:04:34,655 --> 00:04:35,667; ;(Speaker One) Yup. (Speaker Two) Yeah.
43; ;00:04:35,667 --> 00:04:38,964; ;(Speaker One) And do you drive every day? Do you take some days off?
44; ;00:04:41,259 --> 00:04:44,140; ;(Speaker Two) I definitely don't drive every day, so maybe I'll take like a week off.
45; ;00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:45,739; ;(Speaker One) Yup, cool.
46; ;00:04:48,227 --> 00:05:00,169; ;So you kind of mentioned this about how you can drive around your class schedule, so do you find that flexibility of deciding when you drive a good thing or do you find it challenging?
47; ;00:05:03,033 --> 00:05:04,054; ;(Speaker Two) A little of both.
48; ;00:05:04,054 --> 00:05:14,112; ;You can totally choose to slack off and not work but I think that's one of the biggest draws of why drivers stay with Uber.
49; ;00:05:14,112 --> 00:05:21,956; ;(Speaker One) Can you tell me more about kind of like it's challenging because you can, you know, no one says you have to be here at a certain time and how you can kind of slack off.
50; ;00:05:21,956 --> 00:05:26,685; ;Can you tell me anything more about that like what's your thought process really like when you are like, "I don't know if I really wanna drive today."
51; ;00:05:26,685 --> 00:05:45,342; ;(Speaker Two) It's kind of like a, super procrastination and telling, you're like I'll just make it up tomorrow, you know, which is really detrimental to like my personal clients, you know, so sometimes, I have to really kick myself to get in the car. Speaker one) Yeah.
52; ;00:05:45,342 --> 00:05:48,086; ;(speaker Two) And it's not like I'll do this on the days that I drive.
53; ;00:05:48,086 --> 00:05:53,184; ;I don't drive for Uber but also go driving and it's like, "Dude, I could be making some cash right now."
54; ;00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:55,912; ;Yeah.
55; ;00:05:55,912 --> 00:05:56,922; ;(Speaker One) Okay.
56; ;00:05:56,922 --> 00:05:58,331; ;(Speaker Two) Does that answer your question? (Speaker One) Yeah.
57; ;00:06:00,299 --> 00:06:05,177; ;So how much longer do you anticipate you'll be driving with Uber?
58; ;00:06:07,914 --> 00:06:13,303; ;(Speaker Two) At least probably two and a half years more when I finish my undergraduate degree.
59; ;00:06:13,303 --> 00:06:15,345; ;(Speaker One) And what is your major?
60; ;00:06:15,345 --> 00:06:17,804; ;(Speaker Two) I'm majoring in computer sciences in engineering.
61; ;00:06:17,804 --> 00:06:19,327; ;(Speaker One) Awesome.
62; ;00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:25,800; ;Okay, so anything that would make you more or less likely to continue driving with Uber?
63; ;00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:42,171; ;(Speaker Two) Definitely, there's things that would make it more likely to drive with Uber but unless there's some cash traffic thing in the news, I don't think I would stop.
64; ;00:06:42,707 --> 00:06:45,551; ;(Speaker One) What would make you more likely to continue driving with Uber?
65; ;00:06:47,519 --> 00:06:49,437; ;(Speaker Two) If they just implement different things.
66; ;00:06:49,437 --> 00:06:58,249; ;If Uber just implemented different things for drivers and I think the biggest thing is holding riders more accountable.
67; ;00:06:58,249 --> 00:07:10,304; ;Like I've gotten trips where riders had like three star rating and I'm wondering how they're still on the platform 'cause I thought bad ratings would get riders banned as well, at least that was my understanding.
68; ;00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:20,281; ;(Speaker One) So there's sometimes like dealing with challenging riders, something that makes you not like driving with Uber that much.
69; ;00:07:20,281 --> 00:07:25,383; ;(Speaker Two) Oh, it has nothing to do with Uber, just people in general like I said.
70; ;00:07:25,383 --> 00:07:33,668; ;But in my experience at least driving with Uber like I have done almost 1500 rides, I probably only have four or five bad ones.
71; ;00:07:33,668 --> 00:07:36,387; ;Just seems like the bad ones stand out more than some... (Speaker One) Yeah.
72; ;00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:39,337; ;Okay, that makes sense.
73; ;00:07:41,261 --> 00:07:49,427; ;So you kind of mentioned this like, that you can get cash to pay for tuition or books, so would you say driving for Uber like helps you make ends meet?
74; ;00:07:49,427 --> 00:07:50,642; ;Is this your source of income?
75; ;00:07:50,642 --> 00:07:52,391; ;(Speaker Two) Definitely, yeah.
76; ;00:07:52,391 --> 00:08:05,271; ;I mean, ends meet, even if I'm super on budget from my normal gigs and things, it gives me my take on life 'cause I think that's important.
77; ;00:08:05,271 --> 00:08:08,659; ;(Speaker One) So do you do other things to make money other than driving with Uber?
78; ;00:08:08,659 --> 00:08:09,950; ;(Speaker Two) Yeah, I do.
79; ;00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:13,741; ;A telecom job, so I do like a network infrastructure and things.
80; ;00:08:13,741 --> 00:08:14,760; ;(Speaker One) Cool.
81; ;00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:21,457; ;And what do you say like you do that 50% of the time and drive with Uber 50% of the time or how?
82; ;00:08:21,457 --> 00:08:27,744; ;(Speaker Two) Oh no, it's probably it's like Uber is 95% of the time and then the other job is kind of when it comes.
83; ;00:08:27,744 --> 00:08:29,229; ;(Speaker One) Got you. That makes sense.
84; ;00:08:30,286 --> 00:08:35,200; ;So what do you think you would be doing if you weren't driving with Uber?
85; ;00:08:37,417 --> 00:08:42,463; ;(Speaker Two) That's hard, I don't know, It's a...
86; ;00:08:47,037 --> 00:08:53,389; ;Probably more units in school but I don't think I would be doing anything for work specifically.
87; ;00:08:54,541 --> 00:09:03,849; ;Maybe I would try harder at my telecom job 'cause in that job, I kind of get like large lump sums when I finish but...
88; ;00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:09,819; ;Yeah, I'm kind of like trying to focus on school mostly.
89; ;00:09:09,819 --> 00:09:14,299; ;So I don't think I would be doing as far as employment probably.
90; ;00:09:14,299 --> 00:09:16,612; ;(Speaker One) So you'll just be more like a full time student.
91; ;00:09:16,612 --> 00:09:18,006; ;(Speaker Two) Yeah, definitely.
92; ;00:09:18,006 --> 00:09:20,844; ;Definitely relying more on student loans.
93; ;00:09:20,844 --> 00:09:22,122; ;(Speaker One) Right.
94; ;00:09:22,122 --> 00:09:27,131; ;So do you feel like driving with Uber makes it so you don't have to rely so much on student loans?
95; ;00:09:27,131 --> 00:09:28,405; ;(Speaker Two) Oh, definitely, yeah.
96; ;00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:34,823; ;My first year and half going back to school, I've been loan free because of Uber.
97; ;00:09:34,823 --> 00:09:36,069; ;So I really appreciate it.
98; ;00:09:36,069 --> 00:09:37,091; ;(Speaker One) Cool.
99; ;00:09:38,648 --> 00:09:43,539; ;Okay, so other than making money from driving with Uber...
100; ;00:09:45,647 --> 00:09:50,579; ;Do you think there's any other benefits with driving with Uber that you feel you received?
101; ;00:09:50,579 --> 00:09:52,248; ;(Speaker Two) Sure.
102; ;00:09:52,248 --> 00:09:56,104; ;One thing is I really enjoy meetings lots of people.
103; ;00:09:57,107 --> 00:10:06,425; ;I was kind of at a point where my life was not liking people I guess, so I was always playing video games at home if I'm not doing homework or things.
104; ;00:10:07,902 --> 00:10:10,013; ;So that's really helped me a lot in that regard.
105; ;00:10:11,238 --> 00:10:13,838; ;And then seeing people's kindness is awesome.
106; ;00:10:13,838 --> 00:10:22,492; ;And also I find awesome places to go to that I never knew existed because I'm either picking up or dropping off at these places.
107; ;00:10:22,492 --> 00:10:24,948; ;(Speaker One) Right, it's like places you might never drive on your own.
108; ;00:10:24,948 --> 00:10:26,242; ;(Speaker Two) Right.
109; ;00:10:26,242 --> 00:10:31,771; ;Little like, I don't know, places to eat or things like that, you know.
110; ;00:10:31,771 --> 00:10:33,653; ;(Speaker One) Cool. Okay.
111; ;00:10:33,653 --> 00:10:45,125; ;So one of the reasons we wanted to talk to you specifically is because you got a criminal record when you signed up to drive for the Uber, so we just kind of want to talk to you and learn kind of like what that experience was like?
112; ;00:10:47,172 --> 00:10:54,580; ;So first I want to know how did you know you were able to drive with Uber even with a criminal record?
113; ;00:10:55,665 --> 00:10:58,517; ;(Speaker Two) I didn't, that was kind of just like sign up and see what happens.
114; ;00:10:58,517 --> 00:10:59,852; ;(Speaker One) and it worked? (Speaker Two) Yeah.
115; ;00:11:02,275 --> 00:11:06,301; ;At the same time, I don't, yeah, I guess that was it.
116; ;00:11:06,301 --> 00:11:12,631; ;(Speaker One) So you never like heard that you're able to drive with Uber with a criminal record like before you signed up?
117; ;00:11:12,631 --> 00:11:13,659; ;You didn't know that was like a thing that Uber did?
118; ;00:11:13,659 --> 00:11:15,819; ;(Speaker Two) No, I didn't know that was a thing. (Speaker One) Okay.
119; ;00:11:15,819 --> 00:11:21,112; ;(Speaker Two) And I was just assuming for like what I was charged with it wasn't really a huge thing.
120; ;00:11:21,112 --> 00:11:24,470; ;Like it was annoying phone calls is what I got in trouble for. (Speaker One) Yeah.
121; ;00:11:25,503 --> 00:11:30,898; ;(Speaker Two) So I figured it wasn't like assault or murder or something like that, you know?
122; ;00:11:30,898 --> 00:11:36,318; ;(Speaker One) So when you signed up, you were expecting that you would pass everything and you'd be able to drive?
123; ;00:11:36,318 --> 00:11:37,940; ;(Speaker Two) Well, honestly, I wasn't sure.
124; ;00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:40,357; ;It was like let's see kind of see what happens. (Speaker One) Yeah.
125; ;00:11:40,357 --> 00:11:46,693; ;(Speaker Two) But I was banking on, you know, I didn't do something super horrible so maybe it will go through. (Speaker One) Yeah.
126; ;00:11:46,693 --> 00:11:50,029; ;So how did you feel when it came back and now you are...
127; ;00:11:50,029 --> 00:11:51,043; ;(Speaker Two) I was happy.
128; ;00:11:52,046 --> 00:11:55,774; ;It's definitely a shocker when you get your background checked and it says you are a criminal.
129; ;00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:01,348; ;But yeah, it was a good experience over all.
130; ;00:12:01,348 --> 00:12:02,378; ;(Speaker One) Yeah?
131; ;00:12:03,523 --> 00:12:12,228; ;(Speaker Two) And one surprise though 'cause the background check said like Interpol world tourist watch lists and things and was like, "Whoa, they really go in-depth in checking these people out."
132; ;00:12:16,628 --> 00:12:21,621; ;(Speaker One) So did, you said you were kind of a student and if you weren't driving for Uber, you'd focus on being student.
133; ;00:12:21,621 --> 00:12:26,795; ;But before you signed up to drive with Uber, did you try to get any other sort of employment?
134; ;00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:37,464; ;(Speaker Two) Just like, I have a degree in mechanic work, so I just do odd jobs here and there like mobile oil changes or brake jobs and things, and that really helped.
135; ;00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:47,925; ;But the whole reason I changed my degree is 'cause I hate doing that as a job, it's more of a hobby, so Uber helps a lot.
136; ;00:12:50,484 --> 00:12:59,052; ;(Speaker One) So, can you tell me what it was like for you after you got, what you were charged with?
137; ;00:12:59,052 --> 00:13:00,069; ;(Speaker Two) What do you mean?
138; ;00:13:00,069 --> 00:13:08,243; ;(Speaker One) Like so, after you had your criminal conviction like you went through like how did you feel about it?
139; ;00:13:08,243 --> 00:13:11,978; ;Did it change your life in anyway or so it just kind of like went back to normal?
140; ;00:13:13,449 --> 00:13:15,129; ;(Speaker One) Definitely didn't go back to normal.
141; ;00:13:17,151 --> 00:13:20,834; ;As cushy as it is, I totally felt like I got hosed in the case.
142; ;00:13:21,998 --> 00:13:26,205; ;And it was either spending more time in jail or just plead guilty, so I pled out.
143; ;00:13:29,554 --> 00:13:32,752; ;I guess I was angry at the system for a long time.
144; ;00:13:32,752 --> 00:13:34,453; ;It's like...
145; ;00:13:34,453 --> 00:13:36,581; ;But, you know, I'm over it.
146; ;00:13:36,581 --> 00:13:43,631; ;People mess up, people change, hopefully, change and grow and, yeah.
147; ;00:13:43,631 --> 00:13:57,586; ;(Speaker One) So do you think it like you said it like made you angry, do you think it like affected your life in any way after like was it hard coming back into your normal like social circles or family after that happened?
148; ;00:14:01,341 --> 00:14:13,885; ;(Speaker Two) I guess reintegrating back in with non-criminals was kind of hard because even though may be they don't know what happened, you, at least I held that shame for a long time.
149; ;00:14:13,885 --> 00:14:17,573; ;"I became a criminal now, and what are people gonna think of me."
150; ;00:14:17,573 --> 00:14:30,397; ;I mean it took a long time to get to the mindset where like I know I'm a pretty decent guy and I screwed all those things I guess, yeah.
151; ;00:14:30,397 --> 00:14:40,285; ;(Speaker One) So do you think it was more something like you thought this about yourself and you're worried other people are gonna think about you or did you experience other people treating you differently maybe 'cause they knew you had a criminal record?
152; ;00:14:41,771 --> 00:14:49,652; ;(Speaker Two) I think definitely it was more my own feelings and projecting those feelings onto other people.
153; ;00:14:49,652 --> 00:14:59,160; ;'Cause even everyone that does know what I did, they're like, "Dude, you got arrested for phone calls, bro," I'm like, "Yeah, things happen."
154; ;00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:07,729; ;(Speaker One) So did it make you kind of maybe like self conscious or feel like bit nervous interacting in society or...
155; ;00:15:07,729 --> 00:15:12,787; ;(Speaker Two) Definitely more self conscious and nervous and kind of like you're...
156; ;00:15:12,787 --> 00:15:20,700; ;At least for me, always walking on egg shells like make sure you say the right things, act the right way, you don't wanna end up in the slammer again.
157; ;00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:26,177; ;(Speaker One) So it kind of... You would say it affects how you do things maybe?
158; ;00:15:28,471 --> 00:15:29,653; ;(Speaker Two) Definitely, yeah.
159; ;00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:38,801; ;(Speaker One) Is there anything that made this process easier for you?
160; ;00:15:39,592 --> 00:15:40,969; ;(Speaker Two) The process of?
161; ;00:15:40,969 --> 00:15:42,400; ;(Speaker One) Just like reintegrating.
162; ;00:15:48,231 --> 00:15:51,871; ;(Speaker Two) Initially, there wasn't, It just took time I guess.
163; ;00:15:54,082 --> 00:15:58,241; ;I guess it was time to forgive myself, I guess you would say.
164; ;00:16:00,294 --> 00:16:03,078; ;But I mean that's about it.
165; ;00:16:03,078 --> 00:16:09,029; ;(Speaker One) Was there anything that made the process harder like unnecessarily difficult for you or anything like that?
166; ;00:16:10,805 --> 00:16:19,490; ;(Speaker Two) I guess it was just like the going to court repetitively after everything and then like doing the probation and things.
167; ;00:16:19,490 --> 00:16:30,524; ;It reopens those wounds until that was completely done and the county said that I was, I guess, free again.
168; ;00:16:30,524 --> 00:16:34,348; ;I could really start the process to get over myself.
169; ;00:16:34,348 --> 00:16:39,078; ;(Speaker One) So are you driving with Uber while you were still like having to go to court and do the probation?
170; ;00:16:39,078 --> 00:16:41,041; ;(Speaker Two) Oh, no, no. It was many years ago.
171; ;00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:42,106; ;(Speaker One) Okay.
172; ;00:16:50,026 --> 00:16:58,489; ;So have you ever felt like you were treated poorly or different by people because you had a criminal record?
173; ;00:17:04,264 --> 00:17:09,189; ;(Speaker Two) No, I think that people that treated me poorly or differently weren't gonna do that regardless.
174; ;00:17:11,111 --> 00:17:12,971; ;At least for me personally, yeah.
175; ;00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:19,176; ;(Speaker One) Do you think you've ever experienced prejudice or discrimination because you have a criminal record?
176; ;00:17:21,897 --> 00:17:24,214; ;(Speaker Two) For me, personally no because of the criminal record.
177; ;00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:32,233; ;(Speaker One) Do you think driving, well, you said it was many years ago.
178; ;00:17:32,233 --> 00:17:35,496; ;So this question might not apply, just let me know if it doesn't.
179; ;00:17:37,053 --> 00:17:42,961; ;Do you think driving for Uber played any role to help with the reintegration process?
180; ;00:17:42,961 --> 00:17:49,950; ;(Speaker Two) Oh, definitely like I was saying, I was kind of a homebody and that was partially due to all that stuff.
181; ;00:17:49,950 --> 00:18:00,005; ;I'm kind of, lost faith in society I guess or in humanity or whatever and just meeting all the people and seeing kindness, I guess.
182; ;00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:05,410; ;Kind of helped with the reintegration.
183; ;00:18:06,458 --> 00:18:09,429; ;(Speaker One) So like the social aspects kind of a driving you would say?
184; ;00:18:09,429 --> 00:18:11,786; ;(Speaker Two) Definitely, yeah. (Speaker One) Yeah.
185; ;00:18:13,696 --> 00:18:14,735; ;Let's see.
186; ;00:18:18,824 --> 00:18:29,342; ;So you kind of mentioned this before like you said you've had like in your 1,000-something trips, you've had some riders that offend, not good.
187; ;00:18:29,342 --> 00:18:35,964; ;Can you think of any specific time when you've had a hard time or faced a specific challenge driving with Uber?
188; ;00:18:40,057 --> 00:18:44,678; ;(Speaker Two) Sure, there was a guy that I picked up and he was with his friend.
189; ;00:18:44,678 --> 00:18:59,250; ;And I guess he was mad 'cause his girlfriend went to Vegas with a bunch of dudes and he was asking me my opinion and I was like, "Sir, I don't know you, I don't know your girlfriend, it's not cool to ask me this."
190; ;00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:03,858; ;And he got really angry, surprisingly, I mean, he wanted to fight me.
191; ;00:19:03,858 --> 00:19:05,102; ;And I didn't know what to do.
192; ;00:19:05,102 --> 00:19:07,891; ;So I said, "Dude, do you really want to fight?" And he said, "Yeah."
193; ;00:19:07,891 --> 00:19:09,922; ;So I pulled over and said, "All right, okay, let's fight."
194; ;00:19:09,922 --> 00:19:17,871; ;And then when he was getting down, I just drove off 'cause I didn't see any way around that, he wanted to...
195; ;00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:24,858; ;(Speaker One) So that was kind of like left a bad impression on you like that was a bad experience. (Speaker Two) No, no, no.
196; ;00:19:24,858 --> 00:19:31,638; ;Not a bad impression for as far as Uber anyways, just more towards like seeing new people who are ridiculous.
197; ;00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:38,475; ;Yeah, like I said those people are in the minority of, the vast minority of rides.
198; ;00:19:39,650 --> 00:19:50,375; ;(Speaker One) Can you think of anything that's been challenging driving with Uber like when you first started, was there anything about the sign up process that was difficult or like getting accustomed to the app or how payment worked?
199; ;00:19:53,385 --> 00:20:00,581; ;(Speaker Two) I think the hardest thing was using the native navigation what they have.
200; ;00:20:00,581 --> 00:20:11,441; ;It wasn't until maybe 20 rides in which is, we're talking about Google maps, I mean how you can tie them in together which was pretty comfortable.
201; ;00:20:11,441 --> 00:20:13,189; ;(Speaker One) So you wish you knew that like right off the bat.
202; ;00:20:13,189 --> 00:20:15,278; ;(Speaker Two) Yeah, definitely. (Speaker One) Yeah.
203; ;00:20:15,278 --> 00:20:17,356; ;Can you think of anything else that's been challenging?
204; ;00:20:20,531 --> 00:20:21,933; ;(Speaker Two) Well, it's always been pretty straight forward.
205; ;00:20:21,933 --> 00:20:34,607; ;Oh, I guess the challenging thing was the first time I filed taxes with driving with Uber but I got that all figured it and it's actually a lot easier than people make it seem.
206; ;00:20:35,763 --> 00:20:41,314; ;(Speaker One) Do you think Uber could like provide any guidance on filing taxes that would be helpful?
207; ;00:20:46,333 --> 00:20:50,844; ;(Speaker Two) No, I mean, they don't put them in a weird place liability-wise I guess.
208; ;00:20:51,988 --> 00:20:56,838; ;I just talked to a tax payer and he explained it and I was like it's that easy.
209; ;00:20:56,838 --> 00:20:59,429; ;I think that's more of the responsibility of the driver.
210; ;00:20:59,429 --> 00:21:00,456; ;(Speaker One) Okay.
211; ;00:21:05,486 --> 00:21:21,342; ;(Speaker Two) I do though think like, I think Uber should have a mentor program or maybe the first 10 rides, they will have like a veteran driver in the car with the person just to get a hang of things, you know, like show him the ropes, I guess, so to speak.
212; ;00:21:21,342 --> 00:21:22,498; ;That would be pretty awesome.
213; ;00:21:22,498 --> 00:21:25,676; ;I know a lot of drivers that would appreciate that.
214; ;00:21:25,676 --> 00:21:31,372; ;(Speaker One) So why do you think it would be helpful, just having someone there to like answer question or just to make you feel more at ease?
215; ;00:21:31,372 --> 00:21:32,380; ;(Speaker Two) Well, a few things.
216; ;00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:41,795; ;I think strangers getting into your car can be intimidating and like a lot of Uber drivers really multitask.
217; ;00:21:41,795 --> 00:21:55,407; ;Like you are watching the nav, you are watching your speed limit, you are making sure that your rider's comfortable and just someone there for that reassurance I think would be very helpful and help people integrate to the driver lifestyle a lot quicker.
218; ;00:21:55,407 --> 00:21:57,356; ;(Speaker One) Yeah, that's a really good feedback.
219; ;00:21:57,356 --> 00:21:58,375; ;(Speaker Two) Oh, thank you.
220; ;00:21:59,387 --> 00:22:03,114; ;(Speaker One) So you said driver lifestyle, can you talk more about what you mean by that?
221; ;00:22:05,042 --> 00:22:14,128; ;(Speaker Two) I think it's definitely like really fast-paced, and it can be stressful if you don't know how to cope with it.
222; ;00:22:14,128 --> 00:22:20,475; ;And there's definitely like those long nights where you'd rather be doing something else but, you know, you got to make some cash.
223; ;00:22:23,171 --> 00:22:33,676; ;And I guess it's a lot of coping with new situations 'cause I think that would be hard for people dealing with frustrations.
224; ;00:22:33,676 --> 00:22:40,050; ;But I think that's more life skills than Uber lifestyle, right? Yeah.
225; ;00:22:40,050 --> 00:22:45,850; ;(Speaker One) Can you give me examples of anything like coping with stressful situations like an example?
226; ;00:22:49,314 --> 00:22:55,692; ;(Speaker Two) Like when you have a rider that's on a time crunch but then you hit traffic and then they're complaining at you, not understanding.
227; ;00:22:58,231 --> 00:23:05,755; ;Like definitely 20-year-old me would have gotten angry but I'm just like "Oh, I can't help it, I'm sorry, I'll get you there as fast as I can." you know.
228; ;00:23:05,755 --> 00:23:09,974; ;(Speaker One) Are people usually pretty receptive to that like they understand?
229; ;00:23:09,974 --> 00:23:16,068; ;(Speaker Two) Most people, yeah, most people understand, some people get pretty lively.
230; ;00:23:17,754 --> 00:23:23,038; ;But it's not a big deal, it's never came, for me at least, it's never came into an argument or an altercation.
231; ;00:23:23,038 --> 00:23:25,971; ;(Speaker One) Yeah. (Speaker Two) And that I couldn't.
232; ;00:23:25,971 --> 00:23:29,711; ;I just make my way out off rather than coming to life with stick-ups or something.
233; ;00:23:29,711 --> 00:23:31,010; ;(Speaker One) Right.
234; ;00:23:31,010 --> 00:23:39,909; ;Do you think Uber could do anything to support drivers like may be preparing them for those kind of situations or anything like that?
235; ;00:23:39,909 --> 00:23:44,844; ;(Speaker Two) I think, yeah, they can do things to prepare them but I think it's more on the rider side.
236; ;00:23:44,844 --> 00:23:48,990; ;I think riders don't understand that us drivers are also human.
237; ;00:23:48,990 --> 00:24:04,287; ;We're gonna make mistakes, we're gonna miss turns, and then also a lot of riders, I've noticed that at least for the demographic I usually don't drive, so they get uncomfortable like when you check your blind spot and have people go like, "Why do you keep looking at me?"
238; ;00:24:04,287 --> 00:24:07,506; ;"Dude, I'm not looking at you, I swear, I'm trying to not crash."
239; ;00:24:08,957 --> 00:24:17,775; ;So I just think that I don't know, maybe Uber as a company can send out an email saying something like our drivers are human too.
240; ;00:24:19,358 --> 00:24:24,155; ;Please, also understand the rules of the road so you don't mislabel.
241; ;00:24:24,155 --> 00:24:31,895; ;Like I know I'm a very safe driver and people have said that I'm not a safe driver and that's really irritating but it is what it is, you know.
242; ;00:24:31,895 --> 00:24:34,125; ;(Speaker One) Yeah, makes sense.
243; ;00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:49,603; ;So do you think that you face any different challenges being someone who has a criminal record and driving with Uber compared to someone who doesn't have a criminal record who drives with Uber?
244; ;00:24:51,036 --> 00:24:54,360; ;(Speaker Two) No, not at all, I think all the challenges are the same all around.
245; ;00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:55,366; ;I mean...
246; ;00:25:01,867 --> 00:25:07,173; ;At least for me, personally, I don't think I faced any different challenges but other...
247; ;00:25:07,173 --> 00:25:18,875; ;(Speaker One) Can you think of maybe something, maybe not necessarily for you personally but other people who have a criminal record, can you think of any challenges that they would face that might be different from people driving that don't have a criminal record?
248; ;00:25:23,443 --> 00:25:38,540; ;(Speaker Two) Just being on the road more is increases the likelihood of maybe being pulled over or which can definitely put someone who has a previous criminal record at a high tension I guess you would say.
249; ;00:25:40,387 --> 00:25:42,689; ;And things also like.
250; ;00:25:45,630 --> 00:25:52,828; ;Some riders will have conversations about certain people with criminal records and I know that could probably make...
251; ;00:25:54,071 --> 00:26:13,555; ;It doesn't make me uncomfortable personally but someone that has more I guess "serious record" might have trouble coping with that situation and even though they are taking steps to grow as a person become a better person.
252; ;00:26:13,555 --> 00:26:15,711; ;It's really harkening, you know.
253; ;00:26:17,704 --> 00:26:21,520; ;(Speaker One) Do you mean like riders talking amongst themselves or talking to the driver?
254; ;00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:23,553; ;(Speaker Two) Oh, both, both, yeah.
255; ;00:26:23,553 --> 00:26:28,087; ;I guess riders aren't aware that some people have criminal records, some are.
256; ;00:26:30,164 --> 00:26:43,424; ;And people get a bit, I guess opinionated with things and then they wanna tell everyone about it and, you know, I refrain from that cause you don't know what's people's walks of life are, their circumstances.
257; ;00:26:43,424 --> 00:26:52,995; ;(Speaker One) Yeah, so you think it could like if riders are talking about their opinions about someone that could make a driver uncomfortable or self conscious or feel awkward, like that?
258; ;00:26:52,995 --> 00:26:55,782; ;(Speaker Two) And even drivers without criminal records also.
259; ;00:26:55,782 --> 00:26:56,910; ;(Speaker One) Yeah.
260; ;00:26:56,910 --> 00:27:01,769; ;(Speaker Two) You'd be surprised at what sort of things people talk about in the back of my car like I'm not there.
261; ;00:27:05,765 --> 00:27:07,649; ;(Speaker One) All right.
262; ;00:27:07,649 --> 00:27:15,685; ;So you kind of also talked about this before but can tell you me anything else about what it's like interacting with riders?
263; ;00:27:17,785 --> 00:27:23,007; ;(Speaker Two) Definitely for the first few minutes, it's tense, for me anyways.
264; ;00:27:23,007 --> 00:27:36,931; ;The hardest part is gauging what the rider is looking for in terms of, do they wanna just sit back and not talk and look out of the window or do they want to conversate.
265; ;00:27:36,931 --> 00:27:41,280; ;And I just have a few, personally, like...
266; ;00:27:43,297 --> 00:27:47,655; ;I guess feeler questions to see how they are.
267; ;00:27:50,013 --> 00:27:59,177; ;But for the most part, interacting with the riders is I'd say probably the hardest part and the easiest part if that makes sense I don't know how to explain it.
268; ;00:27:59,177 --> 00:28:01,662; ;(Speaker One) Yeah, probably depends on the person too.
269; ;00:28:01,662 --> 00:28:02,694; ;(Speaker Two) Definitely.
270; ;00:28:02,694 --> 00:28:12,036; ;(Speaker One) What do you say, so you said at first you were kind of like a homebody, you stayed at home a lot and then you started driving for Uber and that kind of made you a little bit more social.
271; ;00:28:13,326 --> 00:28:20,535; ;What do you say when you first started driving, that was a hard transition to socially interact with riders because you spent so much time being a homebody?
272; ;00:28:28,701 --> 00:28:29,727; ;(Speaker Two) Sorry... (Speaker One) No.
273; ;00:28:29,727 --> 00:28:31,352; ;Take your time, you think.
274; ;00:28:34,431 --> 00:28:43,953; ;(Speaker Two) I think the hardest part was interacting with them was just the fact that they were strangers. (Speaker One) Right.
275; ;00:28:43,953 --> 00:28:45,927; ;(Speaker Two) Not necessarily interacting with people.
276; ;00:28:47,303 --> 00:28:52,978; ;So I guess even like being a homebody, I still had that social life form line I guess like the gaming and things.
277; ;00:28:52,978 --> 00:28:53,998; ;(Speaker One) Yup.
278; ;00:28:56,410 --> 00:28:57,745; ;(Speaker Two) So does that answers your question at all?
279; ;00:28:57,745 --> 00:28:59,805; ;(Speaker One) Yeah. There's no right answers.
280; ;00:28:59,805 --> 00:29:01,460; ;I just want to hear what you have to say.
281; ;00:29:05,011 --> 00:29:11,277; ;So anything you dislike about conversing with riders or interacting with riders?
282; ;00:29:18,322 --> 00:29:22,781; ;(Speaker Two) No, there's only been a couple situations where it was uncomfortable.
283; ;00:29:25,325 --> 00:29:26,976; ;(Speaker One) Can you give me an example?
284; ;00:29:26,976 --> 00:29:35,482; ;(Speaker Two) Sure, I was working in Berkeley and I was near one of the protests and I picked up a bunch of people.
285; ;00:29:37,132 --> 00:29:38,874; ;And to me, like, everyone's the same.
286; ;00:29:38,874 --> 00:29:53,407; ;I don't try to categorize people or anything, you know, but the people started conversating with me about antifa and black-clad sort of things, and I guess boasting about the fact that they are punching people.
287; ;00:29:53,407 --> 00:30:07,360; ;And I wanted to just pullover and say get out of my car like that's not cool but I sucked it up and just drove until the destination and when they got out eventually, but situations like that are kind of hard to deal with.
288; ;00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:09,047; ;(Speaker One) Like you kind of feel trapped. (Speaker Two) Yeah.
289; ;00:30:09,047 --> 00:30:11,058; ;(Speaker One) You are uncomfortable with it but you also don't know what to do.
290; ;00:30:11,058 --> 00:30:20,201; ;(Speaker Two) Yeah, And that too, and I think drivers are in a place between the rating and being honest with themselves, right?
291; ;00:30:20,201 --> 00:30:27,029; ;So if they were like friends of friends and I was driving, then I would have kicked them out of the car.
292; ;00:30:27,029 --> 00:30:32,356; ;"I wouldn't care what your political roots are, I don't go around punching people, you know, get off my car."
293; ;00:30:32,356 --> 00:30:37,306; ;And then I'm like as a driver I'm like, well, I'm now like gonna get a 1 star and that's gonna screw me up, right?
294; ;00:30:37,306 --> 00:30:38,321; ;(Speaker One) Yeah.
295; ;00:30:41,113 --> 00:30:42,556; ;(Speaker Two) Yeah, I think, does...
296; ;00:30:42,556 --> 00:30:43,576; ;(Speaker One) Yeah, yeah, yeah. (Speaker Two) Okay.
297; ;00:30:46,601 --> 00:30:52,589; ;(Speaker One) All right, so when you are not driving for Uber, what kind of things do you like to do for fun?
298; ;00:30:55,264 --> 00:31:06,811; ;(Speaker Two) For fun, I love going camping and then hiking when I can and then like fishing is kind of my polar opposite of driving kind of just sit there and enjoy the scenery, right?
299; ;00:31:06,811 --> 00:31:07,823; ;(Speaker One) Yeah.
300; ;00:31:08,889 --> 00:31:11,743; ;(Speaker Two) So that's definitely...
301; ;00:31:11,743 --> 00:31:22,517; ;And then do other things like sometimes I go paintballing or a little more extreme things but mostly right now, I'm involved in homework and working.
302; ;00:31:22,517 --> 00:31:23,541; ;(Speaker One) Yeah.
303; ;00:31:23,541 --> 00:31:29,964; ;(Speaker Two) I don't really have a good balance between personal life and work and school.
304; ;00:31:29,964 --> 00:31:32,451; ;(Speaker One) So you said that you paintball. (Speaker Two) Yeah.
305; ;00:31:32,451 --> 00:31:36,899; ;(Speaker One) What are like the other like extreme sports as you call them?
306; ;00:31:36,899 --> 00:31:47,329; ;(Speaker Two) I love motor sports, so I'll try to go do some track time or things like that or go to like one of those like super fast go-kart places, It will be fun.
307; ;00:31:47,329 --> 00:31:50,027; ;(Speaker One) What do you like about those kinds of activities?
308; ;00:31:54,254 --> 00:31:55,367; ;(Speaker Two) I love going fast.
309; ;00:31:55,367 --> 00:32:01,056; ;It's just kind of this natural feeling of euphoria I guess for me personally.
310; ;00:32:02,886 --> 00:32:09,165; ;Which was a challenge for me driving with Uber because I always wanted to be heavy with my accelerator.
311; ;00:32:09,165 --> 00:32:10,170; ;(Speaker One) Right.
312; ;00:32:10,170 --> 00:32:16,054; ;(Speaker Two) But I realized it's not professional and I don't want to put people lives in danger anyway so.
313; ;00:32:16,054 --> 00:32:18,238; ;(Speaker One) So kind of like separating like hobby from driving.
314; ;00:32:18,238 --> 00:32:20,394; ;(Speaker Two) Right, exactly.
315; ;00:32:20,394 --> 00:32:21,781; ;(Speaker One) Yeah. Cool.
316; ;00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:31,136; ;Is there anything else you want to tell me, any other feedback or thoughts, things you thought of from earlier questions or really anything else?
317; ;00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:49,441; ;(Speaker Two) I think I wrote in one time on a survey but I wish there would be at least a team of drivers that is connected with the engineering department that are real time debuggers, not debuggers, but bug finders I guess.
318; ;00:32:50,787 --> 00:33:00,000; ;'Cause there are some problems with the app that happens, and then you call Support and try to tell them like, "Hey, can you forward this to engineering?"
319; ;00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,170; ;And they're like, "Sure."
320; ;00:33:01,170 --> 00:33:07,228; ;But then like nothing changes in your end and you wonder like, "Did they really forward it to engineering or did they just dismiss me," right?
321; ;00:33:10,496 --> 00:33:22,242; ;And I wish there would be like some kind of formal, not formal, just something nice but, you know, formal Uber events where drivers can meet each other and I think that is important.
322; ;00:33:24,968 --> 00:33:27,226; ;Relationships cultivated amongst drivers.
323; ;00:33:27,226 --> 00:33:32,085; ;(Speaker One) So like a more of like social setting for drivers to interact in?
324; ;00:33:32,085 --> 00:33:33,109; ;(Speaker Two) Definitely.
325; ;00:33:33,109 --> 00:33:51,809; ;I mean, there is like I guess there is kind of like camaraderie like you could see it in another Uber driver trying to merge you kind of slow down and then you are kind of like, like if they are trying to come off of the curve, you will hold traffic off for them or something, you know.
326; ;00:33:51,809 --> 00:33:53,528; ;(Speaker One) That's cool. I have never heard that before.
327; ;00:33:53,528 --> 00:33:56,733; ;(Speaker Two) Yeah, but I wish I was more cultivated.
328; ;00:34:00,258 --> 00:34:13,338; ;I think it's important for people especially in the upper echelons of management, I think like I read in the news that Kalanick, the CEO drove as the driver for a week.
329; ;00:34:15,736 --> 00:34:26,825; ;I think it's important that everyone understands what it's like to be a driver 'cause unless you have that experience, it's something to you like, "Oh, you're just driving people around."
330; ;00:34:26,825 --> 00:34:29,296; ;But it's way more depth than that.
331; ;00:34:29,296 --> 00:34:39,963; ;It's a balancing act between, you know, abiding like safety and then you have the social aspect and then...
332; ;00:34:42,050 --> 00:34:43,637; ;(Speaker One) There's just like a lot more to it than people might think.
333; ;00:34:43,637 --> 00:34:45,948; ;(Speaker Two) Exactly, it's not just people getting in your car and driving.
334; ;00:34:45,948 --> 00:34:47,552; ;(Speaker One) Yeah. (Speaker Two) It's a lot more than that.
335; ;00:34:47,552 --> 00:34:50,907; ;(Speaker One) Especially in the busy areas like the bay.
336; ;00:34:50,907 --> 00:35:03,636; ;(Speaker Two) We drive some people around the city and see how stressful it feels, you know, and then you're worried about them getting there on time but then you have you to, "Should I take this yellow light or not."
337; ;00:35:03,636 --> 00:35:06,416; ;(Speaker Two) You know... (Speaker One) Right.
338; ;00:35:06,416 --> 00:35:12,264; ;(Speaker Two) But I mean I think for the most part, Uber helps a lot of people and I really appreciate that.
339; ;00:35:12,264 --> 00:35:19,179; ;(Speaker One) Okay, and I see how you are talking about the Uber driver camaraderie like letting each other in, do you like that?
340; ;00:35:19,179 --> 00:35:22,469; ;Do you feel like you are like part of a group?
341; ;00:35:22,469 --> 00:35:27,811; ;(Speaker Two) It's not so much part of a group, it's I think people are recognizing each other struggle.
342; ;00:35:27,811 --> 00:35:34,755; ;And it doesn't even stop at just Uber drivers to Uber drivers, It's T&C drivers in general.
343; ;00:35:34,755 --> 00:35:46,787; ;They understand each other's struggle and frustrations so they are more willing to help each other and I think the world can use a little more of that, you know.
344; ;00:35:46,787 --> 00:35:48,049; ;(Speaker One) Yeah.
345; ;00:35:48,049 --> 00:35:54,975; ;So do you enjoy that aspect of it like identifying with other people who are doing the same thing as you?
346; ;00:35:57,276 --> 00:36:12,068; ;(Speaker Two) It's not, I guess, it's not so much as doing the same thing as me but appreciating another person's situation is what I enjoy the most, yeah.
347; ;00:36:12,068 --> 00:36:14,579; ;(Speaker One) Cool, all right, anything else?
348; ;00:36:19,194 --> 00:36:20,196; ;(Speaker Two) I don't think so.
349; ;00:36:21,664 --> 00:36:23,421; ;Is there anything else that...
350; ;00:36:23,421 --> 00:36:25,178; ;(Speaker One) No, I got through everything.
351; ;00:36:26,592 --> 00:36:28,932; ;Yeah, let me stop...
1; ;00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,230; ;This concludes the Unity systems administration training.
2; ;00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:10,130; ;We covered the different management and monitoring user interfaces and the Unity access control.
3; ;00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:16,200; ;We also covered the event notifications and alerts used for identifying system issues.
4; ;00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:18,200; ;So what's next?
5; ;00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:24,460; ;If you plan on taking the certification exam, you should take each one of the trainings provided in the learning center.
6; ;00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:30,660; ;Please also remember to download all the student resource guides, for a full set of study materials.
7; ;00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:36,730; ;Additionally the learning center provides access to a practice exam to further help you prepare.
8; ;00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:41,860; ;Thanks for taking the training, and good luck.
1; ;00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,230; ;Welcome to the Unity Storage Provisioning training.
2; ;00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:09,460; ;My name is Carlos Leite and I will be the instructor for this section of the course.
3; ;00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:15,130; ;In this section I will be covering the provisioning of block source resources for Xen hosts.
4; ;00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:18,700; ;And file source resources for NAS clients.
5; ;00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:27,800; ;This section also covers how to provision VMWare, VMFS, NFS and [inaudible].
6; ;00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:33,860; ;You will notice that the topics in this section have been broken into small chunks for consumption.
7; ;00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:45,330; ;As these topics are consumed, please keep in mind which aspects of storage provisioning can influence a system design for performance, capacity and resilience.
8; ;00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:48,900; ;Some features will provide storage capacity efficiency.
9; ;00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:52,760; ;Others system performance and data high availability.
10; ;00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:54,760; ;So let's get started.
1; ;00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,130; ;This concludes the storage provisioning training.
2; ;00:00:04,130 --> 00:00:09,530; ;In this section we covered the provisioning of block source resources for Xen hosts.

5; ;00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:34,960; ;Some of the storage provisioning aspects covered in this training could have determined the best approach for assistant design for performance, capacity and resilience.
6; ;00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:36,960; ;So what's next?
7; ;00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:44,230; ;If you plan on taking a certification exam, you should take each one of the training's provided in the learning center.

1; ;00:00:15,405 --> 00:00:17,310; ;(Speaker One) Excellent. Thank you so much.
2; ;00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:19,173; ;And one sign here too.
3; ;00:00:26,568 --> 00:00:29,832; ;So let me see.
4; ;00:00:29,832 --> 00:00:32,474; ;So first of all, I want to thank you for coming in today. (Speaker Two) Yeah. For sure.
5; ;00:00:32,474 --> 00:00:38,745; ;(Speaker One) Thank you for taking the time to come here and provide us feedback on how things are going.
6; ;00:00:38,745 --> 00:00:40,204; ;(Speaker Two) Cool.
7; ;00:00:40,204 --> 00:00:43,332; ;(Speaker One) So we would love to learn more about your experience driving with Uber.
8; ;00:00:43,332 --> 00:00:44,757; ;And you can say anything that you like.
9; ;00:00:44,757 --> 00:00:53,763; ;So don't feel like you can't say anything negative because if there was something that didn't work for you, we would love to hear about it because that's the only way how we can improve, right?
10; ;00:00:53,763 --> 00:00:54,907; ;(Speaker Two) Yeah. For sure, yeah.
11; ;00:00:54,907 --> 00:01:00,670; ;(Speaker One) And so we talked about it, but if it's okay with you, we'll record this session?
12; ;00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:01,727; ;(Speaker Two) Sure.
13; ;00:01:01,727 --> 00:01:12,803; ;(Speaker One) And as I told you, we'll delete the audio recordings once we've transcribed it so no one will know what you said, only me. (Speaker Two) Okay, cool.
14; ;00:01:12,803 --> 00:01:20,163; ;(Speaker One) So, yeah, anything you say, it's not going to affect your driver status or your driver account, so you don't have to worry about that.
15; ;00:01:20,163 --> 00:01:21,615; ;(Speaker One) Cool.
16; ;00:01:21,615 --> 00:01:27,235; ;(Speaker One) So first, I would love to know, could you tell me a little bit more about how you started off driving with Uber?
17; ;00:01:27,235 --> 00:01:30,128; ;(Speaker Two) Yeah, you know, I started off because...
18; ;00:01:30,128 --> 00:01:40,387; ;I moved down to Santa Cruz to open up a shop, it's like boba tea and shaved snow shop down at Capitola.
19; ;00:01:40,387 --> 00:01:42,087; ;So I moved down there.
20; ;00:01:42,087 --> 00:01:48,183; ;And then I moved down there and then it was going to be like...
21; ;00:01:48,183 --> 00:01:49,540; ;Well, I'm supposed to...
22; ;00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:54,296; ;Basically, I moved down there in like March, and then I wanted the shop opened by June.
23; ;00:01:54,296 --> 00:01:58,645; ;And then it just wasn't going to happen like permitting and construction stuff, you know.
24; ;00:01:58,645 --> 00:02:07,508; ;So then that's when I started driving Uber actually 'cause I was like there's not a lot I can do with, you know, flexibility and stuff like that.
25; ;00:02:07,508 --> 00:02:11,416; ;You know, it's not like I can go get a normal job and tell them, "Hey, I just need a job for like four months.
26; ;00:02:11,416 --> 00:02:15,920; ;I don't know when I can come again 'cause I've got a shop I'm trying to open, you know?"
27; ;00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:19,102; ;So actually, that's when I started and then...
28; ;00:02:19,102 --> 00:02:24,875; ;Yeah, so that's what got me into it, you know, really like the flexibility, and yeah.
29; ;00:02:24,875 --> 00:02:27,291; ;(Speaker One) And is your shop open now?
30; ;00:02:27,291 --> 00:02:28,488; ;(Speaker Two) Yeah, so the shop opened.
31; ;00:02:28,488 --> 00:02:31,190; ;I just had my one year last...
32; ;00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:33,579; ;On October 28th was our first year anniversary now.
33; ;00:02:33,579 --> 00:02:45,534; ;So then when it opened up, I didn't really drive a lot, you know, I was really busy with the shop and then as my employees got better and better, I've got six employees now, you know, so as they got better and better, it freed up my time.
34; ;00:02:45,534 --> 00:02:51,394; ;And then I started golfing a lot, you know, and then I was like working on another shop, like opening up for next year, you know.
35; ;00:02:51,394 --> 00:02:55,273; ;And then what happened was my buddy...
36; ;00:02:56,782 --> 00:03:06,157; ;I think it's like when you guys started like breaking up the bonuses from Monday through Thursday and then Friday through Sunday, you know, 'cause then I started off like hitting the weekend bonuses, you know.
37; ;00:03:06,157 --> 00:03:09,084; ;I was like, "Okay, I can drive again now and then."
38; ;00:03:09,084 --> 00:03:12,518; ;Now I do like probably like around 30 rides a week or something, you know.
39; ;00:03:12,518 --> 00:03:14,412; ;So like mostly weekends, you know.
40; ;00:03:14,412 --> 00:03:19,161; ;But yeah, so that's like kind of how I've been going with it.
41; ;00:03:19,161 --> 00:03:20,230; ;So yeah, it's been cool.
42; ;00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:22,385; ;Yeah, so the shop's been open for a year, so that's good.
43; ;00:03:22,385 --> 00:03:32,881; ;And now that my employees are really good, it kind of just frees me up, so like I drive some when I want and that's a nice part about it 'cause I might have like a few hours free or I might just be...
44; ;00:03:32,881 --> 00:03:41,518; ;Or maybe my employees call in sick, you know, and then I can't drive, that's something which is fine for Uber 'cause I can shut off the app, you know, but not for, you know, anything else, you know what I mean?
45; ;00:03:41,518 --> 00:03:42,890; ;And so that's what's nice.
46; ;00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:46,025; ;(Speaker One) Yeah. And how do you decide when to drive or...
47; ;00:03:46,025 --> 00:03:47,581; ;(Speaker Two) Well, usually it's like...
48; ;00:03:47,581 --> 00:03:51,087; ;I'll usually just decide by like the...
49; ;00:03:51,087 --> 00:03:52,787; ;Usually by like the weekday bonus, you know?
50; ;00:03:52,787 --> 00:04:02,419; ;So, like, if the weekday bonus is like something really high, you know, then I'm probably not going to drive a lot 'cause if it's like 60 rides, you know, then I'm probably not going to get 60 rides in just 'cause like...
51; ;00:04:04,232 --> 00:04:09,764; ;You know, well, one, it's Santa Cruz, so to get like a lot of rides, you know, Santa Cruz is way better on the weekends.
52; ;00:04:09,764 --> 00:04:17,636; ;But on the weekdays, if I want to hit 60 rides on a weekday, then I'd have to come up to San Jose most likely, you know what I mean?
53; ;00:04:17,636 --> 00:04:19,971; ;And then, you know, it's away from the shop.
54; ;00:04:19,971 --> 00:04:25,789; ;And, you know, that's like a lot more stuff, whereas on the weekends, I can hit the bonuses 'cause it's, you know, real busy in Santa Cruz, a lot of people come in town.
55; ;00:04:25,789 --> 00:04:30,984; ;You know, and I don't really go out a lot anyway at night, so driving is perfect, you know.
56; ;00:04:30,984 --> 00:04:32,393; ;(Speaker One) Yeah.
57; ;00:04:32,393 --> 00:04:34,713; ;It sounds like you can combine it pretty well with your shop.
58; ;00:04:34,713 --> 00:04:35,757; ;(Speaker Two) Yeah. Yeah.
59; ;00:04:35,757 --> 00:04:41,073; ;It combines really good with my shop 'cause I can go like five days without driving or I can like drive...
60; ;00:04:41,073 --> 00:04:45,574; ;A few weeks ago, I had a lot of free time, and I drove a ton of rides during the week, you know what I mean?
61; ;00:04:45,574 --> 00:04:47,055; ;So that's nice, you know.
62; ;00:04:47,055 --> 00:04:48,187; ;(Speaker One) Yeah. Yeah.
63; ;00:04:48,187 --> 00:04:53,655; ;And what are one or two things that you like about driving with Uber?
64; ;00:04:53,655 --> 00:04:55,654; ;(Speaker Two) Number one is definitely flexibility.
65; ;00:04:55,654 --> 00:04:59,273; ;And then two would probably be...
66; ;00:05:00,478 --> 00:05:05,965; ;Um, two would be I guess...
67; ;00:05:05,965 --> 00:05:10,632; ;I'm not sure if it's either like pay or the people, you know, 'cause like I'm a people person anyway, you know.
68; ;00:05:10,632 --> 00:05:17,060; ;So I like talking to people and especially, like, with the locals there in Santa Cruz, you know, they always ask about the shop or something or like ask what we do.
69; ;00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:18,445; ;(Speaker One) Oh, they know you?
70; ;00:05:18,445 --> 00:05:20,666; ;(Speaker Two) Well, they'll say like, you know...
71; ;00:05:20,666 --> 00:05:22,593; ;They'll say like...
72; ;00:05:22,593 --> 00:05:26,460; ;They'll either read it in the profile, you know, or they always ask, like, "Oh, do you..."
73; ;00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:31,051; ;You get the same question like how long have you been driving, you know, it's like the same stuff, you know.
74; ;00:05:31,051 --> 00:05:35,317; ;Then they'll usually ask like, "So is Uber your full-time or do you do something else?"
75; ;00:05:35,317 --> 00:05:37,622; ;And then that segue to that, you know, and then it's like...
76; ;00:05:37,622 --> 00:05:40,869; ;So I've actually, like, made a lot of cool connections through Uber, you know.
77; ;00:05:40,869 --> 00:05:48,766; ;And just like, I don't know, really like an index full of business cards just from talking to people, you know what I mean?
78; ;00:05:48,766 --> 00:05:50,420; ;They're really nice and like, "Oh, here's my card."
79; ;00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:53,090; ;You know, yadda yadda, for whatever reason, you know.
80; ;00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:58,070; ;And so that's really cool, you know, just like networking and stuff, just like non-intentional networking.
81; ;00:05:58,070 --> 00:05:59,899; ;It's like a nice little bonus, you know.
82; ;00:05:59,899 --> 00:06:04,928; ;Some people always like stick to their own stuff, and that's totally cool, I can go either way.
83; ;00:06:04,928 --> 00:06:12,001; ;You know, if no one wants to talk, I'm like super cool or if someone's like really inquisitive, I don't mind telling them stuff, you know, so that goes real well.
84; ;00:06:12,001 --> 00:06:18,480; ;Then I've made like a lot of connections down at Santa Cruz just from that, you know, just like, you know, tell them like "Hey, if you..."
85; ;00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,695; ;And they're like, "Oh, you know, I'm going to stop by the shop sometime."
86; ;00:06:20,695 --> 00:06:28,494; ;And I'll just tell them, "Hey, if I'm not there, tell my employees that Shaye drove you in Uber, you know, and they'll give like a dollar off the items and stuff, you know.
87; ;00:06:28,494 --> 00:06:32,148; ;So I tell my employees, you know, "hey, I'm sending some people in, yadda yadda."
88; ;00:06:32,148 --> 00:06:34,193; ;I don't know, it just works out really cool. You know what I mean?
89; ;00:06:34,193 --> 00:06:38,159; ;So that's cool when they ask about that.
90; ;00:06:38,159 --> 00:06:42,757; ;You know, so it's like a nice little added bonus like for me personally, you know.
91; ;00:06:42,757 --> 00:06:51,914; ;But yeah, number one is flexibility, second's like either people or money 'cause like the weekend, you know, like surges and especially when it's busy on the weekends, it's really good, you know.
92; ;00:06:51,914 --> 00:07:00,582; ;Especially for something like part-time and non-committal, you know what I mean, to make that is good and like not labor-intensive and not...
93; ;00:07:00,582 --> 00:07:03,124; ;So that's good. Yeah.
94; ;00:07:03,124 --> 00:07:04,404; ;(Speaker One) Yeah.
95; ;00:07:04,404 --> 00:07:08,994; ;And what are one of the things that you dislike about Uber?
96; ;00:07:08,994 --> 00:07:21,265; ;(Speaker Two) Well, I think some of the stuff you changed like the long trip stuff helps a lot, you know, long trip notification helps with time because especially with me like, you know, if I'm in Santa Cruz...
97; ;00:07:21,265 --> 00:07:23,874; ;Well, you know, I drive a lot on like...
98; ;00:07:23,874 --> 00:07:34,137; ;So for my boba tea shop, my main distributors are in Hayward, you know, so one thing that's really good is the destination filters, you know, because I use that when I go up to Hayward.
99; ;00:07:34,137 --> 00:07:39,655; ;So like every Monday or Tuesday, I will set my destination, you know, kind of hang around near my house, wait and see if I get a ride over there.
100; ;00:07:39,655 --> 00:07:43,208; ;And if not, I'll start heading over and I'd get a ride somewhere there and on the way back too.
101; ;00:07:43,208 --> 00:07:54,195; ;So that's really good, but, you know, what used to kind of suck was you pull up with someone and it's like maybe I have, like, 40 minutes of drive left, you know, and it's just like "Oh, I'm going to the airport."
102; ;00:07:54,195 --> 00:07:58,516; ;You know, it's a 45 minute drive, and it's like that awkward, "Oh, I'm sorry."
103; ;00:07:58,516 --> 00:08:00,339; ;Some people are cool about it. Some people are like, "Oh!"
104; ;00:08:00,339 --> 00:08:01,720; ;You know, they think they still...
105; ;00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:04,068; ;They think that we could still like see the destination and stuff.
106; ;00:08:04,068 --> 00:08:05,194; ;They're like that, "Why do you accept it then?"
107; ;00:08:05,194 --> 00:08:08,836; ;It's like, "Oh, I can't see it until I start the trip," you know, yadda yadda.
108; ;00:08:08,836 --> 00:08:15,520; ;So now that the long trip notifications came up, that helps a lot, you know, 'cause that was like one of my...
109; ;00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:18,862; ;For me personally, it's like, I'd be like, "Ah, bummer."
110; ;00:08:18,862 --> 00:08:24,134; ;You know, like I have a lot of time constraints, you know, so that helps a lot, you know.
111; ;00:08:26,202 --> 00:08:29,093; ;But as far as like the bad stuff, we're probably just like...
112; ;00:08:32,498 --> 00:08:33,700; ;I'm trying to think.
113; ;00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:37,677; ;I think 'cause that was like my big...
114; ;00:08:37,677 --> 00:08:43,315; ;That was probably like one of my biggest ones is like knowing when to stop driving, but the long trips helps that, you know.
115; ;00:08:43,315 --> 00:08:51,839; ;So I guess my main thing now after that would be, like, I don't know, maybe it's something like...
116; ;00:08:55,890 --> 00:08:59,655; ;I don't know, it's hard to say, like maybe just like I think...
117; ;00:08:59,655 --> 00:09:03,712; ;And I think, oh, you know, one of the things was I think you guys changed it now.
118; ;00:09:03,712 --> 00:09:12,181; ;You know, I haven't checked it yet, but I think you guys are like paying more or charging the customers more for like long pickups or something I think.
119; ;00:09:12,181 --> 00:09:14,662; ;I thought I saw that on the email, maybe not.
120; ;00:09:14,662 --> 00:09:22,841; ;I don't know if that's part of the 180 Days of Change, but if so, that's cool too 'cause it's like sometimes I wouldn't mind picking up someone that's like...
121; ;00:09:22,841 --> 00:09:25,398; ;Especially in Santa Cruz since there's like not as many drivers, you know?
122; ;00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:32,927; ;You get all these requests for like 18 minutes away and 15 minutes, it's like, no, thank you 'cause it's like, you go there and it's like a one-mile ride, you're like, "Dang."
123; ;00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:37,812; ;So I thought I saw something where like they're going to start doing that which would be cool, you know. And then...
124; ;00:09:37,812 --> 00:09:43,514; ;'Cause I know as a driver, like when I first moved to Santa Cruz and I always had like 20-minute waits, like when Uber first got there, you know.
125; ;00:09:43,514 --> 00:09:48,074; ;Now it's a lot better, but when Uber first got to Santa Cruz, it was like kind of when I first moved in there.
126; ;00:09:48,074 --> 00:09:50,040; ;That's actually why I started driving 'cause it was like...
127; ;00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:53,659; ;I called an Uber, it was like 20 minutes, and whoa, I wasn't used to that being from Sacramento.
128; ;00:09:53,659 --> 00:09:55,511; ;I was like, "Wow, that's a long time."
129; ;00:09:55,511 --> 00:09:57,907; ;You know, and I was like, "Well, I should drive. You know, they need drivers."
130; ;00:09:57,907 --> 00:10:04,313; ;And that's how I started, but, you know, I was thinking, I was like, "I wouldn't mind paying more" 'cause I wasn't getting rides.
131; ;00:10:04,313 --> 00:10:06,098; ;You know, people were canceling on me 'cause I was so far.
132; ;00:10:06,098 --> 00:10:10,807; ;And I was like dang, you know, I was like, "I wouldn't mind like paying a couple of bucks more to have someone come and get me."
133; ;00:10:10,807 --> 00:10:17,569; ;You know what I mean, if there are so few drivers, you know, but...
134; ;00:10:17,569 --> 00:10:24,562; ;I don't know, I've had a pretty good experience with Uber as far as that's concerned because like the...
135; ;00:10:24,562 --> 00:10:32,527; ;Yeah, to be honest, there's not too much bad stuff, like I think maybe like the...
136; ;00:10:32,527 --> 00:10:40,985; ;I don't know if it's 75 cents here in the Bay or something, but it's like more in Santa Cruz, you know, the per mile, you know, so that's like one incentive I have for sticking out there too, you know.
137; ;00:10:40,985 --> 00:10:43,173; ;It's like well I don't want to come over the hill.
138; ;00:10:45,690 --> 00:10:49,654; ;I know the pay is a little bit less here, but I don't know overall like...
139; ;00:10:49,654 --> 00:10:51,007; ;(Speaker One) It's less than in...
140; ;00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:52,219; ;(Speaker Two) Santa Cruz, yeah.
141; ;00:10:52,219 --> 00:10:59,060; ;'Cause Santa Cruz was like, I don't know if it still is, but it has been like the same as San Francisco.
142; ;00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:01,055; ;So San Francisco and Santa Cruz were the same, you know.
143; ;00:11:01,055 --> 00:11:06,402; ;And then they have the Bay area prices, you know, like a little bit less, and then East Bay even less than that, you know.
144; ;00:11:09,455 --> 00:11:12,354; ;I don't know, that's not a lot.
145; ;00:11:12,354 --> 00:11:21,702; ;I had a couple of issues with the UberEATS, but that's like not on your guys' end, it's basically just like, you know, park in something like the busier places, you know, just like trying to get out and get the food, you know, but that's not on your end.
146; ;00:11:21,702 --> 00:11:23,386; ;(Speaker One) You did UberEATS trips?
147; ;00:11:23,386 --> 00:11:24,724; ;(Speaker Two) Yeah, exactly.
148; ;00:11:24,724 --> 00:11:28,315; ;And then I'd give a feedback on there as far as like difficulty parking on there and stuff.
149; ;00:11:28,315 --> 00:11:36,317; ;But that was kind of few and far between and nothing like on your end, you know, just, like a bib, you know, like, Mountain View, Castro, it's always going to be busy.
150; ;00:11:36,317 --> 00:11:39,367; ;So it's not, you know, not much to do there, so...
151; ;00:11:39,367 --> 00:11:41,822; ;(Speaker One) Do you do both UberEATS and Uber?
152; ;00:11:41,822 --> 00:11:43,398; ;(Speaker Two) Yeah, I do both.
153; ;00:11:43,398 --> 00:11:44,618; ;Oh, yeah, exactly.
154; ;00:11:44,618 --> 00:11:47,139; ;(Speaker One) And do have a preference for either one of them?
155; ;00:11:47,139 --> 00:11:53,926; ;(Speaker Two) Well, you know, it actually depends because, like, the nice thing about Uber, you know...
156; ;00:11:53,926 --> 00:11:56,575; ;I like talking to people, you know, so that's cool, you know, and then picking them up.
157; ;00:11:56,575 --> 00:11:59,092; ;And then the least...
158; ;00:11:59,092 --> 00:12:04,368; ;The part I like the least about UberEATS is like getting out and having to take it places, you know, to be honest.
159; ;00:12:04,368 --> 00:12:05,416; ;If it's like...
160; ;00:12:05,416 --> 00:12:09,997; ;'Cause, like, when I drive to San Jose, it's like all these gated apartments, and then it's like a high rise, and I'm just like, "Oh, man!"
161; ;00:12:09,997 --> 00:12:11,039; ;I'm like, "Here we go."
162; ;00:12:11,039 --> 00:12:14,152; ;And then I'm looking at the thing, and it's like please bring this to floor 37.
163; ;00:12:14,152 --> 00:12:15,525; ;I'm like, "Oh, of course."
164; ;00:12:15,525 --> 00:12:17,624; ;And I'm like looking at the parking, I'm like, "Okay."
165; ;00:12:17,624 --> 00:12:19,494; ;That's the part I'm like, "Uh!"
166; ;00:12:19,494 --> 00:12:22,957; ;But, you know, then you have the people who are just like come right out to the street and you're like, "Yes!"
167; ;00:12:22,957 --> 00:12:25,176; ;It's so convenient, you know what I mean.
168; ;00:12:25,176 --> 00:12:31,751; ;And the nice part is like being in my position, UberEATS is a little bit better for me because of the...
169; ;00:12:33,776 --> 00:12:35,223; ;You know, I'm usually like multitasking.
170; ;00:12:35,223 --> 00:12:39,386; ;You know, If I don't have a passenger, it's like I have to call people 'cause I'm trying to...
171; ;00:12:39,386 --> 00:12:42,497; ;My family has a shop just like mine in Sacramento, that's where I started.
172; ;00:12:42,497 --> 00:12:45,734; ;And we're in the midst of re-branding that one, you know, to be like mine.
173; ;00:12:45,734 --> 00:12:53,515; ;So, you know, I have a lot of phone calls and stuff or if I get a call from the shop, you know, it's nice to like, you know, sometimes I'll get a call from a Uber passenger, right?
174; ;00:12:53,515 --> 00:12:54,815; ;I'm looking at the call, I'm like, "Oh, man!"
175; ;00:12:54,815 --> 00:12:56,793; ;You know, I'm like looking at my... "When do I drop this guy off?"
176; ;00:12:56,793 --> 00:13:02,041; ;You know, like, so I'm thinking like the next nine minutes of the trip, I'm like, "Okay, we could have been calling."
177; ;00:13:02,041 --> 00:13:04,882; ;You know, hopefully, they send a text and I can see the top line or something, you know.
178; ;00:13:04,882 --> 00:13:09,541; ;I'm just like hopefully, it wasn't an emergency, yadda yadda, but then they never call twice, whatever, you know.
179; ;00:13:09,541 --> 00:13:14,850; ;But like in UberEATS it's nice 'cause I'm like, Oh, I'm still doing the job," you know, and I might have a call.
180; ;00:13:14,850 --> 00:13:16,821; ;And then maybe there's like, "Oh, we need this at the shop."
181; ;00:13:16,821 --> 00:13:18,809; ;And I'm like, "Oh, perfect, and I can get that call."
182; ;00:13:18,809 --> 00:13:25,476; ;So they have their pros and cons, you know, so that's why I have both on when I'm up here 'cause I don't mind either, you know.
183; ;00:13:25,476 --> 00:13:27,074; ;And then what's nice about the...
184; ;00:13:27,074 --> 00:13:32,397; ;I guess it's the same as UberPool too, but it's nice having the, you know, when you get the stacked orders on UberEATS, you know.
185; ;00:13:32,397 --> 00:13:40,101; ;So like you're at Panda Express and get two different orders, you know, so that's always nice, two in the same spot, which I guess would be similar to getting like the Pool rides.
186; ;00:13:40,101 --> 00:13:41,308; ;Yeah, it's cool.
187; ;00:13:41,308 --> 00:13:47,565; ;(Speaker One) Yeah. Yeah, it's interesting to see, to hear that you see advantages to both of them.
188; ;00:13:47,565 --> 00:13:51,315; ;(Speaker Two) Yeah, for sure, yeah, both sides.
189; ;00:13:51,315 --> 00:13:59,089; ;(Speaker One) How much longer do you think you'll be driving with Uber and what things would make you more or less likely to continue driving with Uber?
190; ;00:13:59,089 --> 00:14:02,257; ;(Speaker Two) Let's see. For me, you know, it's a good question.
191; ;00:14:02,257 --> 00:14:04,624; ;I'm not sure how long I'll drive 'cause it's just like...
192; ;00:14:04,624 --> 00:14:10,974; ;I'll go through like spurts, you know, a lot of driving or like a little just depending on my business, you know.
193; ;00:14:10,974 --> 00:14:14,736; ;So it's hard to say.
194; ;00:14:14,736 --> 00:14:21,788; ;But as far as what would make me like more and less inclined would be...
195; ;00:14:21,788 --> 00:14:31,105; ;I guess less inclined would be like I guess like less pay would be less inclined, you know, 'cause like I'm right at the perfect amount like where when I drive and with bonuses and everything.
196; ;00:14:31,105 --> 00:14:38,154; ;I make what I need to make to drive Uber, you know what I mean, like factor in cars, you know, can factor all the stuff in.
197; ;00:14:38,154 --> 00:14:46,155; ;So right now, it's at a good place with that, so I'm like, "Okay, cool," you know, so like if that dropped, then that would be hard and I'd be kind of wanting more, but like okay.
199; ;00:14:50,830 --> 00:14:54,040; ;What else? As far as like less inclined to drive would just be...
200; ;00:14:57,882 --> 00:15:03,023; ;It would be tough to drive without like the bonuses for me, you know.
201; ;00:15:03,023 --> 00:15:04,561; ;So I guess that factors into pay, you know.
202; ;00:15:04,561 --> 00:15:07,852; ;So like I see the bonuses and that like factors a lot in.
203; ;00:15:07,852 --> 00:15:14,616; ;You know what I mean, 'cause I'll see a good one on the weekend, I'm like, "Okay, I'm definitely going to hit that one," and I'll just start driving a lot, you know what I mean, just getting that mindset, you know.
204; ;00:15:14,616 --> 00:15:19,137; ;Or if on a like Sunday night, I see the bonus, it's like not that great, then I start planning different stuff for the weekend.
205; ;00:15:19,137 --> 00:15:29,052; ;I'm like, okay, I'm going to hang around more local this week, you know, and I want to focus more on like getting some flyers out for the schools this week or, you know, a lot of local stuff, you know.
206; ;00:15:29,052 --> 00:15:33,222; ;And so that's how I kind of decide that.
207; ;00:15:33,222 --> 00:15:35,605; ;And then as far as like more likely to drive...
208; ;00:15:38,004 --> 00:15:42,589; ;More likely to drive, I like this stuff, I like the 180 Days of Change stuff.
209; ;00:15:42,589 --> 00:15:45,560; ;You know, pretty much all those have been like really good stuff.
210; ;00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:50,978; ;The tipping was a big one, you know what I mean, 'cause that's been really good especially for me, I just seem to get tips, you know, so that's...
198; ;00:14:46,155 --> 00:14:49,583; ;And then what else?
211; ;00:15:50,978 --> 00:15:52,072; ;(Speaker One) So it makes a huge difference?
212; ;00:15:52,072 --> 00:16:03,486; ;(Speaker Two) Yeah, you know, it really does, you know, especially 'cause some people obviously aren't going to talk a lot like yadda yadda and, you know, there's different drivers and some people are, you know, really closed off and stuff, which is totally fine, whatever.
213; ;00:16:03,486 --> 00:16:12,190; ;But, you know, for people that like talking stuff, like me, I think it makes even a bigger difference, you know, 'cause people used to always ask, "Okay, a tip on app, I don't have my card and stuff."
214; ;00:16:12,190 --> 00:16:15,503; ;And I was always just like, "No worries anyway 'cause I'm not like that anyway."
215; ;00:16:15,503 --> 00:16:20,528; ;But it's nice to have the choice, you know, and now I see the tips coming up, I'm like, "Oh, cool."
216; ;00:16:20,528 --> 00:16:23,687; ;So I look after the day and I see the tips, and some are like real nice.
217; ;00:16:23,687 --> 00:16:26,120; ;So I'm like, "Okay, that's cool."
218; ;00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:32,030; ;So just to see the difference, you know, especially like before 'cause I used to drive for Uber and Lyft, you know.
219; ;00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:36,372; ;So that was a nice part about Lyft 'cause I used to get a good amount of tips on that, you know, just chatting with people, you know.
220; ;00:16:36,372 --> 00:16:44,932; ;So yeah, and then when I stopped driving for Lyft was just when they...
221; ;00:16:44,932 --> 00:16:51,801; ;I just didn't get my car registered again through Lyft, you know, because you guys had a slot at Jiffy Lube down in Santa Cruz, you know, so I was like, oh, cool.
222; ;00:16:51,801 --> 00:16:55,779; ;So I got my annual inspection through you guys, you know.
223; ;00:16:55,779 --> 00:16:59,903; ;And then Lyft was going to have me go up to San Jose, you know, and I was just like, "Oh!"
224; ;00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:02,172; ;And that's when I started driving as much.
225; ;00:17:02,172 --> 00:17:09,995; ;And you guys were having like the weekday and the weekend bonuses, so I couldn't hit those if I was driving for Lyft also, you know, so I just consolidated.
226; ;00:17:09,995 --> 00:17:15,873; ;I was like, "I'm just like full Uber now," like the last year or whatever that's been.
227; ;00:17:15,873 --> 00:17:18,865; ;You know, so that's been good there.
228; ;00:17:18,865 --> 00:17:24,097; ;But I don't know, more or less inclined to drive...
229; ;00:17:24,097 --> 00:17:29,459; ;I guess that would be most of the stuff 'cause the 180 days, that helped a lot.
230; ;00:17:29,459 --> 00:17:32,875; ;And I know it would be nice to have like...
231; ;00:17:32,875 --> 00:17:41,561; ;If I had like one more destination filter, that would be awesome, you know, 'cause when you guys bumped it up to six, you know, I was like, "That's cool, but I don't need six," you know.
232; ;00:17:41,561 --> 00:17:43,771; ;I was like, "That's a lot."
233; ;00:17:43,771 --> 00:17:49,352; ;And three is like so cool 'cause like it allows me to...
234; ;00:17:49,352 --> 00:18:03,435; ;So, you know, so I can do a destination out here to San Jose, you know, drive a bunch, you know, like for instance today, so since I'm out here today, so I did some rides today, I'm going to do this meeting, I'm going to do some more rides, and I've got to go to Hayward, you know.
235; ;00:18:03,435 --> 00:18:12,010; ;So I did a destination earlier here, and then I've got to go to Hayward, you know, so I'd like to use destination to go there, but then I start to go home to Santa Cruz, you know.
236; ;00:18:12,010 --> 00:18:19,802; ;So if I had like three, that would be perfect because I can like come out to a driving destination, you know, use one more destination and do that, which would be cool.
237; ;00:18:19,802 --> 00:18:21,237; ;(Speaker One) Yeah.
238; ;00:18:24,022 --> 00:18:28,764; ;(Speaker Two) But then, you know, that's probably like a more unique situation to me, you know, so that's like...
239; ;00:18:28,764 --> 00:18:34,300; ;So it might just be like a little outlier, so not like the most important thing, but that's just a personal thing.
240; ;00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:36,406; ;(Speaker One) Yeah. That's good feedback.
242; ;00:18:38,694 --> 00:18:40,978; ;(Speaker Two) Oh, yeah, for sure that. And if...
243; ;00:18:40,978 --> 00:18:49,177; ;You know, I know it's like hard, but it's like I wish there was like a way to like...
244; ;00:18:49,177 --> 00:18:54,115; ;Well, I know everything's gonna improve and there's already been like a lot of improvements with it, you know, but there is...
245; ;00:18:55,675 --> 00:19:05,432; ;You know, I feel it could get even better as far as like just the efficiency of driving.
246; ;00:19:05,432 --> 00:19:10,521; ;So like before when you guys had it where you can like, where you already knew where the person was going, you know.
247; ;00:19:10,521 --> 00:19:12,940; ;So maybe that's a little too...
248; ;00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:22,556; ;You know, maybe that's like a little too swayed towards the driver then, you know, and so I get like not showing it, you know, people cherry picking and stuff like that, you know.
249; ;00:19:22,556 --> 00:19:27,524; ;But it's almost like if there's like a way for like either...
250; ;00:19:27,524 --> 00:19:40,728; ;I don't know, not necessarily like VIP drivers or something to see, maybe if you have really high rating to be incentivized for like seeing the destinations or something 'cause there's so many times where it's like you can see a destination and it's just like...
241; ;00:18:36,406 --> 00:18:38,694; ;You really appreciate those options.
251; ;00:19:42,664 --> 00:19:44,852; ;I don't know, it just helps a lot, but...
252; ;00:19:44,852 --> 00:19:46,165; ;I don't know.
253; ;00:19:46,165 --> 00:19:50,160; ;Like obviously seeing the destination helps the driver a lot just in general, you know.
254; ;00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:56,014; ;But then obviously from a business standpoint, right, you can't give them everything, right?
255; ;00:19:56,014 --> 00:19:57,736; ;So I get that part, you know.
256; ;00:19:57,736 --> 00:19:58,989; ;So I'm trying to think of like...
257; ;00:19:58,989 --> 00:20:09,108; ;And I know obviously you guys are qualified people, but, you know, trying to think of a way to like have it be closer to that without like giving out all the information or something 'cause there are so many times...
258; ;00:20:09,108 --> 00:20:15,966; ;I don't know. Even if there's like an area pod it showed or something 'cause there's so many times where I'm like, man, like, I wouldn't have taken this...
259; ;00:20:15,966 --> 00:20:17,021; ;You know, it's like...
260; ;00:20:17,021 --> 00:20:19,568; ;Sometimes it's like I wouldn't have taken this drive, you know.
261; ;00:20:19,568 --> 00:20:23,014; ;And I get it, that would be bad for the customer, you know.
262; ;00:20:23,014 --> 00:20:24,914; ;But I don't know, there's been...
263; ;00:20:24,914 --> 00:20:28,033; ;Like for instance, there's been drives where it's like...
264; ;00:20:30,194 --> 00:20:35,073; ;Like in Santa Cruz for instance, like I'm in a certain spot, you know, and it's not even like...
265; ;00:20:35,073 --> 00:20:40,162; ;And I don't want to use destination filter 'cause it's such like a small area and stuff and like I still want the rides.
266; ;00:20:40,162 --> 00:20:51,117; ;But it's like I wish I could see where they're going 'cause sometimes it's like I wouldn't want that ride, you know, 'cause it takes me like way out of the way, you know...
267; ;00:20:51,117 --> 00:20:52,599; ;Not way out of the way, but it's like.
268; ;00:20:52,599 --> 00:20:59,411; ;You know, say if I had half an hour to drive and it's not like a necessity I have to go somewhere, you know, but I'm like I don't want to drive for half an hour, I'm kind of tired, whatever, you know.
269; ;00:20:59,411 --> 00:21:03,967; ;And then you get that one ride where it's like, you know, 20 minutes just the opposite way.
270; ;00:21:03,967 --> 00:21:06,467; ;And then I'm like, "Man, if I could have seen that like..."
271; ;00:21:06,467 --> 00:21:10,752; ;You know, if I could have like seen the address or like what general direction they're going or something, you know, I could have like...
272; ;00:21:10,752 --> 00:21:13,796; ;(Speaker One) And you don't feel comfortable canceling at that moment?
273; ;00:21:13,796 --> 00:21:16,702; ;(Speaker Two) Well, I've had to. You know what I mean?
274; ;00:21:16,702 --> 00:21:22,291; ;So like when I show up to someone, you know, maybe it's like, you know, so like for mine, it's mostly the UCSC, UC, Santa Cruz.
275; ;00:21:22,291 --> 00:21:28,133; ;You know, so it's like driving 12 minutes like up this windy road and like way out there, kind of out in the middle of nowhere, you know.
276; ;00:21:28,133 --> 00:21:29,223; ;So that's mainly for me.
277; ;00:21:29,223 --> 00:21:31,699; ;So like if I get there, it's like kind of pick or choose.
278; ;00:21:31,699 --> 00:21:32,853; ;Almost like what kind of mood I'm in.
279; ;00:21:32,853 --> 00:21:36,087; ;You know, so it's like if I really don't want to drive or if I'm tired or something, I'm like, "Oh, I'm so sorry.
280; ;00:21:36,087 --> 00:21:37,677; ;You know, I can't go out that way.
281; ;00:21:37,677 --> 00:21:43,790; ;'Cause even though it's only 15 minutes that way, then I have to drive like 30 minutes back home, you know, 'cause I was already heading that way kind of, you know."
282; ;00:21:43,790 --> 00:21:49,729; ;So it's kind of like that, but I don't have like...
284; ;00:21:50,865 --> 00:21:54,688; ;You know, I take it and then it's kind of like a begrudgingly take, and then you're like, "Oh!"
285; ;00:21:54,688 --> 00:21:56,821; ;You know, so that's not funny in any way 'cause...
286; ;00:21:56,821 --> 00:22:02,655; ;Well, that's good 'cause they get there, you know, like right on time but then you're like, you're probably not going to get your best experience 'cause you're kind of like grumpy.
287; ;00:22:02,655 --> 00:22:04,368; ;You know, like you're driving that way, so like...
283; ;00:21:49,729 --> 00:21:50,865; ;Or sometimes I take it.
288; ;00:22:04,368 --> 00:22:06,314; ;Maybe you're kind of short that you're like, okay.
289; ;00:22:08,498 --> 00:22:11,898; ;But I mean, I've had to tell people like, when I get there, I'm like, "Oh, you're going there.
290; ;00:22:11,898 --> 00:22:13,494; ;You know, I'm sorry, I can't.
291; ;00:22:13,494 --> 00:22:16,405; ;And I apologize." And they're like, "Oh, what?"
292; ;00:22:16,405 --> 00:22:17,588; ;You know, sometimes they're like...
293; ;00:22:17,588 --> 00:22:20,921; ;Some people are cool. They're like, "Okay, get it," and stuff 'cause we have like...
294; ;00:22:20,921 --> 00:22:22,853; ;I don't know if you know have heard of like Felton...
295; ;00:22:22,853 --> 00:22:25,128; ;You've probably heard of like Felton and stuff.
296; ;00:22:25,128 --> 00:22:26,361; ;Okay, so like...
297; ;00:22:26,361 --> 00:22:27,621; ;So some people like...
298; ;00:22:27,621 --> 00:22:32,027; ;The worst is at night, you're like, "Okay, I'm going to make a lot tonight," yadda yadda, you know.
299; ;00:22:32,027 --> 00:22:37,284; ;And it's like 1:20 and you're like, waiting for like that 1:45 surge and stuff, you know.
300; ;00:22:37,284 --> 00:22:41,247; ;And then it's like someone from like at 1:20 is going to like Felton.
301; ;00:22:41,247 --> 00:22:44,814; ;And then that will take me like 30 minutes up in the hills where it's like...
302; ;00:22:44,814 --> 00:22:46,827; ;I have issues like ending the ride.
303; ;00:22:46,827 --> 00:22:49,726; ;You know what I mean, like it's that bad reception when you go up there.
304; ;00:22:49,726 --> 00:23:00,813; ;So you're like driving 30 minutes up there, windy road at night, and then you've got to drive back and there's no way you're gonna get a ride there 'cause, you know, they live in a cabin, so you're like driving back, and it's like, you know.
305; ;00:23:00,813 --> 00:23:03,328; ;You know, those situations are tough 'cause someone's got to bite the bullet.
306; ;00:23:03,328 --> 00:23:05,492; ;You know what I mean? Like not everyone can win in that situation.
307; ;00:23:05,492 --> 00:23:08,096; ;They're like they live far away and they need to get home, you know what I mean.
308; ;00:23:08,096 --> 00:23:09,165; ;And then...
309; ;00:23:10,558 --> 00:23:12,731; ;So those are just like the... I don't know.
310; ;00:23:12,731 --> 00:23:20,564; ;Like I don't know if it's like, you know, costs more for them to get home or what, you know, but it's like, it's hard to have a winner in that situation, you know what I mean?
311; ;00:23:20,564 --> 00:23:21,814; ;So it's like I don't know what to do.
312; ;00:23:21,814 --> 00:23:23,778; ;You know, I don't have an answer.
313; ;00:23:23,778 --> 00:23:27,726; ;Those are just like the only I guess like...
314; ;00:23:27,726 --> 00:23:29,866; ;Not even like a bad situation, but just like slightly irritating.
315; ;00:23:29,866 --> 00:23:30,973; ;(Speaker One) Things you don't like.
316; ;00:23:30,973 --> 00:23:32,655; ;(Speaker Two) Like, "Oh, man! Bummer." You know what I mean?
317; ;00:23:32,655 --> 00:23:35,829; ;Like the rest is like super chill, you know what I mean, like I meet cool people and stuff.
318; ;00:23:35,829 --> 00:23:36,882; ;(Speaker One) Yeah.
319; ;00:23:36,882 --> 00:23:37,948; ;(Speaker Two) But those are, you know, that's it.
320; ;00:23:37,948 --> 00:23:41,176; ;So I don't have an answer for it, but that's just where I'm coming from.
321; ;00:23:41,176 --> 00:23:43,165; ;(Speaker One) Yeah, that's helpful, yeah.
322; ;00:23:43,165 --> 00:23:46,667; ;And does driving with Uber help you make your ends meet?
323; ;00:23:46,667 --> 00:23:55,085; ;(Speaker Two) Yeah, you know, especially like, for me, I started out four months behind opening the shop, you know what I mean.
324; ;00:23:55,085 --> 00:23:58,677; ;My construction budget was way over what I expected it to be.
327; ;00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:05,056; ;I was like, "Okay, that's a lot," you know.
328; ;00:24:05,056 --> 00:24:09,690; ;So during the summer obviously, I didn't really drive a lot, we were just so busy and stuff.
329; ;00:24:09,690 --> 00:24:11,528; ;And I had to be around the shop, you know.
330; ;00:24:11,528 --> 00:24:16,204; ;But then like I started driving more once the kids got back into school, you know, and it slowed down a bit, you know.
331; ;00:24:16,204 --> 00:24:20,220; ;So now it's nice because like I can focus on...
332; ;00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:23,818; ;You know, I still do my shop work, you know, and I'm at the shop popping in and out and stuff.
333; ;00:24:23,818 --> 00:24:25,786; ;But it's like now that's like self-sufficient.
325; ;00:23:58,677 --> 00:24:01,046; ;It was my first shop I've ever opened, you know.
334; ;00:24:25,786 --> 00:24:31,690; ;So I get some from that, you know, and it's like decent, you know, but this is like nice icing on the cake, you know.
335; ;00:24:31,690 --> 00:24:35,691; ;So it's like, okay, I got my work bills paid, I got my personal bills paid, you know.
326; ;00:24:01,046 --> 00:24:03,660; ;So it's like, so I'm like, "Oh, man, crap."
336; ;00:24:35,691 --> 00:24:37,162; ;And I still have like a little extra.
337; ;00:24:37,162 --> 00:24:47,404; ;And then now I can drive Uber if I have like, you know, whatever, you know, if I want something crazy or something, I'm like, okay, I'll drive an Uber and then all the proceeds from Uber go to that or something, you know, 'cause I'm a big golfer, you know what I mean.
338; ;00:24:47,404 --> 00:24:54,423; ;So it's like, all right, if I want to go away for a couple days and golf, you know, and like I feel like, not necessarily guilty, but like I just hate...
339; ;00:24:54,423 --> 00:24:58,710; ;You know, I was like I'm trying to like save the work funds, you know, 'cause I want another location, you know.
340; ;00:24:58,710 --> 00:25:06,621; ;So it's like now if I want to like kind of splurge and I'll go away for a couple days, like, okay, I can just go drive for Uber for like the weekend, you know what I mean, and take that and go.
341; ;00:25:06,621 --> 00:25:08,020; ;You know what I mean?
342; ;00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:10,420; ;So it definitely does help with that for sure.
343; ;00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:13,998; ;(Speaker One) Yeah, and so it's in combination with what you earn with your shop?
344; ;00:25:13,998 --> 00:25:15,051; ;(Speaker Two) Exactly. Uh-huh.
345; ;00:25:15,051 --> 00:25:17,161; ;(Speaker One) Are you doing anything else to earn money?
346; ;00:25:17,161 --> 00:25:19,462; ;(Speaker Two) No, just those. I mean like I dabble at like...
347; ;00:25:19,462 --> 00:25:24,103; ;I dabble and stuff, but like I'm starting...
348; ;00:25:24,103 --> 00:25:28,569; ;I just started like a couple online stores recently, more like drop shipping stuff.
349; ;00:25:28,569 --> 00:25:32,495; ;So I'm not really doing like the manufacturing, just kind of like middle manning stuff, you know.
350; ;00:25:32,495 --> 00:25:33,845; ;Do like Shopify and stuff.
351; ;00:25:33,845 --> 00:25:41,635; ;You know, it's super simple stuff, but I just launched those like, one, a week ago, and the other one opens in like another week, you know.
352; ;00:25:41,635 --> 00:25:44,709; ;I'm just trying to get them open for holidays and stuff, you know.
353; ;00:25:44,709 --> 00:25:46,459; ;So I do that stuff in my spare time.
354; ;00:25:46,459 --> 00:25:49,056; ;And there's like other...
355; ;00:25:49,056 --> 00:25:52,607; ;I do like some blogging, a little bit like vlogging stuff, you know.
356; ;00:25:52,607 --> 00:25:55,959; ;But none of those like bring in money.
357; ;00:25:55,959 --> 00:26:00,432; ;That's just like, I just started the shop and then the blogging stuff more for fun and more for like...
358; ;00:26:01,485 --> 00:26:06,033; ;More for documenting like, me opening the shop, you know, and that kind of life, you know, so yeah.
359; ;00:26:06,033 --> 00:26:07,246; ;(Speaker One) You're such an entrepreneur.
360; ;00:26:07,246 --> 00:26:08,291; ;(Speaker Two) Yeah, I just like doing...
361; ;00:26:08,291 --> 00:26:09,744; ;Yeah, I like to stay busy in this...
362; ;00:26:09,744 --> 00:26:11,243; ;(Speaker One) Yeah. (Speaker Two) Yeah, it's hard to sit still, so...
363; ;00:26:11,243 --> 00:26:12,570; ;(Speaker One) Yeah. (Speaker Two) Yeah.
364; ;00:26:15,157 --> 00:26:21,854; ;(Speaker One) I mean, you talked a little bit about like you enjoy meeting new people and that it creates a network for you.
365; ;00:26:21,854 --> 00:26:23,971; ;But other than making money and that part...
366; ;00:26:23,971 --> 00:26:25,038; ;(Speaker Two) Yeah.
367; ;00:26:25,038 --> 00:26:26,168; ;(Speaker One) Does Uber...
369; ;00:26:30,412 --> 00:26:34,125; ;Like anything that it gives you that you wouldn't get if you wouldn't be driving?
370; ;00:26:34,125 --> 00:26:35,910; ;(Speaker Two) So you're saying beside the networking, you're saying, right?
371; ;00:26:35,910 --> 00:26:37,977; ;(Speaker One) Yeah, because you did describe that very clearly.
372; ;00:26:37,977 --> 00:26:41,285; ;(Speaker Two) Yeah, 'cause that was a cool one and just like opened up. That was like...
373; ;00:26:41,285 --> 00:26:42,595; ;Like I a met a lady...
374; ;00:26:42,595 --> 00:26:45,751; ;Just real quick to touch on, I met like a lady that was...
375; ;00:26:45,751 --> 00:26:51,426; ;Like I drove her up here and she, you know...
376; ;00:26:51,426 --> 00:26:53,386; ;We were talking about the shop and then she's like...
368; ;00:26:26,168 --> 00:26:30,412; ;Do you get any other benefits from driving with Uber?
377; ;00:26:53,386 --> 00:26:54,842; ;Oh, no, actually we talked about her stuff first.
378; ;00:26:54,842 --> 00:26:55,900; ;She's like...
379; ;00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:58,470; ;You know, I was just like, you know, asked a couple of questions like, "Oh, you're here for this?"
380; ;00:26:58,470 --> 00:27:05,235; ;You know, yadda yadda, and then she was telling me about a product that her and her business partner were making, it's a...
381; ;00:27:05,235 --> 00:27:07,179; ;Well, basically like a vegan milk.
382; ;00:27:07,179 --> 00:27:11,419; ;You know, it's like a non-dairy milk, you know, but it's more like...
383; ;00:27:11,419 --> 00:27:13,406; ;And it's pretty interesting, you know.
384; ;00:27:13,406 --> 00:27:17,227; ;And I have vegan options at my shop and I have these like non-dairy ice creams I make too, you know.
385; ;00:27:17,227 --> 00:27:18,407; ;So it's like...
386; ;00:27:18,407 --> 00:27:23,150; ;So that kind of stuff can be like invaluable, the networking part, so that was like real big for me, you know, just in general.
387; ;00:27:23,150 --> 00:27:27,437; ;And then also, like I said, the connections in Santa Cruz like that I do...
388; ;00:27:27,437 --> 00:27:32,589; ;You know, like I met a soccer mom and now we sponsor their team and are having a party tomorrow at the shop.
389; ;00:27:32,589 --> 00:27:34,289; ;So that stuff's cool anyway.
390; ;00:27:34,289 --> 00:27:36,657; ;The other stuff would be like I guess...
391; ;00:27:38,050 --> 00:27:40,671; ;I'm trying to think besides that.
392; ;00:27:40,671 --> 00:27:46,113; ;I mean, I know the Bay Area now, that's for sure.
393; ;00:27:46,113 --> 00:27:49,419; ;It definitely helped me learn Santa Cruz and the Bay now, it's like I couldn't...
394; ;00:27:49,419 --> 00:27:51,394; ;The Bay used to just be like a big blur to me.
395; ;00:27:51,394 --> 00:27:54,058; ;I'm just like, "Okay, it's the Bay area, like it's all that," you know.
396; ;00:27:54,058 --> 00:27:55,463; ;And now it's just like...
397; ;00:27:55,463 --> 00:28:00,788; ;Now I can actually like, you know, I just know the cities now, which is pretty cool.
398; ;00:28:00,788 --> 00:28:02,800; ;(Speaker One) Yeah.
399; ;00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:04,724; ;(Speaker Two) And but other than that, that's...
400; ;00:28:06,546 --> 00:28:07,627; ;Yeah, I don't know.
401; ;00:28:07,627 --> 00:28:22,415; ;I mean like there's other stuff that comes like because of, you know, the making the more money and networking stuff just as far as like certain comfort or just like certain feelings that are, you know, like that come off of that that are related, you know, that come off of that.
402; ;00:28:22,415 --> 00:28:25,045; ;But I don't know exactly what else...
403; ;00:28:25,045 --> 00:28:26,603; ;(Speaker One) Can you describe what you mean?
404; ;00:28:26,603 --> 00:28:33,265; ;(Speaker Two) Okay, well, just like the fact that like knowing that I can go make more money if I wanted to or I can go like...
405; ;00:28:34,607 --> 00:28:35,695; ;You know, it's nice to like...
406; ;00:28:35,695 --> 00:28:43,557; ;Say, if I needed like 500 for something next week, you know, like I know for sure I can go out and drive if I want to.
407; ;00:28:43,557 --> 00:28:45,453; ;You know, like I know for certain.
408; ;00:28:45,453 --> 00:28:51,487; ;You know what I mean. It's not like, you know, "Oh, I have to go try to sell some golf balls and hope they sell or..."
409; ;00:28:51,487 --> 00:28:53,956; ;You know what I mean? It's just like I know I can go do it. You know what I mean?
412; ;00:29:05,618 --> 00:29:12,696; ;So that's like kind of just like secondary feeling stuff, which is like, "Okay, cool," just like bottom line or something that's helping, you know what I mean.
413; ;00:29:12,696 --> 00:29:14,433; ;(Speaker One) Yeah, it does.
414; ;00:29:14,433 --> 00:29:19,378; ;(Speaker Two) So there's that comfort that like, you know, a little safety net almost, you know what I mean.
415; ;00:29:19,378 --> 00:29:23,505; ;It's like, okay, just turn on the app and stuff and let's go do some rides and make it happen.
410; ;00:28:53,956 --> 00:28:59,464; ;So that's nice, just kind of like a peace of mind kind of thing, you know, or, you know, I can like...
416; ;00:29:23,505 --> 00:29:25,571; ;So yeah, so that's good.
417; ;00:29:25,571 --> 00:29:28,532; ;(Speaker One) Yeah, so it gives you more of that, like, financial security.
411; ;00:28:59,464 --> 00:29:05,618; ;Or, you know, I can subsidize my trips basically where I go up to Hayward because I can get rides every time, you know what I mean.
418; ;00:29:28,532 --> 00:29:29,598; ;(Speaker Two) Yeah, exactly.
419; ;00:29:29,598 --> 00:29:30,843; ;Yeah, exactly. So that's nice.
420; ;00:29:30,843 --> 00:29:36,790; ;And then also like little benefits, like I don't know if I use them anymore though, but I mean just the stuff that you guys had before like the gas...
421; ;00:29:36,790 --> 00:29:39,757; ;You know, like gas cards or like the Stride Health or whatever.
422; ;00:29:39,757 --> 00:29:43,392; ;There's like a lot of good info for like...
423; ;00:29:43,392 --> 00:29:45,973; ;Just like independent contractor world that kind of...
424; ;00:29:45,973 --> 00:29:48,297; ;You know, that world, you know, I think that's really cool and stuff.
425; ;00:29:48,297 --> 00:29:50,502; ;You guys do a job at performing there.
426; ;00:29:50,502 --> 00:29:54,214; ;And that's good too, yeah.
427; ;00:29:55,462 --> 00:29:56,926; ;(Speaker One) Okay. Yeah, that's helpful.
428; ;00:29:56,926 --> 00:29:57,986; ;(Speaker Two) Yeah.
429; ;00:29:57,986 --> 00:30:02,885; ;(Speaker One) So one of the reasons that we wanted to talk to you is that you had a record when you signed up with Uber.
430; ;00:30:02,885 --> 00:30:05,534; ;And we want to learn what that experience was like.
431; ;00:30:05,534 --> 00:30:06,595; ;(Speaker Two) Okay.
432; ;00:30:06,595 --> 00:30:08,842; ;(Speaker One) And what things are like for you now.
433; ;00:30:08,842 --> 00:30:11,232; ;You have talked a little about your shop and driving with Uber.
434; ;00:30:11,232 --> 00:30:12,291; ;(Speaker Two) Yeah.
435; ;00:30:12,291 --> 00:30:17,020; ;(Speaker One) But we plan to use this feedback to make sure we meet the needs of...
436; ;00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:18,669; ;Meet your needs but also needs of others.
437; ;00:30:18,669 --> 00:30:19,881; ;(Speaker Two) Yeah.
438; ;00:30:19,881 --> 00:30:25,449; ;(Speaker One) So I was wondering how did you know that your history wouldn't keep you from driving with Uber?
439; ;00:30:25,449 --> 00:30:27,756; ;(Speaker Two) Well, you know what, actually, I didn't.
440; ;00:30:27,756 --> 00:30:30,286; ;And then I'm trying to think when I signed...
441; ;00:30:30,286 --> 00:30:31,664; ;I think when I...
442; ;00:30:33,429 --> 00:30:39,240; ;I'm thinking the record was a...
443; ;00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:41,458; ;Well, something that got dropped, you know.
444; ;00:30:41,458 --> 00:30:43,145; ;So I didn't think it would...
445; ;00:30:43,145 --> 00:30:45,780; ;I didn't even know if it came up or not, you know, 'cause I just...
446; ;00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:49,827; ;Because I had also done a...
447; ;00:30:49,827 --> 00:30:52,121; ;Well, before this, I was doing a sales job.
448; ;00:30:52,121 --> 00:30:55,260; ;I was working for this company Young's Market, and it was like a...
449; ;00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:57,465; ;It was a job I was doing before I opened the shop, you know.
450; ;00:30:57,465 --> 00:31:01,335; ;And then they had a strict background test, but nothing came up.
451; ;00:31:01,335 --> 00:31:04,535; ;So I thought it was because it got expunged, you know.
452; ;00:31:04,535 --> 00:31:06,635; ;And then so 'cause it was a misdemeanor.
454; ;00:31:10,901 --> 00:31:12,246; ;So I had to do...
455; ;00:31:12,246 --> 00:31:17,604; ;What I had to do, I had to pay a fine and then I had to...
456; ;00:31:17,604 --> 00:31:20,422; ;I was on like probation for I think a year.
457; ;00:31:20,422 --> 00:31:21,918; ;Oh, no, 18 months, you know.
458; ;00:31:21,918 --> 00:31:23,794; ;So they're like, okay, just don't screw up, you know.
459; ;00:31:23,794 --> 00:31:31,640; ;So maybe I signed up for Uber during that, but honestly I didn't even know I had a record until like...
453; ;00:31:06,635 --> 00:31:09,619; ;Like my old property management job and then so they...
460; ;00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:33,575; ;Oh, I was talking to Emily Wood, you know.
461; ;00:31:33,575 --> 00:31:35,997; ;And then she was like, "Oh, I know it."
462; ;00:31:35,997 --> 00:31:41,506; ;So I talked to Emily on the phone and then my buddy from Sacramento was in town in Santa Cruz and he drives for Uber.
463; ;00:31:41,506 --> 00:31:46,135; ;So when I told what I was doing, he was like, "Oh, if they need someone else, I'm in town and stuff."
464; ;00:31:46,135 --> 00:31:50,659; ;So I asked Emily, I was like, "Hey, if you need someone else, some other feedback, my buddy is here," yadda yadda.
465; ;00:31:50,659 --> 00:31:53,187; ;And she's like, "Oh, no, we're looking for a special criteria," yadda yadda.
466; ;00:31:53,187 --> 00:31:59,856; ;So then when she sent the confirmation email, it was like, "Oh, we're looking for people with records and stuff," you know.
467; ;00:31:59,856 --> 00:32:01,341; ;And then at first I was thinking like...
468; ;00:32:01,341 --> 00:32:08,160; ;'Cause I've got some funny emails before from Uber, you know, like some random background check emails, you know, and they'd send emails saying, "Hey, sorry we sent that.
469; ;00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:09,553; ;That was a mess up."
470; ;00:32:09,553 --> 00:32:13,426; ;So I was wondering if that was like a mess up, you know.
471; ;00:32:13,426 --> 00:32:14,775; ;But then that's all that I can think of.
472; ;00:32:14,775 --> 00:32:16,548; ;(Speaker One) Yeah. (Speaker Two) So okay, that's probably it then.
473; ;00:32:16,548 --> 00:32:20,029; ;(Speaker One) Yeah. (Speaker Two) It's probably like in there.
474; ;00:32:20,029 --> 00:32:23,153; ;So to answer your question, I honestly didn't know, you know.
475; ;00:32:23,153 --> 00:32:24,434; ;I thought it would be more like...
476; ;00:32:24,434 --> 00:32:31,552; ;I figured if it was something like driving related, you know, or something, but to answer your question, I didn't.
477; ;00:32:31,552 --> 00:32:32,719; ;(Speaker One) Yes.
478; ;00:32:32,719 --> 00:32:34,065; ;(Speaker Two) So yeah, since I wasn't like...
479; ;00:32:34,065 --> 00:32:36,326; ;Oh, I spoke then, I was like I had no idea until she sent me the email.
480; ;00:32:36,326 --> 00:32:37,375; ;(Speaker One) Yeah.
481; ;00:32:37,375 --> 00:32:39,439; ;(Speaker Two) Yeah, 'cause once my lawyer...
482; ;00:32:39,439 --> 00:32:45,405; ;'Cause my lawyer sent me a letter once everything was all done, you know, saying like, "Okay, it's no longer...
483; ;00:32:45,405 --> 00:32:47,820; ;It's expunged," and yadda yadda, and this. I'm like...
484; ;00:32:47,820 --> 00:32:51,985; ;It's like now you can say like no on applications and stuff like that, so that was the last of it.
485; ;00:32:51,985 --> 00:32:53,159; ;(Speaker One) Interesting.
486; ;00:32:53,159 --> 00:32:55,887; ;(Speaker Two) Yeah, so... So I'm guessing it was...
487; ;00:32:55,887 --> 00:33:00,923; ;I just signed up before I got up the paper or something before I was expunged I'm guessing, you know, so it still came up.
488; ;00:33:00,923 --> 00:33:07,031; ;(Speaker One) Do you remember whether that indeed happened before you got the letter from your lawyer?
489; ;00:33:07,031 --> 00:33:08,639; ;(Speaker Two) So it would have been in...
490; ;00:33:11,562 --> 00:33:15,637; ;It was in February.
491; ;00:33:15,637 --> 00:33:20,490; ;It was either February or March was when it got...
492; ;00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:27,671; ;Oh, no, that's when I stopped the probation.
493; ;00:33:27,671 --> 00:33:29,167; ;And then...
494; ;00:33:29,167 --> 00:33:35,041; ;But then after that what happens is all the systems aren't updated like right away.
497; ;00:33:45,493 --> 00:33:48,524; ;So maybe it was in that time is what I'm guessing.
498; ;00:33:48,524 --> 00:33:49,564; ;(Speaker One) Yeah.
495; ;00:33:35,041 --> 00:33:40,864; ;So then I had to go back to my lawyer, and he's like, "Oh, you can do it yourself for free or you can pay me to expedite it."
499; ;00:33:49,564 --> 00:33:52,743; ;(Speaker Two) You know, so if I had February, March, and I started driving...
500; ;00:33:52,743 --> 00:33:54,023; ;Yeah, so that would make sense then.
501; ;00:33:54,023 --> 00:33:59,382; ;So it would still be on my record then 'cause I think I started driving with you guys in like mid-March.
496; ;00:33:40,864 --> 00:33:45,493; ;So I paid him to expedite it, you know, so he contacts the whole stuff and gets it refreshed, you know.
502; ;00:33:59,382 --> 00:34:00,602; ;(Speaker One) So it kind of opened up.
503; ;00:34:00,602 --> 00:34:02,602; ;(Speaker Two) So that's probably... Yeah. So that makes sense then, yeah.
504; ;00:34:02,602 --> 00:34:04,959; ;But I just had no idea, I was like, oh.
505; ;00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:08,858; ;Oh, shoot, good to know.
506; ;00:34:08,858 --> 00:34:11,286; ;(Speaker One) Yeah, so when you were applying for...
507; ;00:34:11,286 --> 00:34:12,337; ;(Speaker Two) Applying, yeah.
508; ;00:34:12,337 --> 00:34:13,775; ;(Speaker One) You assumed that it wasn't going to be there.
509; ;00:34:13,775 --> 00:34:16,468; ;(Speaker Two) Yeah, you know, I honestly assumed it then I...
510; ;00:34:16,468 --> 00:34:17,812; ;Yeah, I just kind of assumed.
511; ;00:34:17,812 --> 00:34:23,055; ;And I know like signing up with such like, it wasn't like I thought a long time about it, you know, I was like...
512; ;00:34:23,055 --> 00:34:25,374; ;It was...
513; ;00:34:25,374 --> 00:34:30,033; ;It was like when I first moved to Santa Cruz, I was like, "Oh, my God, it takes forever for Uber and stuff."
514; ;00:34:30,033 --> 00:34:33,648; ;I'm like... And I was like, think I signed up like the next week or something, you know.
515; ;00:34:33,648 --> 00:34:36,118; ;So I was even like...
516; ;00:34:36,118 --> 00:34:45,818; ;And then by that time, like I had already been working at the other job, you know, like the sales job like while I was on my probation.
517; ;00:34:45,818 --> 00:34:46,878; ;(Speaker One) In Santa Cruz or...
518; ;00:34:46,878 --> 00:34:48,336; ;(Speaker Two) In Sacramento.
519; ;00:34:48,336 --> 00:34:49,403; ;(Speaker One) Sacramento, yeah.
520; ;00:34:49,403 --> 00:34:54,012; ;(Speaker Two) You know, so I hadn't even thought about background checks again, you know.
521; ;00:34:54,012 --> 00:34:57,819; ;And I had been working with them for like two years and stuff and like...
522; ;00:34:57,819 --> 00:35:00,142; ;I don't know. So I think it was just kind of out of sight, out of mind.
523; ;00:35:00,142 --> 00:35:01,518; ;(Speaker One) Yeah. (Speaker Two) So I wasn't thinking about it, yeah.
524; ;00:35:01,518 --> 00:35:02,612; ;(Speaker One) Yeah, that's interesting.
525; ;00:35:02,612 --> 00:35:08,508; ;(Speaker Two) Especially if it was like coming on the last year and a half like that, like be good, don't do anything bad.
526; ;00:35:08,508 --> 00:35:10,319; ;I'm fine, I don't do anything.
527; ;00:35:10,319 --> 00:35:11,829; ;I'm pretty good anyway, so...
528; ;00:35:11,829 --> 00:35:13,039; ;But anyway... Yeah.
529; ;00:35:13,039 --> 00:35:18,100; ;(Speaker One) Yeah, when you did that, when you signed up for that other job, did you know that...
530; ;00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:20,449; ;Did they know about your record or did they...
531; ;00:35:20,449 --> 00:35:23,735; ;(Speaker Two) So that job I started pretty much right...
532; ;00:35:23,735 --> 00:35:26,988; ;That job I started pretty much right when...
533; ;00:35:29,633 --> 00:35:33,805; ;Right when I left the other job, so nothing was even on my record at that time, you know, so...
534; ;00:35:33,805 --> 00:35:35,801; ;So it was basically...
535; ;00:35:35,801 --> 00:35:38,937; ;So I was going through the beginning of that when I started my other job.
536; ;00:35:38,937 --> 00:35:42,549; ;And then...
537; ;00:35:44,427 --> 00:35:48,342; ;Yeah, so that wouldn't even have come into play there, yeah.
538; ;00:35:48,342 --> 00:35:53,815; ;(Speaker One) Do you feel like your record has had any impact on your finding employment or...
539; ;00:35:53,815 --> 00:35:56,817; ;(Speaker Two) Well, luckily no because I haven't had to since. You know, like...
540; ;00:35:56,817 --> 00:36:08,011; ;So the other sales job, I went in right after the situation, then also like my ex-wife had worked there and then her uncle was high up and stuff, so like I wasn't like worried as much.
541; ;00:36:08,011 --> 00:36:10,737; ;And then also there wasn't like any...
542; ;00:36:10,737 --> 00:36:18,004; ;Because all the legal stuff happened after I left the company, you know, so like I left for the sales job because I was going back to school, you know.
543; ;00:36:18,004 --> 00:36:27,826; ;So I just got accepted at Sac State and then I was managing an apartment complex from like 9am to 6pm, so I switched with the sales job which was 4am till 1pm so I can go to school.
544; ;00:36:27,826 --> 00:36:28,873; ;(Speaker One) Oh, yeah.
545; ;00:36:28,873 --> 00:36:32,860; ;(Speaker Two) So after I left, it was about like a month later and stuff, stuff started happening and then...
546; ;00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:35,974; ;And so when I applied in the sales job, it was like nothing, you know, so...
547; ;00:36:35,974 --> 00:36:37,063; ;(Speaker One) Yeah.
548; ;00:36:37,063 --> 00:36:38,385; ;(Speaker Two) So it didn't affect me then.
549; ;00:36:38,385 --> 00:36:40,656; ;And then...
550; ;00:36:40,656 --> 00:36:42,244; ;And then after that, it was just...
551; ;00:36:42,244 --> 00:36:43,499; ;It was opening a shop, you know.
552; ;00:36:43,499 --> 00:36:44,777; ;(Speaker One) Yeah. (Speaker Two) Yeah, so...
553; ;00:36:44,777 --> 00:36:45,834; ;(Speaker One) Which is your own.
554; ;00:36:45,834 --> 00:36:47,955; ;(Speaker Two) Yeah, which is mine, so now it's just like... Yeah.
555; ;00:36:47,955 --> 00:36:49,808; ;(Speaker One) Yeah, it makes sense.
556; ;00:36:49,808 --> 00:36:52,709; ;So did you consider other jobs?
557; ;00:36:52,709 --> 00:36:54,019; ;(Speaker Two) I probably did.
558; ;00:36:54,019 --> 00:36:55,890; ;Whatever I considered, I...
559; ;00:36:57,750 --> 00:37:05,383; ;You know, like maybe briefly but not really because of the time stuff, you know, the flexibility, you know, there has just not been...
560; ;00:37:06,475 --> 00:37:08,385; ;There's nothing close. I mean, I can go...
561; ;00:37:08,385 --> 00:37:18,978; ;Like the only job that would be close, you know, which would have still paid well, which would have been like caddying.
562; ;00:37:18,978 --> 00:37:21,773; ;You know, 'cause you get paid good money there, you know.
563; ;00:37:21,773 --> 00:37:26,290; ;But the thing there, it's like, okay, once you start, you're going to be there for four or five hours.
564; ;00:37:26,290 --> 00:37:27,471; ;(Speaker One) That's in a golf course.
565; ;00:37:27,471 --> 00:37:29,453; ;(Speaker Two) Exactly, yes. So you go carry the bags basically.
566; ;00:37:29,453 --> 00:37:33,613; ;You know, so you go carry the bags and most of them you don't walk it, you're on a cart.
567; ;00:37:33,613 --> 00:37:37,308; ;You know, it's just like hanging on the back and just like telling people tips and stuff, you know.
568; ;00:37:37,308 --> 00:37:39,827; ;So that's nice because you'll do that for like...
569; ;00:37:39,827 --> 00:37:45,811; ;You know, you do that for like five hours at like a beautiful golf course and get paid like about $180 usually, you know.
570; ;00:37:45,811 --> 00:37:47,808; ;And because I have some buddies that still it, you know.
571; ;00:37:47,808 --> 00:37:53,974; ;So that's cool, but then you're stuck there for five hours at a time and then you have to go there early in the morning to wait in line to get in.
572; ;00:37:53,974 --> 00:37:56,832; ;You know what I mean? So there's like, you know...
573; ;00:37:56,832 --> 00:38:00,789; ;So that would be like literally the only thing that would come close to just 'cause I love golf and stuff.
574; ;00:38:00,789 --> 00:38:04,345; ;I can go work a couple of days a week and have supplemental whatever, you know, but then...
575; ;00:38:05,943 --> 00:38:12,206; ;But that would have been the only one close, but that wasn't really close to be honest.
576; ;00:38:12,206 --> 00:38:13,436; ;You know what I mean, so...
577; ;00:38:15,523 --> 00:38:17,994; ;I don't know, just the flexibility is like...
578; ;00:38:17,994 --> 00:38:27,423; ;The flexibility and pay, that combination is like really what hits it 'cause like even if I had a flexible job, but they're paying me like 15 an hour, I'm like, "Okay, I can't do that." You know what I mean?
579; ;00:38:27,423 --> 00:38:28,569; ;(Speaker One) Yeah. (Speaker Two) So it's like...
582; ;00:38:34,635 --> 00:38:36,707; ;I'm like, "Okay, then I'll go get a career." You know what I mean.
583; ;00:38:36,707 --> 00:38:38,090; ;(Speaker One) Yeah. (Speaker Two) I'd go back into like corporate...
584; ;00:38:38,090 --> 00:38:44,040; ;You know what I mean? So like the combination is like what hits it for me, you know what I mean.
585; ;00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:45,137; ;(Speaker One) Yeah. Yeah, that makes a lot of sense.
586; ;00:38:45,137 --> 00:38:47,291; ;(Speaker Two) Yeah. I just haven't found anything close.
587; ;00:38:47,291 --> 00:38:49,225; ;(Speaker One) Yeah.
588; ;00:38:49,225 --> 00:38:53,512; ;So you were talking about your probation?
589; ;00:38:53,512 --> 00:38:55,654; ;I don't know, were you're in jail at all or...
580; ;00:38:28,569 --> 00:38:30,150; ;So it just has to work...
581; ;00:38:30,150 --> 00:38:34,635; ;Or if you have a job and that's like, "Okay, you know, I'm going to pay you $50 an hour, but you have to be here from here."
590; ;00:38:55,654 --> 00:38:58,309; ;(Speaker Two) No, no, no, it was like...
591; ;00:38:58,309 --> 00:39:01,310; ;No, basically, to make a long story short, so when I was...
592; ;00:39:01,310 --> 00:39:04,906; ;I used to manage an apartment complex for a couple years in Sacramento.
593; ;00:39:06,239 --> 00:39:13,314; ;So they had 10 properties and most are like Section A, just like rough ones, you know, so they put on those ones 'cause I was the guy there.
594; ;00:39:13,314 --> 00:39:24,537; ;And then... So basically what they did was like me and my boss, who was like the regional manager who's actually the guy that brought me into the business and stuff and we actually have no hard feelings now, you know.
595; ;00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:30,774; ;So when I was going to the apartments, they give me these apartments that are like halfway leased and stuff.
596; ;00:39:30,774 --> 00:39:32,169; ;You know, it's like, really bad, you know.
597; ;00:39:32,169 --> 00:39:36,317; ;So I pump them up to like 90% occupancy all this stuff, you know.
598; ;00:39:36,317 --> 00:39:41,104; ;But I was also like cutting people's late fees and stuff and like hooking people up like that, you know.
599; ;00:39:42,939 --> 00:39:45,595; ;But, you know, I was getting like really good resident retention and stuff.
600; ;00:39:45,595 --> 00:39:48,778; ;But what happened was when I left, they wanted to sell one of their properties.
601; ;00:39:48,778 --> 00:39:57,683; ;And then when they started doing due diligence, all the $100 credits and stuff that I gave back to people, those didn't match up in the books, you know.
602; ;00:39:57,683 --> 00:40:08,387; ;So then he called me, so then basically what happened was my boss, my regional was like getting fired from the owner and stuff 'cause the numbers weren't matching.
603; ;00:40:08,387 --> 00:40:10,776; ;So then he called me one day like a month later or after I left, you know.
604; ;00:40:10,776 --> 00:40:13,634; ;He's like, "Hey, we have a problem. You know, I'm looking through this."
605; ;00:40:13,634 --> 00:40:18,077; ;And then I just told him, I'm like, "Yeah, I was cutting people deals," like, this, that.
606; ;00:40:18,077 --> 00:40:19,705; ;And so we were going over the papers.
607; ;00:40:19,705 --> 00:40:23,814; ;And then I had to, you know, come in, go through the paperwork with him and the accounts, you know.
608; ;00:40:23,814 --> 00:40:27,835; ;And then basically the agreement was that I either pay...
609; ;00:40:27,835 --> 00:40:31,640; ;Well, pretty much like almost all the credits I gave, you know, which was like super stuck.
610; ;00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:40,366; ;So at the end of the day was like, either I can like go to court, you know, and like try to prove that...
611; ;00:40:40,366 --> 00:40:45,162; ;Well, not even prove because I wasn't supposed to give it anyway, you know, it's was just like bad on my end, you know, just like a...
612; ;00:40:45,162 --> 00:40:50,091; ;And I could either do that or they gave me a lump sum that I can pay.
613; ;00:40:50,091 --> 00:40:56,598; ;And then the lump sum means that I didn't go to court and then...
614; ;00:40:56,598 --> 00:41:01,150; ;It was like maybe it's called a plea, like a plea or something, you know.
615; ;00:41:01,150 --> 00:41:02,344; ;So basically, worked out well.
616; ;00:41:02,344 --> 00:41:04,724; ;I paid them a lump sum right off the bat.
617; ;00:41:04,724 --> 00:41:08,034; ;And then like no jail time or anything.
618; ;00:41:08,034 --> 00:41:11,727; ;And then it was I pay them that and then I'm on probation for 18 months.
619; ;00:41:11,727 --> 00:41:17,443; ;And then it might be expunged, you know, 'cause I have no like previous record or anything like that, you know.
620; ;00:41:17,443 --> 00:41:21,567; ;So yeah, no jail time or anything like that.
621; ;00:41:21,567 --> 00:41:24,505; ;You know, it was just like I paid that off and that was it, you know, so yeah.
622; ;00:41:24,505 --> 00:41:29,491; ;(Speaker One) Yeah. So I think the next questions are more about what was it like to be back home again, but that's not relevant for you.
623; ;00:41:29,491 --> 00:41:30,816; ;(Speaker Two) Oh, yeah, I know.
624; ;00:41:30,816 --> 00:41:32,429; ;I remember when you were like...
625; ;00:41:32,429 --> 00:41:35,048; ;Reacclimating into society.
626; ;00:41:35,048 --> 00:41:36,093; ;(Speaker One) Yeah.
627; ;00:41:36,093 --> 00:41:38,161; ;(Speaker Two) I was still there, but... Luckily, yeah, yeah.
628; ;00:41:38,161 --> 00:41:44,520; ;(Speaker One) So are there other ways where your record might impact your life even though you say it's been expunged.
629; ;00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:48,042; ;How has it impacted you during that period maybe or...
630; ;00:41:48,042 --> 00:41:50,844; ;(Speaker Two) Yeah, you know, I think just in general, I think there's still like a...
631; ;00:41:50,844 --> 00:41:55,009; ;Like honestly, I wasn't thinking about it for this one, you know, but still it's just like...
632; ;00:41:55,009 --> 00:41:58,247; ;I know it's like supposedly expunged or whatever, but it's still...
633; ;00:41:58,247 --> 00:42:01,362; ;I don't know when it would pop up or something or like even if it's...
634; ;00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:16,126; ;Even on like a bigger picture scale, it's like, okay, what if I'm doing like this entrepreneur stuff, and then even if I have some type of cloud or something in the future, you know, let's log into this or something, you know, and it's like...
635; ;00:42:16,126 --> 00:42:20,145; ;I don't know, just something that's like kind of there, you know, like in the background, but...
636; ;00:42:22,180 --> 00:42:24,490; ;So I don't know, so it's like...
637; ;00:42:24,490 --> 00:42:28,199; ;I guess, that'll be the weirdest part, just like down the future and stuff 'cause, you know, it's like...
638; ;00:42:28,199 --> 00:42:30,447; ;I don't know. I feel like nothing's like ever hidden now, you know, like something always pops out.
639; ;00:42:30,447 --> 00:42:31,728; ;(Speaker One) Yeah.
640; ;00:42:33,901 --> 00:42:37,071; ;(Speaker Two) But then also like, from my end, like I don't mind talking about it either, you know.
641; ;00:42:37,071 --> 00:42:38,124; ;So it's like something different.
642; ;00:42:38,124 --> 00:42:42,214; ;So some people might do stuff where it's like, okay, I never want to talk about that again or something, you know.
643; ;00:42:42,214 --> 00:42:46,052; ;But with mine, it's like I know I f'ed up and it's like, "Okay, I made a mistake.
644; ;00:42:46,052 --> 00:42:49,757; ;And it's like, you know...
645; ;00:42:49,757 --> 00:42:53,112; ;So it's like I just owned it, it's like it happened and it's like, you know...
646; ;00:42:53,112 --> 00:43:03,407; ;So that's it for that, but like if I didn't have a shop though, you know, like didn't have the shop or if I didn't have Uber, you know, I don't know, I'd definitely be just like kind of nervous.
647; ;00:43:03,407 --> 00:43:05,840; ;You know what I mean, just in general, just like, I don't know...
648; ;00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:06,895; ;(Speaker One) Trying to find a job, you mean.
649; ;00:43:06,895 --> 00:43:08,350; ;(Speaker Two) Yeah, exactly, yeah, for sure.
650; ;00:43:08,350 --> 00:43:09,642; ;I'd be, you know...
651; ;00:43:09,642 --> 00:43:12,421; ;I don't know. That would be kind of like...
652; ;00:43:12,421 --> 00:43:13,981; ;I don't know, that would be kind of crazy.
653; ;00:43:13,981 --> 00:43:16,328; ;(Speaker One) Yeah. (Speaker Two) Just in general, I kind of have that weight over you.
654; ;00:43:16,328 --> 00:43:18,078; ;It's like, yeah...
655; ;00:43:18,078 --> 00:43:28,126; ;'Cause honestly, now that you mentioned it, maybe I did think about it when I signed up for Uber, but like I don't think about it, like maybe at the time, but I don't remember thinking about it, you know.
656; ;00:43:28,126 --> 00:43:30,459; ;So it's like...
657; ;00:43:30,459 --> 00:43:34,518; ;But now that I know that like that came up on there, and I'm just like, "Man, that would be crazy."
658; ;00:43:34,518 --> 00:43:35,773; ;Like what if it...
659; ;00:43:35,773 --> 00:43:40,174; ;I'm just trying to think up like what if you guys were back like, "Oh, sorry, you've got a record and stuff."
660; ;00:43:40,174 --> 00:43:41,234; ;I'm like, "Wait, what?"
661; ;00:43:41,234 --> 00:43:46,569; ;There's something and then didn't get to drive it, there would be like a lot of changes in like the last year or so that I've been driving with you guys, you know.
662; ;00:43:46,569 --> 00:43:47,642; ;(Speaker One) Yeah.
663; ;00:43:47,642 --> 00:43:53,271; ;(Speaker Two) If that was the case, if like you guys rejected it, you know, it would have definitely been a lot different this last year, you know.
664; ;00:43:53,271 --> 00:43:54,921; ;(Speaker One) Yeah. (Speaker Two) Yeah, for sure.
665; ;00:43:54,921 --> 00:44:05,384; ;(Speaker One) So you're saying like although you would be nervous that it might come up sometime in the future, that's kind of scary that it might never go away.
667; ;00:44:07,630 --> 00:44:08,694; ;(Speaker Two) Yeah.
666; ;00:44:05,384 --> 00:44:07,630; ;So far, it has not really impacted your life.
668; ;00:44:08,694 --> 00:44:13,292; ;(Speaker One) I guess you have been able to make your own business and drive with Uber.
669; ;00:44:13,292 --> 00:44:19,599; ;And so are there any other ways that it might have impacted your life?
670; ;00:44:19,599 --> 00:44:21,897; ;(Speaker Two) Well, you know what, just like...
671; ;00:44:21,897 --> 00:44:24,258; ;Not from a personal... Like maybe just from...
672; ;00:44:24,258 --> 00:44:29,989; ;I mean, not from like a business aspect but more so...
673; ;00:44:29,989 --> 00:44:37,179; ;Well, actually kind of business too, you know, because like, okay, I want more locations of this, you know, and I've been like scoping out other locations in Santa Cruz, you know.
674; ;00:44:37,179 --> 00:44:41,844; ;And then I really want to be out there.
675; ;00:44:41,844 --> 00:44:47,403; ;You know, so like my business, we do like a thing where like every item you purchase there, we give a quarter back to charity, you know.
676; ;00:44:47,403 --> 00:44:51,189; ;And it's like we have these bright blue arcade tokens they look like, you know.
677; ;00:44:51,189 --> 00:44:54,689; ;So when you buy stuff, we give you your change or we give you a token for every item, you know.
678; ;00:44:54,689 --> 00:44:55,888; ;And I've got a big...
679; ;00:44:55,888 --> 00:44:59,091; ;I've got a wall like this size where it's split into three.
680; ;00:44:59,091 --> 00:45:03,509; ;And each section has like a donation box and then has a picture collage of that charity, you know.
681; ;00:45:03,509 --> 00:45:08,185; ;So I always have one animal, one children, and one environmental charity, you know.
682; ;00:45:08,185 --> 00:45:17,216; ;So anyway, that's like a big part of my business is that, you know, it's like that's the part that I care the most about and that's why I opened the shop 'cause it's like...
683; ;00:45:17,216 --> 00:45:19,863; ;Otherwise, if it's not special here, I wouldn't have opened it, you know what I mean.
684; ;00:45:19,863 --> 00:45:24,376; ;I'd go, I'd stay in corporate somewhere, do something special, you know, go work somewhere else, you know.
685; ;00:45:24,376 --> 00:45:27,617; ;But I'm like, "Okay, what can I do where I can try and give it back, yadda yadda."
686; ;00:45:27,617 --> 00:45:31,052; ;So that's like my main thing, you know.
687; ;00:45:31,052 --> 00:45:38,387; ;So with that comes like I'm out in the community a lot, you know, and I've been trying to go to Chamber of Commerce meetings, and I'm out at these charities and stuff, you know.
688; ;00:45:38,387 --> 00:45:53,567; ;So like in the back of my mind, you know, part of me would probably think like the higher up I get, you know, like the more out there I am to people, like the more skeletons can come out, you know.
689; ;00:45:53,567 --> 00:45:54,581; ;(Speaker One) Yeah.
690; ;00:45:54,581 --> 00:45:55,876; ;(Speaker Two) So maybe that's one, you know what I mean.
691; ;00:45:55,876 --> 00:46:01,186; ;And luckily, knock on wood, that'll be the skeleton, you know, but I don't know.
692; ;00:46:01,186 --> 00:46:07,685; ;So that does come up like sometimes when I'm thinking of just being out there in society or if I like post a video to YouTube and stuff, you know.
693; ;00:46:10,876 --> 00:46:13,860; ;You know, what if it like just comes back or some of those hackers will be like.
694; ;00:46:13,860 --> 00:46:15,329; ;"Oh, yeah, don't you have a record on here?"
695; ;00:46:15,329 --> 00:46:17,016; ;And I'm like, "What the heck. How did you even find that out?"
696; ;00:46:17,016 --> 00:46:22,002; ;'Cause nowadays it's like, you know, they have your IP address, they can do anything with them, I'm like, "What the heck," you know.
697; ;00:46:22,002 --> 00:46:23,206; ;So that's like...
698; ;00:46:23,206 --> 00:46:25,080; ;That still I'd say would be in the back of my mind.
699; ;00:46:25,080 --> 00:46:35,148; ;I kind of like push it back a lot, but like if I had to talk about something like, you know, one of the negatives from the record would be that, you know.
700; ;00:46:35,148 --> 00:46:36,175; ;(Speaker One) Yeah.
701; ;00:46:36,175 --> 00:46:38,940; ;So even though it's not really impacting your life, it's still in the back of your mind with anything like your job or...
702; ;00:46:38,940 --> 00:46:40,395; ;(Speaker Two) Yeah, it still...
703; ;00:46:40,395 --> 00:46:41,842; ;For sure. Yeah.
704; ;00:46:41,842 --> 00:46:43,910; ;Or even personal life, you meet a girl, right?
705; ;00:46:43,910 --> 00:46:46,113; ;And it's just like, "Okay."
706; ;00:46:46,113 --> 00:46:49,097; ;So my ex-wife, I was going down through it when I was married before, you know.
707; ;00:46:49,097 --> 00:46:52,658; ;So obviously, she knew about it, she was like in there with it, with me, you know.
709; ;00:46:56,865 --> 00:46:57,865; ;You know, it's like...
710; ;00:46:57,865 --> 00:46:58,865; ;(Speaker One) Yeah.
711; ;00:46:58,865 --> 00:47:02,495; ;(Speaker Two) Still like stuff you think about, you know, right now, I'm like just getting back on the dating scene or whatever.
712; ;00:47:02,495 --> 00:47:03,781; ;So it's like...
713; ;00:47:03,781 --> 00:47:05,718; ;You know, something that you just got to learn and stuff, you know, I don't know.
714; ;00:47:05,718 --> 00:47:09,008; ;(Speaker One) Yeah, yeah.
715; ;00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:15,120; ;And that's really understandable, right, that even though it might not necessarily impact your life right now, it's still in back of your mind.
716; ;00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:15,942; ;(Speaker Two) Yeah.
717; ;00:47:15,942 --> 00:47:17,523; ;(Speaker One) Do I tell it? Should I tell it? When should I tell it?
718; ;00:47:17,523 --> 00:47:19,166; ;(Speaker Two) For sure. Yeah.
719; ;00:47:19,166 --> 00:47:20,546; ;You know, what would they think if I do?
720; ;00:47:20,546 --> 00:47:26,636; ;And it's like there's obviously thinking like the first connotations, like, okay, records, "Okay, what did they do?"
721; ;00:47:26,636 --> 00:47:30,622; ;So that's what you don't want obviously, and they're just like, "Okay."
708; ;00:46:52,658 --> 00:46:56,865; ;But if I meet someone new, it's like, okay, it's fine, but then like when you bring it out or when they...
722; ;00:47:30,622 --> 00:47:33,037; ;So maybe hold off on a bit until they get to know you.
723; ;00:47:33,037 --> 00:47:35,015; ;It's like, "Uh," but then it's like, "Oh, yeah."
724; ;00:47:35,015 --> 00:47:36,030; ;You know how it is?
725; ;00:47:36,030 --> 00:47:37,049; ;It's like a tug of war.
726; ;00:47:37,049 --> 00:47:39,061; ;(Speaker One) Yeah. It makes a lot of sense.
727; ;00:47:42,050 --> 00:47:53,685; ;So you kind of already responded to these questions, but I'm curious whether did you ever feel like you were treated poorly because of your record even though, I don't know...
728; ;00:47:53,685 --> 00:47:55,344; ;Well, it sounds like people...
729; ;00:47:55,344 --> 00:47:57,059; ;(Speaker Two) Well, luckily no 'cause it didn't come up.
730; ;00:47:57,059 --> 00:47:59,528; ;Well, I didn't know it came up till this, you know.
731; ;00:47:59,528 --> 00:48:03,151; ;So luckily, I wasn't treated badly by you guys.
732; ;00:48:03,151 --> 00:48:04,861; ;So that's good.
733; ;00:48:04,861 --> 00:48:10,520; ;But in other ways, I'm trying to think.
734; ;00:48:10,520 --> 00:48:12,263; ;I think I feel like...
735; ;00:48:12,263 --> 00:48:13,529; ;I'm trying to think.
736; ;00:48:13,529 --> 00:48:16,440; ;Well, you know what, there was a time.
737; ;00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:25,391; ;So when I was working at the other job, when I was in sales, you know, there was...
738; ;00:48:25,391 --> 00:48:28,689; ;So I was up for a promotion there.
739; ;00:48:28,689 --> 00:48:29,929; ;But that's when I started...
740; ;00:48:29,929 --> 00:48:40,550; ;So basically what happened was I was working the sales job and then my family opened up like a boba tea shop up there in Sacramento and then they had only done franchises before, so they were struggling with like the marketing part.
741; ;00:48:40,550 --> 00:48:42,851; ;And I went to school for business marketing, you know, at the time.
742; ;00:48:42,851 --> 00:48:46,848; ;So I started taking over their shop, you know, slowly and steadily.
743; ;00:48:46,848 --> 00:48:51,412; ;You know, so that kind of got me out of the sales job, you know, when that started doing well.
744; ;00:48:51,412 --> 00:48:54,245; ;And then I could take a salary from there, that's what got me out of the sales job.
745; ;00:48:54,245 --> 00:49:00,723; ;You know, but before I got out, I was up for a promotion there, you know, that I was thinking about taking.
746; ;00:49:00,723 --> 00:49:05,294; ;But it would have moved me to East Bay and stuff and messed up my schooling and stuff, you know.
747; ;00:49:05,294 --> 00:49:15,346; ;But when I was interviewing for it, you know, and then the next interview and stuff, then I started to think in the back of my mind, I was like, "What if they rerun the background and stuff and it pops up and stuff?"
748; ;00:49:15,346 --> 00:49:17,319; ;And I was like...
749; ;00:49:17,319 --> 00:49:25,032; ;But luckily at the time, I could draw a salary from the other place and I kind of waned into there 'cause I like that stuff more anyway.
750; ;00:49:25,032 --> 00:49:26,956; ;It was super hands-on at business marketing.
752; ;00:49:29,609 --> 00:49:33,523; ;But, you know, I was still thinking about it, you know, during the interview stuff.
753; ;00:49:33,523 --> 00:49:36,942; ;And I was like, what if they like have to rerun it and stuff like that and it comes up.
754; ;00:49:36,942 --> 00:49:38,002; ;And then I was thinking...
755; ;00:49:38,002 --> 00:49:47,274; ;Then by that time, you know, it's like a year and a half into there, like I knew a lot of people just because like, you know, my wife worked there, then my wife's uncle was high up there.
756; ;00:49:47,274 --> 00:49:49,136; ;And I was just like a friendly guy, you know.
757; ;00:49:49,136 --> 00:49:50,140; ;So I knew a lot of people.
759; ;00:49:52,151 --> 00:49:55,603; ;I did this like funny skit for the company, you know, that went crazy in the company.
760; ;00:49:55,603 --> 00:49:59,063; ;So it was like, I will be super embarrassed if they rerun it, you know.
751; ;00:49:26,956 --> 00:49:29,609; ;I just had full control, which was nice, you know, so...
761; ;00:49:59,063 --> 00:50:01,013; ;And then it's like, they're like, "Oh, Shaye."
762; ;00:50:01,013 --> 00:50:08,188; ;Then all of a sudden it's like, you know, how stuff just spreads, you know, like one person knows and they tell someone, "Don't tell anybody, you know, Shaye did this and that," you know, so that would have sucked, you know.
758; ;00:49:50,140 --> 00:49:52,151; ;And then I got to do this like...
763; ;00:50:08,188 --> 00:50:09,199; ;(Speaker One) Yeah.
764; ;00:50:09,199 --> 00:50:13,432; ;(Speaker Two) But so yeah, so that stuff, yeah.
765; ;00:50:13,432 --> 00:50:15,978; ;(Speaker One) So it sounds like you didn't experience prejudice.
766; ;00:50:15,978 --> 00:50:17,606; ;(Speaker Two) Luckily, no.
767; ;00:50:17,606 --> 00:50:18,660; ;Yeah, but it was just like in the back of my mind.
768; ;00:50:18,660 --> 00:50:19,667; ;(Speaker One) Yeah.
769; ;00:50:19,667 --> 00:50:20,696; ;(Speaker Two) So basically, yeah.
770; ;00:50:20,696 --> 00:50:25,560; ;(Speaker One) Yeah, so you didn't experience it but you feel like you might have experienced it if people had known.
771; ;00:50:25,560 --> 00:50:26,561; ;(Speaker Two) Yeah, yeah.
772; ;00:50:26,561 --> 00:50:37,991; ;Thank God now I feel just like, you know, for sure 'cause I'm just such a nice guy, so I don't think people like expect it, especially the people that know me, you know, because it's like an outlier for me, it's such a weird thing, you know.
773; ;00:50:37,991 --> 00:50:41,583; ;So like, that would have been like, yeah, bad.
774; ;00:50:41,583 --> 00:50:46,773; ;Especially like her uncle's there and then like that spreads, you know, stuff just catches, you know what I mean.
775; ;00:50:46,773 --> 00:50:51,414; ;And also I was afraid because of the nature it was, you know.
776; ;00:50:51,414 --> 00:50:53,363; ;And it was like messing with like a ledger, you know.
777; ;00:50:53,363 --> 00:50:55,661; ;I was like, "Man, that's like a..."
778; ;00:50:55,661 --> 00:50:57,094; ;You know, it's just like...
779; ;00:50:57,094 --> 00:51:00,893; ;I just felt like I looked bad especially in corporate world, you know, it's just like numbers and stuff.
780; ;00:51:00,893 --> 00:51:04,975; ;It's like, "Oh, man, that would be like the last thing I would want people to think," you know.
781; ;00:51:04,975 --> 00:51:06,125; ;(Speaker One) Yeah.
782; ;00:51:06,125 --> 00:51:07,129; ;(Speaker Two) So yeah.
783; ;00:51:07,129 --> 00:51:08,892; ;(Speaker One) That makes sense, yeah.
784; ;00:51:08,892 --> 00:51:18,206; ;And can you tell me about what role, if any, driving for Uber has played in...
785; ;00:51:18,206 --> 00:51:23,135; ;Well, I guess helping you get settled is not necessarily the right word because you weren't really...
786; ;00:51:23,135 --> 00:51:24,185; ;(Speaker Two) I'm still out there, right?
787; ;00:51:24,185 --> 00:51:27,021; ;(Speaker One) Yeah, but maybe you can still...
788; ;00:51:27,021 --> 00:51:34,357; ;You talked a lot about how it actually helps you meet people, but I'm just wondering if there's anything else that you want to add there?
789; ;00:51:34,357 --> 00:51:35,466; ;(Speaker Two) Just about helping?
790; ;00:51:35,466 --> 00:51:45,002; ;Like just the positive stuff would be like, you know, well, I mean one thing that's nice is just like...
791; ;00:51:45,002 --> 00:51:48,956; ;I mean, obviously, you know, driving for Uber, there's still like that, you know, like that professional barrier.
792; ;00:51:48,956 --> 00:51:56,702; ;But like just seeing people and like getting to know people, you know, like, especially for me, like, you know, act like it's like post of the war, it's just opening a shop, you know.
794; ;00:51:58,121 --> 00:52:00,108; ;It's like, you know, super lonely there, right?
795; ;00:52:00,108 --> 00:52:05,543; ;It's like I don't want to say lives alone, but like very, like a solitary, like, kind of lifestyle, you know what I mean.
796; ;00:52:05,543 --> 00:52:07,995; ;It's like entrepreneur, and it's like...
793; ;00:51:56,702 --> 00:51:58,121; ;It's a very like...
797; ;00:52:07,995 --> 00:52:11,778; ;And it's like I just moved like small town, like smaller town, didn't know people, you know.
798; ;00:52:11,778 --> 00:52:20,426; ;So not even like in effect like meeting people to hang out, but just like, you know, conversing, you know, stuff like, you know, talking to people, then maybe you see them out sometime.
799; ;00:52:20,426 --> 00:52:21,664; ;And like, "Oh, you drove an Uber."
800; ;00:52:21,664 --> 00:52:28,626; ;It's like all that conversation starts, so like that stuff's nice, you know, just as far as like...
801; ;00:52:28,626 --> 00:52:29,707; ;You know, I'll just be around.
802; ;00:52:29,707 --> 00:52:32,034; ;And especially like Santa Cruz...
803; ;00:52:32,034 --> 00:52:39,570; ;Especially Santa Cruz and like when I'll drive someone and it's like, okay, Santa Cruz, black guy in Santa Cruz that owns a boba shop.
804; ;00:52:39,570 --> 00:52:41,434; ;It's like, okay, that's going to stand out a lot, you know what it mean?
805; ;00:52:41,434 --> 00:52:42,453; ;So it's like...
806; ;00:52:42,453 --> 00:52:43,873; ;So many people like come into the shop, you know.
807; ;00:52:43,873 --> 00:52:46,319; ;They're like, "Oh, you drove me, so I came by and stuff."
808; ;00:52:46,319 --> 00:52:51,561; ;So that kind of like, just like a kind of really cool camaraderie kind of thing, you know, where it's like...
809; ;00:52:51,561 --> 00:52:56,939; ;Especially in Santa Cruz where it's such a local, like the whole local presence is very strong there, you know.
810; ;00:52:56,939 --> 00:53:00,537; ;They want to support local and all that stuff, you know.
811; ;00:53:00,537 --> 00:53:04,403; ;So that's been nice just like, you know, just seeing people around, you know what I mean.
812; ;00:53:04,403 --> 00:53:05,892; ;You know, just see you like, "Oh, yeah, I remember you.
813; ;00:53:05,892 --> 00:53:07,679; ;I remember, so and so and stuff."
814; ;00:53:07,679 --> 00:53:10,910; ;It's just like a nice business.
815; ;00:53:10,910 --> 00:53:13,027; ;You know, we're like... I don't know.
816; ;00:53:13,027 --> 00:53:16,664; ;It's like say if I go like Nob Hill all the time, and the same checker or something, you know what they're like?
817; ;00:53:16,664 --> 00:53:18,516; ;(Speaker Two) They're nice, you know what I mean.
818; ;00:53:18,516 --> 00:53:27,771; ;It's nice to be in a place where you're doing, you know, something nice where people appreciate it, you know, rather than it's not like I am going to...
819; ;00:53:27,771 --> 00:53:32,250; ;You know, like my part-time job's not to go collect bills or something like payments from people, you know what I mean?
820; ;00:53:32,250 --> 00:53:33,330; ;(Speaker One) Yeah.
821; ;00:53:33,330 --> 00:53:34,998; ;(Speaker Two) You know, it's nice. You know what I mean?
822; ;00:53:34,998 --> 00:53:36,205; ;Especially late at night.
823; ;00:53:36,205 --> 00:53:40,689; ;Some people are just so thankful, they're like, "Thank you for driving tonight," you know, I don't know, yadda yadda."
824; ;00:53:40,689 --> 00:53:42,755; ;I'm like, "For sure, you know, it's cool."
825; ;00:53:42,755 --> 00:53:45,839; ;You know what I mean, so it's kind of like a good feeling, I don't know.
826; ;00:53:45,839 --> 00:53:47,344; ;(Speaker One) Yeah. That's great, cool.
827; ;00:53:47,344 --> 00:53:48,350; ;(Speaker Two) Yeah.
828; ;00:53:48,350 --> 00:53:54,778; ;(Speaker One) And sometimes people feel like what they do for their job becomes part of who they are.
829; ;00:53:54,778 --> 00:54:01,551; ;Do you feel like that has happened with you with Uber or does it make you feel this way?
830; ;00:54:01,551 --> 00:54:05,232; ;(Speaker Two) Maybe a little bit, you know, but I'm kind of like outgoing anyway.
831; ;00:54:05,232 --> 00:54:11,286; ;But I feel like it's probably helped even more, you know, driving Uber 'cause just as far as like...
832; ;00:54:11,286 --> 00:54:21,692; ;You know, just conversation skills especially like cold, you know what I mean, it's like, you meet a new person, you're just like, you know, I've got like my little playlist for certain people, you know what I mean.
833; ;00:54:21,692 --> 00:54:24,393; ;I've got like, you know, it's just like, you kind of read people.
834; ;00:54:24,393 --> 00:54:25,403; ;(Speaker One) You see the same people?
837; ;00:54:27,403 --> 00:54:28,403; ;(Speaker Two) Well, I see the same people?
835; ;00:54:25,403 --> 00:54:26,403; ;(Speaker Two) Huh?
838; ;00:54:28,403 --> 00:54:30,124; ;Oh, no, I mean like playlist for certain people as far as like why...
839; ;00:54:30,124 --> 00:54:31,124; ;(Speaker One) What type of people.
841; ;00:54:33,010 --> 00:54:36,920; ;And you're not always right, you know, you've got like...
840; ;00:54:31,124 --> 00:54:33,010; ;(Speaker Two) Exactly, right. You're trying to read someone like...
842; ;00:54:36,920 --> 00:54:38,023; ;Okay, you see the name first, right?
836; ;00:54:26,403 --> 00:54:27,403; ;(Speaker One) You see the same people?
843; ;00:54:38,023 --> 00:54:39,050; ;And it's like...
844; ;00:54:39,050 --> 00:54:46,037; ;And I'm not even saying like necessarily prejudice stuff, but it's just like stuff like my mind starts like thinking to set up like a good ride for them and me, you know what I mean.
845; ;00:54:46,037 --> 00:54:50,407; ;So it's like, "Okay, I see a name," start it off, you know, we're going to the area, okay, the person comes out or whatever.
846; ;00:54:50,407 --> 00:54:53,198; ;And, you know, I'm like going through my playlist 'cause I've got like...
847; ;00:54:53,198 --> 00:54:55,723; ;You know, it could be like coffeehouse chill, you know.
848; ;00:54:55,723 --> 00:54:58,567; ;You know, like they're coming out with their suitcase and it's like they're dressed up, you know.
849; ;00:54:58,567 --> 00:55:00,306; ;You know, it's like, "Okay, they're probably going to be doing like paperwork."
850; ;00:55:00,306 --> 00:55:01,754; ;But, you know, like computer work, you know.
851; ;00:55:01,754 --> 00:55:04,965; ;So I'm playing that very non-lyric stuff, you know what I mean.
852; ;00:55:04,965 --> 00:55:05,971; ;You know, like that stuff or...
853; ;00:55:05,971 --> 00:55:06,988; ;(Speaker One) That's so considerate.
854; ;00:55:06,988 --> 00:55:08,001; ;(Speaker Two) Yeah, you know.
855; ;00:55:08,001 --> 00:55:12,176; ;And then we've got like Apple's top playlist or something for the younger kids coming in.
856; ;00:55:12,176 --> 00:55:14,871; ;Okay, cool, here's a centered playlist for you guys or something, you know what I mean.
857; ;00:55:14,871 --> 00:55:17,246; ;It just depends, you know what I mean.
858; ;00:55:17,246 --> 00:55:20,377; ;And I don't know.
859; ;00:55:20,377 --> 00:55:22,796; ;So I just try to like, I don't know.
860; ;00:55:22,796 --> 00:55:27,453; ;So I feel like it's kind of like helped me in like the reading people category 'cause it's so quick, you know.
861; ;00:55:27,453 --> 00:55:36,398; ;It's like you come to pick up, they might be outside at the curb already or you might be waiting at a hotel for like three minutes and stuff, and you're like kind of wondering, you know.
862; ;00:55:36,398 --> 00:55:44,037; ;Or they come in and they don't want to talk at all, that's totally cool, you know what I mean, just how to read people or they're super talky, super chatty, and that's cool too, you know.
863; ;00:55:44,037 --> 00:55:50,863; ;That's allowed me to just kind of like, I don't know, just kind of go with the flow kind of thing, you know what I mean.
864; ;00:55:50,863 --> 00:55:52,644; ;Just different people you would normally meet, you know what I mean.
865; ;00:55:52,644 --> 00:55:53,670; ;(Speaker One) Yeah.
866; ;00:55:53,670 --> 00:55:59,997; ;(Speaker Two) So especially my lifestyle, I meet a lot of customers, you know, but it's like really quick, like, you know, 20, 30 seconds, you know.
867; ;00:55:59,997 --> 00:56:05,205; ;Or if they like stop and like talk to me for a bit about the shop, I get longer, but it's just super quick there.
868; ;00:56:05,205 --> 00:56:07,722; ;It's just like, you've been in the car for 5, 10 minutes and stuff.
869; ;00:56:07,722 --> 00:56:10,644; ;And then it's like, I don't know, I like it.
870; ;00:56:10,644 --> 00:56:11,663; ;(Speaker One) Yeah.
871; ;00:56:11,663 --> 00:56:14,098; ;(Speaker Two) You know what I mean, just kind of navigate, nav stuff, it's cool and challenging.
872; ;00:56:14,098 --> 00:56:15,171; ;(Speaker One) Yeah, yeah.
873; ;00:56:19,800 --> 00:56:28,240; ;And what can you give an example of when you've had a hard time or faced any specific challenges when you were driving for Uber?
874; ;00:56:28,247 --> 00:56:29,269; ;(Speaker Two) In general, right?
875; ;00:56:29,269 --> 00:56:31,620; ;Or not just due to like record or anything or just challenges?
876; ;00:56:31,620 --> 00:56:33,912; ;(Speaker One) Well, both, I mean as...
877; ;00:56:33,912 --> 00:56:42,787; ;(Speaker Two) I know you probably want something like more of that, but it's like I don't have anything that's specific honestly to like a record happening or anything like that to be honest.
879; ;00:56:48,283 --> 00:56:57,164; ;I haven't really had big challenges, you know what I mean, like knock on wood, I haven't had anyone like vomit in my vehicle, you know.
878; ;00:56:42,787 --> 00:56:44,809; ;And then my only...
880; ;00:56:57,164 --> 00:56:58,836; ;They've gotten outside, so that was close.
881; ;00:56:58,836 --> 00:57:07,348; ;But, you know, nothing like that, like nothing big like 'cause honestly the people I drive with have been, you know, real cool, and I don't like...
882; ;00:57:07,348 --> 00:57:10,482; ;And any time there's been a situation, like, I just handle it.
883; ;00:57:10,482 --> 00:57:19,064; ;It's not, you know, there's been like whether it's a guy like too drunk, if he's like being aggressive or being kind of like a jerk, you know what I mean.
884; ;00:57:19,064 --> 00:57:22,102; ;Like, I guess I can handle that without being aggressive.
885; ;00:57:22,102 --> 00:57:27,616; ;You know what I mean, like I know how to tell people to chill out without, you know, escalating the situation.
886; ;00:57:27,616 --> 00:57:29,296; ;That's no problem for me.
887; ;00:57:29,296 --> 00:57:33,062; ;So luckily, that kind of stuff I've had no problem with.
888; ;00:57:33,062 --> 00:57:39,694; ;And if it's sketchy, if I'm going to places like sketchy or if I get bad vibes, I'm just not taking the ride, you know what I mean, I'm just like...
889; ;00:57:39,694 --> 00:57:44,737; ;You know what I'm saying, I'm just like, you know, when I first started driving especially like when I first moved to Santa Cruz.
890; ;00:57:44,737 --> 00:57:49,748; ;And I was up in San Jose because I think it was like when I was first getting like...
891; ;00:57:49,748 --> 00:58:01,264; ;I don't know if I was like getting stickers or something up here, I was like beginning driving and then I got stuck out here late at night, you know, and it's just like a couple of areas that I'm not certain, no, you know, I'm like, sorry, but no, you know what I mean.
892; ;00:58:01,264 --> 00:58:02,284; ;Just 'cause...
893; ;00:58:02,284 --> 00:58:05,739; ;I don't know, if I have a bad feeling or something, like I don't want to do it, you know what I mean.
894; ;00:58:05,739 --> 00:58:10,038; ;And it's like, you know, I had a situation...
895; ;00:58:10,038 --> 00:58:11,095; ;And then that's like...
896; ;00:58:11,095 --> 00:58:17,737; ;And then that depends too 'cause like, okay, that situation was like, okay, couple of guys are coming out of the apartment, you know, they've got beers and stuff in their hands.
897; ;00:58:17,737 --> 00:58:25,168; ;It's like, I don't want to deal with this late, sketchy neighborhood, and have to tell the guys like that they can't bring the beers in, and they go, "Why are you so..."
898; ;00:58:25,168 --> 00:58:28,745; ;You know, 'cause that happens sometimes, people kind of drink liquor, and they're like, "Why man, just be cool."
899; ;00:58:28,745 --> 00:58:32,074; ;You know, like tell that to the cop, you know, tell them to be cool.
900; ;00:58:32,074 --> 00:58:34,532; ;(Speaker One) Yeah.
901; ;00:58:34,532 --> 00:58:41,019; ;(Speaker Two) So that's okay, but then like sometimes, it's like, you know, one time I got, it was over at...
902; ;00:58:41,019 --> 00:58:47,252; ;I was driving back from Sacramento and I had my destination filter on coming back.
903; ;00:58:47,252 --> 00:58:51,363; ;It was late at night and it's over in Oakland, I'm like, "Okay, great."
904; ;00:58:51,363 --> 00:58:55,613; ;And so I'm like debating whether or not I really want to drive over there, you know.
905; ;00:58:55,613 --> 00:58:59,213; ;So I'm like, all right, I'm gonna set destination on and just do it, you know.
906; ;00:58:59,213 --> 00:59:04,185; ;So then I get one and it's like a...
907; ;00:59:04,185 --> 00:59:07,563; ;Well, it was kind of messed up 'cause it was a BART station, like right under a highway, you know.
908; ;00:59:07,563 --> 00:59:08,597; ;So it showed the highway.
909; ;00:59:08,597 --> 00:59:10,478; ;So I drove on the highway I can see.
910; ;00:59:10,478 --> 00:59:14,547; ;And then I called the lady and she's like "Well, I'm at the BART station."
911; ;00:59:14,547 --> 00:59:24,675; ;And I was already like kind of like out the way 'cause the freeway system, you know, but then, you know, she's at the BART station late at night, you know, so I went and got her, you know what I mean?
912; ;00:59:24,675 --> 00:59:35,258; ;So it's like depends, you know, some stuff is kind of sketchy, depends on the area and the passenger, but then sometimes it's like, you know, you feel bad for her too 'cause I got pulled up then and it's like.
913; ;00:59:35,258 --> 00:59:37,794; ;"Oh, my God, what the heck, come here."
914; ;00:59:37,794 --> 00:59:39,971; ;She gets in, she is like, "Oh, thanks for coming."
915; ;00:59:39,971 --> 00:59:41,316; ;I get super sketched out here.
916; ;00:59:41,316 --> 00:59:42,499; ;I'm thinking of something like, "I would too."
917; ;00:59:42,499 --> 00:59:44,516; ;I'm like 6'2" and I'm like, "What the heck?"
918; ;00:59:44,516 --> 00:59:57,955; ;You know, so I mean I wouldn't say those are like bad experiences, just like, I don't know, I just kind of make decisions on the fly, you know what I mean, as far as that, like as far as like my safety, their safety, and stuff like that and whatnot.
919; ;00:59:57,955 --> 01:00:05,142; ;And luckily, I mean the part that I feel good about is unlike, you know, taxis or something, at least you have someone's information in there, you know what I mean.
920; ;01:00:05,142 --> 01:00:08,791; ;So, you know, at least that's a good deterrent.
922; ;01:00:11,953 --> 01:00:16,636; ;But, you know, that's a very good initial deterrent, you know what I mean?
923; ;01:00:16,636 --> 01:00:18,174; ;(Speaker One) Yeah.
924; ;01:00:18,174 --> 01:00:22,989; ;(Speaker Two) So yeah, but not a lot of bad situations at all to be honest, you know.
921; ;01:00:08,791 --> 01:00:11,953; ;You know, it's not perfect 'cause obviously stuff can get stolen and yadda yadda.
925; ;01:00:22,989 --> 01:00:24,302; ;(Speaker One) Yeah.
926; ;01:00:24,302 --> 01:00:27,265; ;And you're describing some of these challenges like with certain locations.
927; ;01:00:27,265 --> 01:00:30,021; ;Do you still have them or has that gotten better because you've worked here?
928; ;01:00:30,021 --> 01:00:31,209; ;(Speaker Two) Oh, that's gotten better.
929; ;01:00:31,209 --> 01:00:32,284; ;Yeah, that's gotten better, you know.
930; ;01:00:32,284 --> 01:00:37,108; ;I've got more experience and stuff and then I'm more, you know, comfortable driving and stuff.
931; ;01:00:37,108 --> 01:00:43,412; ;And even like, you know, when I first started UberPool, that was like a mess for me.
932; ;01:00:43,412 --> 01:00:46,906; ;That was super confusing, coming up here just like...
933; ;01:00:46,906 --> 01:00:48,286; ;Just the ordering system, you know.
934; ;01:00:48,286 --> 01:00:49,504; ;And I was like, "What the heck," you know.
935; ;01:00:49,504 --> 01:00:55,412; ;But that was one of the first, when I first started, you know, 'cause they don't have it in Santa Cruz, you know, so I was kind of like, "What the heck's going on," you know.
936; ;01:00:55,412 --> 01:00:56,888; ;And that was a long time ago.
937; ;01:00:56,888 --> 01:00:59,838; ;And then now pool, it's so easy now.
938; ;01:00:59,838 --> 01:01:07,333; ;And then I like having it add the riders automatically and stuff too because, one, it's more efficient, I don't have to like press stuff.
939; ;01:01:07,333 --> 01:01:16,249; ;And then, two, you know, there would be some situation where people will like order UberPool and they don't want you to pick anyone else up, you know what I mean, 'cause it's cheaper, and I'm like, "My God!"
940; ;01:01:16,249 --> 01:01:17,321; ;You know what I mean?
941; ;01:01:17,321 --> 01:01:18,374; ;(Speaker One) That's not okay, yeah.
942; ;01:01:18,374 --> 01:01:27,157; ;(Speaker Two) So I actually had a situation one time where a lady, you know, tried to get her money back and I drove up to SFO and she was late for her flight 'cause we were on UberPool and I was picking up other people.
943; ;01:01:27,157 --> 01:01:31,513; ;I tried to tell her, but then you guys were good, you guys gave me the money right back and stuff.
944; ;01:01:31,513 --> 01:01:33,150; ;But that was the only situation I had there.
945; ;01:01:33,150 --> 01:01:38,724; ;So otherwise, yeah, I don't know, it's been pretty solid to be honest, you know what I mean.
946; ;01:01:38,724 --> 01:01:50,685; ;And obviously with the new changes fixed a lot of the stuff, the long trip one, you know, told me that, the destination filter, that helps a lot 'cause those were my biggest like grievances because they would cut down the amount I can drive so much.
947; ;01:01:50,685 --> 01:01:55,129; ;You know, because I'd be like the like, "I better not sign on 'cause I don't know, you know, where they're going or whatnot," you know.
948; ;01:01:55,129 --> 01:01:56,173; ;(Speaker One) Yeah, exactly.
949; ;01:01:56,173 --> 01:01:59,153; ;Yeah, that makes a lot of sense.
950; ;01:01:59,153 --> 01:02:11,618; ;And can you think of anything, I mean, you talked a bit about the destination filters, that Uber can do to better support you as a driver.
951; ;01:02:11,618 --> 01:02:13,870; ;For example, how was the signup process, was there anything?
952; ;01:02:13,870 --> 01:02:16,224; ;(Speaker Two) Yeah, you mean the initial signup process?
953; ;01:02:16,224 --> 01:02:24,492; ;I think the initial signup process was solid, I think, yeah, that was fine.
954; ;01:02:24,492 --> 01:02:29,854; ;I have a Jiffy Lube, and that's where I get my stuff checked, you know, down at Santa Cruz, so that goes super fast.
955; ;01:02:29,854 --> 01:02:33,496; ;And well, we don't have to pay anything for that, so that's really good.
956; ;01:02:36,843 --> 01:02:39,800; ;I mean, I've never got the UberEATS bag, but that's not a big deal.
957; ;01:02:39,800 --> 01:02:46,603; ;That was just like randomly I guess, but I was like, I put a couple requests, but I was like, "Okay, whatever, like most of my stuff's pretty short anyway."
958; ;01:02:46,603 --> 01:02:47,672; ;And then...
959; ;01:02:47,672 --> 01:02:48,973; ;(Speaker One) Is it like an insulating bag?
960; ;01:02:48,973 --> 01:02:50,899; ;(Speaker Two) Yeah, it was like some insulation bag, they said, you know.
961; ;01:02:50,899 --> 01:02:52,500; ;But I don't think you guys charged me either, you know.
962; ;01:02:52,500 --> 01:02:55,286; ;They said that they were going to charge me $10, I don't know if they did that or not, I didn't check.
964; ;01:02:58,219 --> 01:03:02,299; ;But as far as making the...
965; ;01:03:02,299 --> 01:03:04,585; ;You're talking about making it easier, right, on our end?
963; ;01:02:55,286 --> 01:02:58,219; ;But if not, no big deal.
966; ;01:03:04,585 --> 01:03:05,909; ;Yeah, you guys have done that.
967; ;01:03:05,909 --> 01:03:12,461; ;Like I don't know about the destination, I wish there was just some way that...
968; ;01:03:14,537 --> 01:03:15,597; ;I don't know how to do it.
969; ;01:03:15,597 --> 01:03:31,363; ;Like I really don't know how to do it, but somewhere to show like where they're going something or like a general area maybe where they're going or even a direction or something 'cause sometimes that just helps a lot like where it just saves time where it's like...
970; ;01:03:31,363 --> 01:03:37,709; ;You know, like I said, if it's like the late night and I don't want to drive, it's like dang, it sucks because I've been driving, you know, 10 minutes to tell them that, you know what I mean.
971; ;01:03:37,709 --> 01:03:41,671; ;And then now they have to wait for another rider, so I don't like that.
972; ;01:03:41,671 --> 01:03:44,383; ;Most of those I will take, you know, like begrudgingly or whatever, you know.
973; ;01:03:44,383 --> 01:03:45,993; ;So I'm like, "Okay, whatever, I'm just gonna do it", you know.
974; ;01:03:45,993 --> 01:03:51,208; ;Especially if like I drove there and it's like, okay, I'd rather drive there and do a bad fare than drive there and get not fare, you know.
975; ;01:03:51,208 --> 01:03:52,716; ;(Speaker One) Yeah. (Speaker Two) It's like, just weight them out.
976; ;01:03:52,716 --> 01:03:57,440; ;So I don't know, if there's like some way just to like get some type of like...
977; ;01:03:57,440 --> 01:04:01,477; ;And I know you guys do that pretty much with the destination filter, you know, so that is good, you know.
978; ;01:04:01,477 --> 01:04:08,113; ;But I use that mainly on like longer rides, you know, 'cause if you were so short, it's hard to get a destination filter right there.
979; ;01:04:08,113 --> 01:04:12,929; ;And then there's so many times where I'm like, you know, I wish there was...
980; ;01:04:12,929 --> 01:04:15,469; ;I'm like, "I wish, I wish," but like...
981; ;01:04:15,469 --> 01:04:25,428; ;'Cause I'm just thinking of this off the hand, you know, but like even if it was like, you know, if you told Uber like I want to go this area or something...
982; ;01:04:25,428 --> 01:04:37,400; ;So for me, for instance, so if I drive from Santa Cruz and then I'd be willing to drive like literally anyone from SFO to like Oakland, like all of that.
983; ;01:04:37,400 --> 01:04:46,475; ;You know, like I don't mind, but I don't know where to put it because sometimes I'm like maybe I should just put SFO, but then it wouldn't get people going up to Oakland also, you know, but I'm totally willing to drive, you know.
984; ;01:04:46,475 --> 01:04:51,333; ;I just want a long trip anywhere up there, you know, so I'm like, I wish we could shade an area, you know.
985; ;01:04:51,333 --> 01:04:52,964; ;I will go anywhere up there, you know what I mean.
986; ;01:04:52,964 --> 01:04:54,340; ;Or I'll be like...
987; ;01:04:56,693 --> 01:05:01,714; ;Or if I do SFO, maybe that won't get trips, well, 'cause I don't know exactly how it works with destinations.
988; ;01:05:01,714 --> 01:05:13,038; ;So I don't if it gets trips to San Jose Airport now, you know, 'cause that would be the most popular request for my area would be the San Jose Airport 'cause that's the closest international airport to Santa Cruz, you know.
989; ;01:05:13,038 --> 01:05:20,153; ;But it's like, okay, if I put destination filter there, what about SFO trips, you know, 'cause I've gotten those from Sana Cruz, you know, so I definitely would want those too.
990; ;01:05:20,153 --> 01:05:24,454; ;Same with Oakland airport, you know, so it's like, I don't know where to put it.
991; ;01:05:24,454 --> 01:05:31,311; ;You know, but then if I put it past that, it's too far, you know, like if I put like Concorde, then that will give me both ways, I don't know.
992; ;01:05:31,311 --> 01:05:32,573; ;So I don't know.
993; ;01:05:35,183 --> 01:05:38,567; ;You know, 'cause I just want to tell you guys, I'm open to all those rides, you know what I mean.
994; ;01:05:38,567 --> 01:05:42,403; ;So but I don't know how to fix...
995; ;01:05:42,403 --> 01:05:43,856; ;I don't know.
996; ;01:05:43,856 --> 01:05:46,439; ;I wouldn't know how to fix it, but it would be nice just like...
997; ;01:05:48,094 --> 01:05:54,732; ;'Cause I doubt you guys would go all the way back to like, you know, showing the actual address before, you know, just for like a lot of reasons.
998; ;01:05:54,732 --> 01:05:57,501; ;And I don't know.
999; ;01:05:57,501 --> 01:06:01,533; ;Or even if you had like a VIP, something like VIP drivers where it's like...
1000; ;01:06:01,533 --> 01:06:06,786; ;You know, 'cause like I keep my rating really high, you know, or as far as at least like the drivers that I know, you know what I mean.
1001; ;01:06:06,786 --> 01:06:09,023; ;It's like 4.95, so it's like I wish there was like a...
1002; ;01:06:09,023 --> 01:06:10,099; ;(Speaker One) That's really high.
1003; ;01:06:10,099 --> 01:06:12,311; ;(Speaker Two) Yeah, you know, and I've done a couple thousand trips, so it's like...
1004; ;01:06:15,210 --> 01:06:18,502; ;So, you know, I almost feel like there'd be...
1005; ;01:06:18,502 --> 01:06:26,275; ;What I've heard, I don't know if you guys like tailor, if you guys filter trips towards like high-rated drivers, I don't know, you know.
1007; ;01:06:31,725 --> 01:06:34,333; ;But it'd almost feel better if like...
1008; ;01:06:34,333 --> 01:06:37,505; ;I don't know, if there was like something to...
1009; ;01:06:37,505 --> 01:06:38,547; ;I don't know.
1010; ;01:06:38,547 --> 01:06:46,729; ;Like I don't know the legalities obviously like what you show certain people and stuff or like if they're an independent contractor, maybe they'll have to be treated the same.
1011; ;01:06:46,729 --> 01:06:54,258; ;But it would be nice if like, you have like a certain rating or something or if you go into like...
1012; ;01:06:54,258 --> 01:06:58,168; ;I don't know, something like Uber VIP driver thing where it gives you like extra little perks, you know.
1006; ;01:06:26,275 --> 01:06:31,725; ;But like just in general, like if there's a couple drivers in there, I don't know if it goes towards the higher rated driver or not.
1013; ;01:06:58,168 --> 01:07:06,098; ;'Cause I know like some part-time drivers, they're like, you know, could care less or whatever about like ratings or whatever as long as their rating's high enough to drive, you know, they're good, you know.
1014; ;01:07:06,098 --> 01:07:07,518; ;But I'm like really not like that, you know.
1015; ;01:07:07,518 --> 01:07:08,777; ;I'm like...
1016; ;01:07:10,779 --> 01:07:14,126; ;You know, 'cause I might present myself too, it's like Uber, but it's also myself, you know what I mean.
1017; ;01:07:14,126 --> 01:07:18,273; ;I'm the Uber driver, but I'm still Shaye, you know, like after I drive Uber.
1018; ;01:07:18,273 --> 01:07:22,157; ;So I always like, you know, try to present myself well.
1019; ;01:07:22,157 --> 01:07:25,962; ;So it would be nice if there was like some kind of like perk for that as far as like...
1020; ;01:07:25,962 --> 01:07:36,957; ;You know, something where like maybe the VIP drivers like wouldn't abuse as much as or like wouldn't cherry pick the rides as much or maybe you could like, you know, see the destination on a few rides or like surge...
1021; ;01:07:36,957 --> 01:07:38,126; ;I don't know. You know what I mean.
1022; ;01:07:38,126 --> 01:07:44,185; ;I don't know the answer for that, but that would really be my like only qualm, you know what I mean.
1023; ;01:07:44,185 --> 01:07:45,258; ;(Speaker One) Yeah.
1024; ;01:07:45,258 --> 01:07:46,305; ;(Speaker Two) Yeah, that's it.
1025; ;01:07:46,305 --> 01:07:48,295; ;Otherwise, you guys have improved a lot of stuff.
1026; ;01:07:48,295 --> 01:07:53,940; ;And I didn't have a lot to complain about in the beginning either, so yeah.
1027; ;01:07:53,940 --> 01:07:57,791; ;(Speaker One) So you also said that you're a really social person and you love talking to people.
1028; ;01:07:57,791 --> 01:07:58,837; ;(Speaker Two) Yeah.
1029; ;01:07:58,837 --> 01:08:02,134; ;(Speaker One) Do you sometimes find it hard to interact with riders?
1030; ;01:08:02,134 --> 01:08:04,000; ;And if so, can you give me an example?
1031; ;01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:08,821; ;(Speaker Two) Um, I don't, to be honest, you know, 'cause I just go off whatever they're giving, you know.
1032; ;01:08:08,821 --> 01:08:10,457; ;So they will usually...
1033; ;01:08:10,457 --> 01:08:15,134; ;Very often they will show me within the first couple of seconds where they're at, you know what I mean.
1034; ;01:08:15,134 --> 01:08:17,751; ;So if they get in and...
1035; ;01:08:17,751 --> 01:08:19,586; ;Yeah, so I just like read that right off the bat.
1036; ;01:08:19,586 --> 01:08:21,367; ;So I really don't have an issue with it at all, you know.
1037; ;01:08:21,367 --> 01:08:25,414; ;And yeah, I haven't had that issue.
1038; ;01:08:25,414 --> 01:08:29,914; ;Yeah, so I'll just see whether they're a talker or not usually, you know.
1039; ;01:08:29,914 --> 01:08:34,803; ;Yeah, and then even when you're talking to people, it's like I'm very...
1040; ;01:08:34,803 --> 01:08:45,094; ;You know, I'm very careful in general in my own life, you know, as far as like just, you know, what I ask people and everything, so...
1041; ;01:08:45,094 --> 01:08:50,938; ;Yeah, you know, so I don't have an issue with that, you know what I mean, 'cause like they have to come upfront like where they work, whatever, like I don't ask.
1042; ;01:08:50,938 --> 01:08:58,482; ;You know, 'cause like, you know, I pick up these people from like meetings and stuff, you know, like from little startups and stuff, you know what I mean.
1043; ;01:08:58,482 --> 01:09:00,313; ;I'm sure like they don't... You know what I mean?
1044; ;01:09:00,313 --> 01:09:05,549; ;Like if they have like a big meeting, some merger meeting or something, "Oh, you work for so and so. Oh, that so cool. What are you doing there?"
1045; ;01:09:05,549 --> 01:09:07,143; ;So you know, like I wouldn't do it. You know what I mean?
1046; ;01:09:07,143 --> 01:09:11,438; ;So it's like, you know, I think if you're incompetent, you know, like...
1047; ;01:09:11,438 --> 01:09:14,172; ;People obviously feel really better than other people, but I just try to...
1048; ;01:09:14,172 --> 01:09:15,395; ;I let them guide it.
1049; ;01:09:15,395 --> 01:09:20,551; ;You know what I mean, 'cause I can go with whatever, I can talk the whole trip, I can be silent the whole trip, I really don't mind, you know what I mean?
1050; ;01:09:20,551 --> 01:09:23,748; ;It's up to you, it's your trip, you're paying for it, so I'll just go with it.
1051; ;01:09:23,748 --> 01:09:25,795; ;So I have personally haven't had that.
1052; ;01:09:25,795 --> 01:09:28,860; ;(Speaker One) Yeah, seems like you're an easygoing guy.
1053; ;01:09:28,860 --> 01:09:30,684; ;(Speaker Two) Yeah, I just let them be.
1054; ;01:09:30,684 --> 01:09:33,448; ;(Speaker One) And we're almost...
1055; ;01:09:33,448 --> 01:09:35,162; ;You've given me lots of information.
1056; ;01:09:35,162 --> 01:09:38,534; ;I'm just curious. You told me a little bit about that you like golfing.
1057; ;01:09:38,534 --> 01:09:40,914; ;What other things do you like to do for fun?
1058; ;01:09:40,914 --> 01:09:50,055; ;(Speaker Two) Golfing is big, sports in general, love watching, playing sports, do like a lot of Rec Sports like around me, you know, for the pick-up games and stuff.
1059; ;01:09:50,055 --> 01:09:51,241; ;(Speaker One) Such as?
1060; ;01:09:51,241 --> 01:09:54,325; ;(Speaker Two) Soccer, so I do Tuesday, Thursday nights are soccer.
1061; ;01:09:54,325 --> 01:09:57,154; ;And then I do basketball on Saturdays and stuff.
1062; ;01:09:57,154 --> 01:09:58,959; ;I just try to stay active like that, you know.
1063; ;01:10:00,747 --> 01:10:02,988; ;So those are the big things.
1064; ;01:10:02,988 --> 01:10:05,821; ;Sports wise, golf's the biggest one, as far as playing, you know.
1065; ;01:10:05,821 --> 01:10:07,659; ;I just love it, just getting out there.
1066; ;01:10:07,659 --> 01:10:11,952; ;And then otherwise it's...
1067; ;01:10:11,952 --> 01:10:14,197; ;Otherwise, a lot of free time is just business stuff.
1068; ;01:10:14,197 --> 01:10:20,698; ;You know, like one of the things that helps driving here, actually another little benefit, but this is only for me, you know.
1069; ;01:10:20,698 --> 01:10:26,583; ;So the reason I started the shop in Santa Cruz is 'cause there's so much boba competition out here in the Bay Area.
1070; ;01:10:26,583 --> 01:10:31,985; ;So I was trying to like go to a smaller pond, try to be a bigger fish there then bring out our brand name here.
1071; ;01:10:31,985 --> 01:10:39,893; ;So when I come here like every single time I come here, I check out at least one boba tea place out here, you know, just for market research and stuff.
1072; ;01:10:39,893 --> 01:10:41,249; ;So I'll just surf the app, you know, go...
1073; ;01:10:41,249 --> 01:10:45,496; ;I don't have the app on, but after a ride, I'll just go do my own thing until I get one, you know, and it's pretty nice.
1074; ;01:10:45,496 --> 01:10:51,720; ;And then it's funny 'cause I do a lot of UberEATS orders from like boba places out here and stuff, so I just like to...
1075; ;01:10:51,720 --> 01:10:54,225; ;You know, I'm always taking notes and pictures when I go in and stuff.
1076; ;01:10:54,225 --> 01:10:55,492; ;(Speaker One) Your own market research.
1077; ;01:10:55,492 --> 01:10:56,633; ;(Speaker Two) Oh, yeah, for sure.
1078; ;01:10:56,633 --> 01:10:58,672; ;Oh, man, yeah.
1079; ;01:10:58,672 --> 01:11:04,765; ;I've got like a huge photo album in my phone, just competitors, you know what I mean.
1080; ;01:11:04,765 --> 01:11:08,796; ;Or I'll order and I'll just record the whole thing, you know, to see like what words they use and...
1081; ;01:11:08,796 --> 01:11:10,160; ;You know, just all that stuff, you know what I mean.
1082; ;01:11:10,160 --> 01:11:14,159; ;It may spark something up like, "Oh, I'll bring that to my employees like say this and that," you know what I mean.
1083; ;01:11:14,159 --> 01:11:18,749; ;So that's like another little added benefit 'cause I get to spend so much time here because of like...
1084; ;01:11:18,749 --> 01:11:21,654; ;Okay, well, if I do want to go out, I'll just go check out some boba place.
1085; ;01:11:21,654 --> 01:11:25,863; ;I can still drive Uber and make some money there and just like offset the cost, so it's not like I sunk...
1086; ;01:11:25,863 --> 01:11:26,894; ;You know, it's like...
1087; ;01:11:26,894 --> 01:11:28,284; ;It just makes sense, you know what I mean.
1088; ;01:11:28,284 --> 01:11:35,441; ;So that's like another little secondary benefit of it too, you know, speaking of that, but...
1089; ;01:11:35,441 --> 01:11:37,857; ;(Speaker One) So that's the main reason you moved down to Santa Cruz?
1090; ;01:11:37,857 --> 01:11:41,102; ;(Speaker Two) Yeah, to open up the shop down there 'cause I wanted to...
1092; ;01:11:46,223 --> 01:11:47,320; ;And then I was like, "Man!"
1093; ;01:11:47,320 --> 01:11:49,858; ;And the shop was doing well there, you know.
1094; ;01:11:49,858 --> 01:11:57,191; ;And I'm like, okay, well, that would be nice to have one, you know, my own 'cause there's little things I wanted to switch, from theirs.
1095; ;01:11:57,191 --> 01:11:59,325; ;And like part of it was a charity thing, you know.
1096; ;01:11:59,325 --> 01:12:05,821; ;And then a couple of other little things like little twists in there, you know, as far as like the quality, the recipes and stuff, and the vegan options.
1091; ;01:11:41,102 --> 01:11:46,223; ;I grew up in Monterey, and then so I was trying to get closer to home, you know, after I graduated Sac State.
1097; ;01:12:05,821 --> 01:12:17,781; ;So yeah, anyway, I lived all down the coast and stuff, loved Santa Cruz, Capitola, and specifically Capitola Beach, you know, I've got an awesome location down there and just ran with it, yeah.
1098; ;01:12:17,781 --> 01:12:19,428; ;(Speaker One) What's the name of your store?
1099; ;01:12:19,428 --> 01:12:21,169; ;(Speaker Two) It's called Off The Block. (Speaker One) Off The Block, okay.
1100; ;01:12:21,169 --> 01:12:24,689; ;(Speaker Two) Yeah, so we have these like cylinders of ice cream and we shave it.
1101; ;01:12:24,689 --> 01:12:30,484; ;So we have like a block of ice cream, you know, we shave it into the cup and then you choose your toppings after that, so it's cool.
1102; ;01:12:30,484 --> 01:12:32,084; ;Also, let me show you one picture.
1103; ;01:12:32,084 --> 01:12:33,569; ;This is my own little...
1104; ;01:12:33,569 --> 01:12:37,454; ;Then it's hard to like explain to people when they haven't seen it.
1105; ;01:12:37,454 --> 01:12:38,645; ;So I'll just show you a quick one.
1106; ;01:12:38,645 --> 01:12:39,697; ;So it's...
1107; ;01:12:45,027 --> 01:12:47,372; ;Or not cool, I'm shy.
1108; ;01:12:47,372 --> 01:12:55,429; ;Okay, yeah, so it's like, we shave it into a cup, you know, then choose your toppings on top, you know, so it comes out like super wavy.
1109; ;01:12:55,429 --> 01:12:59,200; ;So we play on like the beach waves and stuff and like...
1110; ;01:12:59,200 --> 01:13:04,259; ;I guess it's just not working right now, but anyway, we put on the waves and stuff, so that's why I picked that area and stuff.
1111; ;01:13:04,259 --> 01:13:06,458; ;(Speaker One) Yeah, that's really cool.
1112; ;01:13:06,458 --> 01:13:12,530; ;Is there anything else that I didn't ask or that you want to tell me or anything that you want to share?
1113; ;01:13:12,530 --> 01:13:20,236; ;(Speaker Two) No, I think I got it all out there.
1114; ;01:13:20,236 --> 01:13:22,661; ;Well, there was something about cancellation or something, there's...
1115; ;01:13:25,119 --> 01:13:26,527; ;What was it?
1116; ;01:13:26,527 --> 01:13:29,239; ;No, I think... Oh, no. Oh, I like the timer.
1117; ;01:13:29,239 --> 01:13:33,335; ;The timer, you guys have the timer now and stuff for cancellation and stuff, that's really good too.
1118; ;01:13:33,335 --> 01:13:36,203; ;And then also that it charges them after the two minutes, that's cool too, you know.
1119; ;01:13:36,203 --> 01:13:39,939; ;So that's just good stuff, yeah, but nothing...
1120; ;01:13:39,939 --> 01:13:41,903; ;Like I said, everything else, yeah.
1121; ;01:13:41,903 --> 01:13:43,310; ;(Speaker One) Great.

1; ;00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,500; ;This concludes the advanced storage features for file training.
2; ;00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:09,200; ;We covered the configuration of NAS servers to support multi-tenant environments;
3; ;00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:15,630; ;The creation of additional static routes and enabling the IP Packet reflect feature;
4; ;00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:21,660; ;The UFS 64 file systems capacity extension and shrink capabilities;
5; ;00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:27,000; ;The use of user entry quotas to control file storage utilization;
6; ;00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,000; ;And the compression of file data to enhance storage capacity efficiency.
7; ;00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,960; ;From a design perspective; the multi-tenancy and advance in static routing.
8; ;00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:46,800; ;The IP packet reflect features provide greater networking flexibility, thus adding into system network capacity.
9; ;00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:58,300; ;The UFS 64 file system extension and shrink feature provides additional storage flexibility, that will affect system storage capacity designs.
10; ;00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:07,360; ;The quotas feature also will affect storage capacity designs, with its ability to define space limitations on filed data.
11; ;00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:19,360; ;And finally, unit compression on file source resources provides a mechanism to use existing storage space more efficiently therefore affecting storage capacity designs.
12; ;00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,960; ;So what's next?
13; ;00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:27,660; ;If you plan on taking the certification exam, you should take each one of the trainings provided in the learning center.
14; ;00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:35,000; ;And also please, remember to download all the student resource guides for a full set of study materials.
15; ;00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,860; ;The learning center provides access to a practice exam to further help you prepare.
16; ;00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:42,860; ;Thanks for taking the training, and good luck.
1; ;00:00:00,068 --> 00:00:01,708; ;(Speaker One) We want to hear if that's a case so...
2; ;00:00:01,708 --> 00:00:02,714; ;(Speaker Two) Yeah.
3; ;00:00:02,714 --> 00:00:07,875; ;(Speaker One) Feel free to say anything you want like I said before, if you don't want to answer any questions...
4; ;00:00:07,875 --> 00:00:08,894; ;(Speaker Two) No, that's fine. Go ahead.
5; ;00:00:08,894 --> 00:00:09,921; ;(Speaker One) Then that's fine too.
6; ;00:00:09,921 --> 00:00:10,943; ;(Speaker Two) Yup.
7; ;00:00:10,943 --> 00:00:13,268; ;(Speaker One) And if you're frustrated, you can tell me everything as well.
8; ;00:00:13,268 --> 00:00:14,658; ;(Speaker Two) Okay.
9; ;00:00:14,658 --> 00:00:20,504; ;(Speaker One) So let me just get my questions, but we can start with the stuff that what's frustrating you.
10; ;00:00:20,504 --> 00:00:22,831; ;(Speaker Two) No, it's okay. Let's start with your questions.
11; ;00:00:22,831 --> 00:00:36,695; ;(Speaker One) Well, it's kind of related because I would love to start and hear from you how it was to start off as driving with Uber and also what you thought of signing up with Uber because clearly that was frustrating for you.
12; ;00:00:36,695 --> 00:00:37,716; ;(Speaker Two) Right.
13; ;00:00:37,716 --> 00:00:41,911; ;(Speaker One) So why did you start driving with Uber and what was it like to start driving with Uber?
14; ;00:00:41,911 --> 00:00:48,188; ;(Speaker Two) So actually, both my husband and I started to drive for Uber for just some additional money.
15; ;00:00:48,188 --> 00:00:53,818; ;Both of us have, I would say, regular full-time jobs during the week.
16; ;00:00:53,818 --> 00:01:00,630; ;So we both made the decision to drive for Uber just to pick up some additional cash.
17; ;00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:07,038; ;When I signed up for Uber, it took about six weeks for me to get cleared to drive.
18; ;00:01:07,038 --> 00:01:14,973; ;It was quite a hassle, don't understand and wasn't able to get transparency into the background check process.
19; ;00:01:14,973 --> 00:01:17,558; ;(Speaker One) Did they say it was because of the background check process?
20; ;00:01:17,558 --> 00:01:18,770; ;(Speaker Two) Yes.
21; ;00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:31,944; ;And for as sophisticated and complex is Uber's background check process is supposed to be, it's not nearly to the level of sophistication as working at a financial institution...
22; ;00:01:31,944 --> 00:01:32,968; ;(Speaker One) Right.
23; ;00:01:32,968 --> 00:01:42,395; ;(Speaker Two) Where you have to be fingerprinted and run through federal databases which I am for my regular full-time job, I mean, and that took four days.
24; ;00:01:42,395 --> 00:01:43,410; ;(Speaker One) Yeah.
25; ;00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:58,385; ;(Speaker Two) So I think there are or at least my perception is that there is an issue or a challenge in the background check process in terms of if something comes up, nobody made an effort to reach out to me to verify.
26; ;00:02:00,282 --> 00:02:14,746; ;I think actually and I would be there curious to see my background report that was generated because I was born in South Carolina and they searched me under my maiden name which is Schmitt.
27; ;00:02:14,746 --> 00:02:18,634; ;But they searched me in South Carolina as Amy Johnson.
28; ;00:02:18,634 --> 00:02:26,230; ;And I truly do believe that's something was and I lived there until I was five.
29; ;00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:35,728; ;And I truly believe that erroneous information was picked up in whatever Uber's background check process was...
30; ;00:02:35,728 --> 00:02:36,732; ;(Speaker One) Yeah.
31; ;00:02:36,732 --> 00:02:43,780; ;(Speaker Two) Because any issue that I may have had would have been non-discoverable to Uber under California State Law.
32; ;00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:45,216; ;(Speaker One) Right.
33; ;00:02:45,216 --> 00:02:49,161; ;So you think that they have might found records for someone else?
34; ;00:02:49,161 --> 00:02:50,171; ;(Speaker Two) Exactly.
35; ;00:02:50,171 --> 00:02:53,725; ;(Speaker One) Yeah. Yeah, so I don't have your background check here.
36; ;00:02:53,725 --> 00:02:55,393; ;(Speaker Two) For sure.
37; ;00:02:55,393 --> 00:03:01,283; ;(Speaker One) And so I don't know specific things that we found for you.
38; ;00:03:01,283 --> 00:03:07,918; ;I will go and talk to our lawyers and see whether or not like we can share anything with you because I think this is pretty serious.
39; ;00:03:07,918 --> 00:03:08,925; ;(Speaker Two) It is serious.
40; ;00:03:08,925 --> 00:03:10,052; ;(Speaker One) Yeah.
41; ;00:03:10,052 --> 00:03:14,011; ;And like I said, I'm happy that we got you on like regard...
42; ;00:03:14,011 --> 00:03:15,035; ;(Speaker Two) For sure.
43; ;00:03:15,035 --> 00:03:20,344; ;(Speaker One) It's frustrating that it took six weeks, it would have been more annoying if they would have...
44; ;00:03:20,344 --> 00:03:24,253; ;If you wouldn't have been accepted, right, because of something someone else did.
45; ;00:03:25,438 --> 00:03:34,787; ;(Speaker Two) And I think like my over-arching feedback, kind of, I understand the purpose of the interviews and the study that is being done.
46; ;00:03:34,787 --> 00:03:50,006; ;And my over-arching feedback is, you know, reintegration, you know, for someone who is a more serious offender versus someone who has a minor incident on their record.
47; ;00:03:50,006 --> 00:04:02,268; ;I think the number one thing if you really want to help give people as a second or a third whatever chance is to meet the onboarding process as simple and seamless as possible.
48; ;00:04:02,268 --> 00:04:03,290; ;(Speaker One) Yeah.
49; ;00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:06,643; ;(Speaker Two) And to perhaps have some sort of...
50; ;00:04:08,029 --> 00:04:13,406; ;I mean, correct me if I am wrong, I believe the background check process is outsourced to a third party.
51; ;00:04:13,406 --> 00:04:14,426; ;(Speaker One) Yup.
52; ;00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:26,969; ;(Speaker Two) You know, perhaps some real evaluation of whether or not that third party is appropriate to be doing that work and is best in class to be doing that work.
53; ;00:04:26,969 --> 00:04:40,368; ;Some thought about whether there needs to be some sort of internal review for folks that pop up whether it's a misdemeanor or a felony whatever it is on their record internally...
54; ;00:04:42,246 --> 00:04:51,750; ;Because if I was someone who was looking to reintegrate into society and I thought Uber was a viable way, there's no way I would have been able to wait six weeks.
55; ;00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:52,924; ;(Speaker One) Yeah, that's a good point.
56; ;00:04:52,924 --> 00:04:58,287; ;(Speaker Two) I had the luxury of waiting 'cause this was not my full-time job.
57; ;00:04:58,287 --> 00:04:59,338; ;(Speaker One) Yeah.
58; ;00:04:59,338 --> 00:05:00,992; ;(Speaker Two) It was something I was looking to do as extra...
59; ;00:05:00,992 --> 00:05:02,759; ;(Speaker One) Yeah.
60; ;00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:03,762; ;And so there was...
61; ;00:05:03,762 --> 00:05:07,796; ;You said that there was no transparency, did they say anything, "We are still running your background check or...
62; ;00:05:07,796 --> 00:05:10,664; ;(Speaker Two) Yes because I would email and...
63; ;00:05:10,664 --> 00:05:11,694; ;(Speaker One) Yeah.
64; ;00:05:11,694 --> 00:05:14,231; ;(Speaker Two) Asking what is the delay, what is the delay?
65; ;00:05:14,231 --> 00:05:16,254; ;And of course, there's no one you can speak to.
66; ;00:05:16,254 --> 00:05:17,465; ;(Speaker One) Yeah.
67; ;00:05:17,465 --> 00:05:30,033; ;(Speaker Two) You can't get a live person, you go through our website, you submit, you know, everyone wants to lower costs so everything is done electronically, you can't get a real person to help you or talk to you through the process.
68; ;00:05:31,828 --> 00:05:51,215; ;And again, if Uber really is committed to making this aim more workable solution for drivers or for people who want to drive for Uber as a way to reintegrate, you've got to make it easier and more user-friendly and there has to be someone, I guess, you have to make it more personal.
69; ;00:05:51,215 --> 00:05:52,526; ;(Speaker One) Yeah.
70; ;00:05:52,526 --> 00:05:58,005; ;(Speaker Two) To sort of help folks sharpen them through the process of becoming a driver.
71; ;00:05:58,005 --> 00:06:12,310; ;(Speaker One) Yeah. So you're saying it was not just a delay which is a huge financial burden for someone who wouldn't have a job, but it's also the fact that it wasn't personal enough because you couldn't speak to a person and you had to email constantly.
72; ;00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:22,211; ;(Speaker Two) I had to email, I didn't get a response and it's not even just email, you go to the third party background check website, you submit your request and it goes off into the ether.
73; ;00:06:22,211 --> 00:06:23,219; ;(Speaker One) Yeah.
74; ;00:06:23,219 --> 00:06:25,174; ;(Speaker Two) And you may or may not get a response.
75; ;00:06:25,174 --> 00:06:26,196; ;(Speaker One) Yeah.
76; ;00:06:26,196 --> 00:06:27,212; ;Did you...
77; ;00:06:27,212 --> 00:06:28,969; ;Have you ever been to Greenlight Hub?
78; ;00:06:31,764 --> 00:06:36,290; ;(Speaker Two) Is the Greenlight Hub the same sort of locations where you sign up?
79; ;00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:37,428; ;(Speaker One) Yes.
80; ;00:06:37,428 --> 00:06:50,754; ;(Speaker Two) So yes, I have, twice, but I never would have thought because the Greenlight Hub isn't necessarily advertised as a place to solve problems for onboarding to Uber.
81; ;00:06:50,754 --> 00:06:52,358; ;(Speaker One) This is very good feedback.
82; ;00:06:52,358 --> 00:07:04,626; ;(Speaker Two) Yeah, I never would have thought, like even if I had an issue driving, just period, my first thought or my first instinct would not be to go to the Greenlight Hub.
83; ;00:07:04,626 --> 00:07:08,101; ;(Speaker One) And why would you not go there or why would you go to...?
84; ;00:07:08,101 --> 00:07:18,730; ;(Speaker Two) One, they are not convenient, two, I have no idea of what their hours of operation are, I mean, it's not like it's something that's very present in my consciousness that this is an available resource to me.
85; ;00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:19,798; ;(Speaker One) Yeah.
86; ;00:07:19,798 --> 00:07:24,930; ;(Speaker Two) And three, I have zero understanding of what the Greenlight Hub can actually do for me.
87; ;00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:27,078; ;(Speaker One) This is very good feedback.
88; ;00:07:27,078 --> 00:07:32,535; ;And you're saying that they are not convenient is that because you don't know the hours or is the location not convenient, is there anything else that's...
89; ;00:07:32,535 --> 00:07:33,749; ;(Speaker Two) The location is not convenient.
90; ;00:07:33,749 --> 00:07:34,760; ;(Speaker One) Okay.
91; ;00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:40,300; ;(Speaker Two) I know that there is one like, you know, I primarily drive in the North Bay, there's nothing in the North Bay for Uber.
92; ;00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:41,332; ;(Speaker One) Yeah.
93; ;00:07:41,332 --> 00:07:43,645; ;(Speaker Two) There is no support up in the North Bay.
94; ;00:07:43,645 --> 00:07:50,041; ;You either have to drive all the way in to San Francisco or all the way over into Oakland.
95; ;00:07:50,041 --> 00:07:51,044; ;(Speaker One) Yeah.
96; ;00:07:51,044 --> 00:07:52,535; ;(Speaker Two) It's not convenient.
97; ;00:07:52,535 --> 00:07:57,952; ;(Speaker One) Yeah, now this is important because if you don't feel like you can go somewhere then...
98; ;00:07:57,952 --> 00:07:59,400; ;(Speaker Two) Feel like there is no place to go.
99; ;00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:05,158; ;The only place you can go is through the app to the customer service feature.
100; ;00:08:05,158 --> 00:08:06,181; ;(Speaker One) Yeah.
101; ;00:08:06,181 --> 00:08:19,513; ;(Speaker Two) And, you know, you may or may not get someone in India, who is trying to interpret and doing the best that they can, but for something like what we're discussing are not equipped.
102; ;00:08:19,513 --> 00:08:20,532; ;They...
103; ;00:08:20,532 --> 00:08:28,415; ;Someone who is having an onboarding challenge needs to be able to pick up the phone and call a helpdesk that sits within HR.
104; ;00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:34,474; ;(Speaker One) Yeah, and did you ever use in-app customer service?
105; ;00:08:34,474 --> 00:08:42,344; ;(Speaker Two) I would never have used the in-app customer service for what I consider to be an HR and onboarding issue.
106; ;00:08:42,344 --> 00:08:43,458; ;(Speaker One) Right.
107; ;00:08:43,458 --> 00:08:44,470; ;(Speaker Two) At least I should have legal protections...
108; ;00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:45,475; ;(Speaker One) Yeah.
109; ;00:08:45,475 --> 00:08:52,087; ;(Speaker Two) And I should be able to be speaking with someone who understands what the legal implications are.
110; ;00:08:52,087 --> 00:08:54,090; ;(Speaker One) So it sounds like you felt like you didn't know where to go and tell.
111; ;00:08:54,090 --> 00:08:58,708; ;(Speaker Two) I had a zero place to go and all I could do is wait and be frustrated.
112; ;00:08:58,708 --> 00:09:04,191; ;(Speaker One) Yeah, how quickly was your husband onboarded?
113; ;00:09:04,191 --> 00:09:05,208; ;(Speaker Two) About two weeks.
114; ;00:09:05,208 --> 00:09:06,225; ;(Speaker One) Okay.
115; ;00:09:06,225 --> 00:09:07,225; ;(Speaker Two) Yeah.
116; ;00:09:07,225 --> 00:09:08,728; ;(Speaker One) Yeah, that was also big gap to seal it I guess.
117; ;00:09:08,728 --> 00:09:28,124; ;(Speaker Two) Yeah, so it didn't make sense to me why it would take six weeks to onboard me, especially when I'm in my full-time job I go through the most extreme type of background check.
118; ;00:09:28,124 --> 00:09:31,113; ;(Speaker One) Yeah, yeah. When was this?
119; ;00:09:31,113 --> 00:09:32,949; ;When did you sign up and when you were onboard?
120; ;00:09:32,949 --> 00:09:33,962; ;(Speaker Two) About a year ago.
121; ;00:09:33,962 --> 00:09:34,979; ;(Speaker One) Okay.
122; ;00:09:34,979 --> 00:09:35,999; ;(Speaker Two) Yeah.
123; ;00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:44,339; ;(Speaker One) This is super helpful and I totally agree that it should be easy and it should be personal and I am really sorry that you had this experience because that, yeah, that must have been frustrating.
124; ;00:09:44,339 --> 00:09:46,219; ;(Speaker Two) Not your fault. Very frustrating.
125; ;00:09:46,219 --> 00:09:59,918; ;(Speaker One) Yeah, and even though it's not my fault I'm still apologizing and through this way, I'm super graceful that you are here today because we need this feedback to improve this because if everyone has this experience, that's a terrible experience, right?
126; ;00:09:59,918 --> 00:10:13,949; ;(Speaker Two) You know, one of the things and the most, you know, when people give me a hard time because I drive for Uber, you know, and there is a lot of negative view of Uber.
127; ;00:10:13,949 --> 00:10:24,929; ;One of the things that I talk about that I'm very proud of about Uber is the places where Uber creates opportunities for those who might be disenfranchised.
128; ;00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:29,880; ;You know, I love the fact that Uber is a thing for people in the deaf community.
129; ;00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:41,540; ;I love the fact that folks who may not be able to work at 9 to 5 because they have an illness or whatever it is, you get in their car and drive and have agency.
130; ;00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:53,300; ;I love the fact that folks who may have had an issue at some point of time in their lives can find a way back into productive work through Uber.
131; ;00:10:53,300 --> 00:11:00,680; ;And so those were the stories that I tell and these are the things that I talk about when my riders ask me, "Well, why do you drive for Uber?
132; ;00:11:00,689 --> 00:11:01,866; ;It's such a shit company."
133; ;00:11:01,866 --> 00:11:02,883; ;(Speaker One) Oh, your riders say that?
134; ;00:11:02,883 --> 00:11:03,891; ;(Speaker Two) Yes.
135; ;00:11:03,891 --> 00:11:05,068; ;(Speaker One) Even though they take Uber?
136; ;00:11:05,068 --> 00:11:17,156; ;(Speaker Two) Yes, yes, I mean, because obviously, the convenience of Uber seems to trump folks' perception of the company and the culture.
137; ;00:11:17,156 --> 00:11:18,413; ;(Speaker One) Yeah.
138; ;00:11:18,413 --> 00:11:27,217; ;So when you say when people talk to you about how negative they feel were just riders or other people as well maybe? You know...
139; ;00:11:27,217 --> 00:11:29,480; ;(Speaker Two) Riders. And riders want to talk about Uber.
140; ;00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,511; ;(Speak One) Oh, yeah.
141; ;00:11:30,511 --> 00:11:32,974; ;(Speaker Two) They want to talk about Uber.
142; ;00:11:32,974 --> 00:11:43,824; ;And I think the number one thing like I personally would suggest to folks is I think every single Uber employee that sits in the corporate office needs to be a driver for at least a month.
143; ;00:11:43,824 --> 00:11:44,861; ;(Speaker One) Yeah, to get that experience.
144; ;00:11:44,861 --> 00:11:58,772; ;(Speaker Two) He needs to actually go out and do it and see how difficult it is because it's not, I mean, and I thought in my misconception was when I started "Oh, this would be easy, I'm just gonna get my car and when I drive around and it's totally gonna be fine."
145; ;00:11:58,772 --> 00:12:00,720; ;It's not as easy as that.
146; ;00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:07,962; ;I mean, I do a very complex regulatory financial institution work during the day.
147; ;00:12:07,962 --> 00:12:08,993; ;(Speaker One) Yeah.
148; ;00:12:08,993 --> 00:12:14,835; ;(Speaker Two) And I'm not saying that driving for Uber is at that level but it's not a walk in the park.
149; ;00:12:14,835 --> 00:12:26,479; ;And I think there would be a lot more understanding and a lot more compassion if more folks who worked in the corporate office actually did it and committed to doing it.
150; ;00:12:26,479 --> 00:12:34,540; ;For a good 30 hours a week for a month to really understand and appreciate the driver perspective.
151; ;00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:40,071; ;(Speaker One) And what would you say is the most challenging or why is it so hard to be an Uber driver?
152; ;00:12:40,071 --> 00:12:49,232; ;(Speaker Two) Because you're dealing with a lot of different people and a lot of energy that comes through your car and having to manage at all those different levels...
153; ;00:12:49,232 --> 00:12:53,048; ;So for example, in your day-to-day interactions you get to choose.
154; ;00:12:53,048 --> 00:12:54,053; ;(Speaker One) Yup.
155; ;00:12:54,053 --> 00:12:55,061; ;(Speaker Two) For the most part...
156; ;00:12:55,061 --> 00:12:56,081; ;(Speaker One) Who do you hang out with you mean.
157; ;00:12:56,081 --> 00:12:58,548; ;(Speaker Two) Who you interact with, for the most part.
158; ;00:13:00,103 --> 00:13:08,338; ;Anyone who comes into my car, I don't get to choose that but I have to deal with it.
159; ;00:13:08,338 --> 00:13:19,957; ;And trying to provide an optimal riding experience while still trying to be safe on the road, while still trying to be pay attention and get there in the shortest amount of time possible.
160; ;00:13:19,957 --> 00:13:25,178; ;It's a lot of things to have a heightened awareness about for a sustained period of time.
161; ;00:13:25,178 --> 00:13:26,191; ;(Speaker One) Yeah.
162; ;00:13:26,191 --> 00:13:28,896; ;And so you say you did this...
163; ;00:13:30,719 --> 00:13:39,136; ;You do this next to your full-time job, so it sounds like it's really intense the driving, right, that what you described.
164; ;00:13:39,136 --> 00:13:40,644; ;(Speaker Two) It can be. It can be.
165; ;00:13:40,644 --> 00:13:46,081; ;And people ask me often, "You know, how long do you drive?
166; ;00:13:46,081 --> 00:13:47,655; ;How long will you drive today?"
167; ;00:13:47,655 --> 00:13:55,966; ;And my response always is "I'll drive as long as the people who come into my car are, you know, kind of relaxed and groovy."
168; ;00:13:57,719 --> 00:13:59,215; ;And as soon as that...
169; ;00:13:59,215 --> 00:14:02,927; ;And it's very much an energy thing, I know that sounds very...
170; ;00:14:02,927 --> 00:14:03,940; ;(Speaker One) Oh, no.
171; ;00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:05,631; ;(Speaker Two) New age-y and weird.
172; ;00:14:05,631 --> 00:14:15,409; ;But it's very much an energy thing as long as the energy is neutral or directionally positive, it's really easy for me to drive.
173; ;00:14:15,409 --> 00:14:19,864; ;And its fine and I can continue to do that for long periods of time.
174; ;00:14:19,864 --> 00:14:21,192; ;As it shifts...
175; ;00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:25,700; ;And, you know, there really is no defense for you.
176; ;00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:38,610; ;And if I'm putting myself in the position for someone who is trying to reintegrate and is just truly looking for a break and is really gonna put in the time and grind it out because they need the money...
177; ;00:14:38,615 --> 00:14:40,518; ;That could be a hard...
178; ;00:14:42,451 --> 00:14:44,397; ;I'll just say, mental adjustment.
179; ;00:14:44,397 --> 00:14:49,686; ;And I think the question I would have is, you know, do they have the interpersonal skills to be able to handle that?
180; ;00:14:49,686 --> 00:14:50,911; ;(Speaker One) Right, and what would be...
181; ;00:14:52,451 --> 00:14:57,362; ;If you're talking about these interpersonal skills, what do you think is necessary to be able to do this job?
182; ;00:14:58,546 --> 00:15:01,402; ;(Speaker Two) You have to be able to control your own emotions.
183; ;00:15:02,424 --> 00:15:04,065; ;You have to be able to...
184; ;00:15:04,065 --> 00:15:07,979; ;You know, being able to navigate and manage difficult situations without...
185; ;00:15:09,687 --> 00:15:21,170; ;Causing the situation to escalate, being able to know how to manage your situation so that any tension in the car is defused.
186; ;00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:34,532; ;Especially when, you know, you're in a Pool with three different drunk people, each of them having different, you know, views whether it's about life or the navigation of the car...
187; ;00:15:36,042 --> 00:15:38,304; ;You know, how do you handle that, how do you...
188; ;00:15:38,304 --> 00:15:41,750; ;So there's a lot of different I think situational...
189; ;00:15:43,149 --> 00:15:45,286; ;Behavioral components.
190; ;00:15:46,317 --> 00:15:50,850; ;Do I think people who are trying to reintegrate into society, can they do it?
191; ;00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:52,432; ;Of course, they can.
192; ;00:15:52,432 --> 00:15:54,848; ;But again, I think it's an opportunity.
193; ;00:15:56,078 --> 00:16:00,004; ;You know, if Uber is able to identify folks who...
194; ;00:16:02,297 --> 00:16:12,814; ;You know, may need some personalized like for example, if Uber entered into a formal program with some of the correctional or the diversion programs...
195; ;00:16:13,929 --> 00:16:26,651; ;With a different correctional facilities in the area or in any geographic area, and you had one on one, you know, help getting folks onboarded to Uber.
196; ;00:16:26,651 --> 00:16:30,100; ;And then a series of training courses to deal with...
197; ;00:16:31,912 --> 00:16:33,664; ;You know, interpersonal
198; ;00:16:35,286 --> 00:16:39,640; ;Interactions or, you know, those types of things...
199; ;00:16:41,175 --> 00:16:45,537; ;Part of it's setting a foundation so that they can be successful.
200; ;00:16:45,537 --> 00:16:46,954; ;(Speaker One) Yeah, so you are saying...
201; ;00:16:48,124 --> 00:16:51,003; ;(Speaker Two) Because the way platform is currently built, it's all self-service.
202; ;00:16:51,003 --> 00:16:52,411; ;(Speaker One) Yup.
203; ;00:16:52,411 --> 00:16:53,754; ;(Speaker Two) It's all self-service.
204; ;00:16:53,754 --> 00:17:02,286; ;So it's geared towards, let's call it the 90% who don't need any help and who just are gonna be plug and play...
205; ;00:17:02,286 --> 00:17:03,499; ;(Speaker One) Yeah. (Speaker Two) They can self-serve.
206; ;00:17:03,499 --> 00:17:06,054; ;And have all of the things they need to self-serve.
207; ;00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:21,006; ;But what you're, you know, the population are you targeting here is, let's just call it the 10% or the 5%, who is gonna need far more than just the plug and play experience.
208; ;00:17:21,006 --> 00:17:22,030; ;(Speaker One) And would you...
209; ;00:17:22,030 --> 00:17:31,913; ;You're suggesting training to learn how to deal with these situations, do you think would had have been helpful before you started driving with Uber?
210; ;00:17:31,913 --> 00:17:33,277; ;(Speaker Two) I didn't need that training.
211; ;00:17:33,277 --> 00:17:35,102; ;(Speaker One) But you think some people might need it?
212; ;00:17:35,102 --> 00:17:36,113; ;(Speaker Two) Yeah.
213; ;00:17:37,297 --> 00:17:49,827; ;You know, and there's folks who maybe one way you can do it and maybe or one way you could think about it is, you know, folks, drivers whose ratings are persistently low or lower,
214; ;00:17:51,517 --> 00:18:03,935; ;You know, trying to understand why that is and especially if you cross-plotted that data against, you know, prior record or whatever to see where are the trends, is it just...
215; ;00:18:03,935 --> 00:18:13,119; ;You know, what is the trend of drivers or what are the characteristics of the drivers who are consistently receiving, you know, really low ratings?
216; ;00:18:15,238 --> 00:18:25,798; ;And the types of comments that riders are leaving for those drivers and, you know, are there things that pop out.
217; ;00:18:25,798 --> 00:18:26,798; ;(Speaker One) Yeah.
218; ;00:18:26,798 --> 00:18:28,559; ;(Speaker Two) Like prior...
219; ;00:18:30,339 --> 00:18:43,420; ;You know, it's just are there ways to segregate or slice and dice the population of drivers to do target which ones might benefit from some additional support.
220; ;00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:46,880; ;(Speaker One) Yeah, and yeah, some...
221; ;00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:49,776; ;And then you're suggesting some training for those particular drivers.
222; ;00:18:49,776 --> 00:18:56,114; ;(Speaker Two) And it all depends upon, again, I think it all depends upon the stance that Uber takes.
223; ;00:18:56,114 --> 00:18:59,400; ;It's really like how invested are you in keeping your drivers.
224; ;00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,431; ;(Speaker One) Right.
225; ;00:19:00,431 --> 00:19:08,249; ;(Speaker Two) Because at one point in time, I would have said that Uber doesn't really care to keep its drivers because they have such a volume of people who wanted to drive.
226; ;00:19:08,249 --> 00:19:18,668; ;So didn't really matter if a driver dropped below, you know, with certain rating or was struggling, was having, you know, certain amount of negative comments, you just cancel the driver.
227; ;00:19:18,668 --> 00:19:22,269; ;And, you know, there's no conversation again, it's that whole plug and play automated...
228; ;00:19:22,269 --> 00:19:23,298; ;(Speaker One) Yeah.
229; ;00:19:23,298 --> 00:19:30,685; ;(Speaker Two) Kind of electronic process of you get an email that says you're no longer allowed to drive for Uber and your account is canceled.
230; ;00:19:30,685 --> 00:19:33,551; ;(Speaker One) You've heard that from people? (Speaker Two) Yes.
231; ;00:19:33,551 --> 00:19:36,909; ;So, you know, it's...
232; ;00:19:36,909 --> 00:19:40,854; ;So there is no conversation and there is no discussion around it.
233; ;00:19:40,854 --> 00:19:55,330; ;However, if Uber is shifting its stance and it really does want to retain drivers and it really does want to understand where an issue might be, you've got a shit-ton of data to mine and you could easily create cohorts within that data.
234; ;00:19:57,518 --> 00:20:05,726; ;I would think to identify populations of drivers that might benefit for some on the job training, even though were contractors.
235; ;00:20:05,726 --> 00:20:06,815; ;(Speaker One) Right.
236; ;00:20:06,815 --> 00:20:17,104; ;Yeah, that's really good feedback especially like you say about how to deal with these interpersonal situations with drivers and pools and yeah...
237; ;00:20:17,104 --> 00:20:18,149; ;(Speaker Two) It's not easy.
238; ;00:20:18,149 --> 00:20:19,671; ;(Speaker One) No, I totally understand that.
239; ;00:20:19,671 --> 00:20:20,721; ;Yeah that's...
240; ;00:20:21,771 --> 00:20:28,379; ;So you're saying, you've just mentioned that you drive until the energy turns negative.
241; ;00:20:28,379 --> 00:20:33,672; ;So can you talk a bit more about like when you drive, how do you decide to drive?
242; ;00:20:33,672 --> 00:20:38,405; ;I know you told me when you decide to stop driving, but can you tell me a little bit about your schedule?
243; ;00:20:38,405 --> 00:20:40,029; ;What does a normal week look like?
244; ;00:20:41,451 --> 00:20:46,908; ;(Speaker Two) My husband normally drives Monday through Thursday and then I'll drive Friday, Saturday, Sunday.
245; ;00:20:48,233 --> 00:20:54,539; ;Depending upon what's going on during the day, I might drive all day Friday and most of the night on Friday.
246; ;00:20:54,539 --> 00:20:59,000; ;Lately, it's been Friday nights, Saturday, and Sunday.
247; ;00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,358; ;(Speaker One) During the day?
248; ;00:21:00,358 --> 00:21:01,706; ;(Speaker Two) During the day and during the night.
249; ;00:21:01,706 --> 00:21:03,543; ;(Speaker One) Okay, those are long days.
250; ;00:21:03,543 --> 00:21:06,220; ;(Speaker Two) Very long days, very long days.
251; ;00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:08,653; ;(Speaker One) Yeah. How do you deal with that?
252; ;00:21:08,653 --> 00:21:13,141; ;(Speaker Two) It's fine. I work 16-hour days at my regular job.
253; ;00:21:13,141 --> 00:21:16,046; ;I'm not a stranger to hard work so...
254; ;00:21:17,061 --> 00:21:18,512; ;It is what it is.
255; ;00:21:18,512 --> 00:21:19,872; ;(Speaker One) Okay, that's interesting.
256; ;00:21:19,872 --> 00:21:25,623; ;How do you find the flexibility that Uber provides challenging or do you like it?
257; ;00:21:25,623 --> 00:21:26,893; ;I mean, you can decide when...
258; ;00:21:26,893 --> 00:21:28,385; ;(Speaker Two) I enjoy the flexibility.
259; ;00:21:28,385 --> 00:21:35,297; ;I think the frustration though and I understand from a business perspective, I actually, understand why this is the case.
260; ;00:21:37,033 --> 00:21:44,873; ;You know, obviously, the times where there are special bonus programs and what not, I'm not able to drive.
261; ;00:21:46,291 --> 00:21:52,063; ;So I don't know but I believe, but I do understand that from a business perspective.
262; ;00:21:52,063 --> 00:22:10,217; ;There's bonus or incentive programs are offered at certain times of the day because Uber is looking to maximize, you know, basically to gear or to shift production or inventory of drivers to a certain location at a certain point of time to meet anticipated demand.
263; ;00:22:10,217 --> 00:22:14,497; ;Like I get it intellectually, but from a driver's perspective...
264; ;00:22:16,370 --> 00:22:17,947; ;You know, it can be frustrating.
265; ;00:22:17,947 --> 00:22:29,409; ;And there have been times where I've decided, "Okay, I'm not going to drive tonight or I'm not going to drive this weekend because the bonus that's being offered to me is a joke."
266; ;00:22:29,409 --> 00:22:44,507; ;And you need that bonus because you guys have dropped rates to such a significant extent, there is no real profit in it, unless you're smart about the times and you can maximize the bonuses and the bonuses are worth it.
267; ;00:22:44,507 --> 00:22:49,087; ;Because you need the bonuses on top of the normal rates because of the rate cuts.
268; ;00:22:49,087 --> 00:22:51,826; ;(Speaker One) Right, so without the bonus it's not worth it?
269; ;00:22:51,826 --> 00:22:53,040; ;(Speaker Two) It's not worth it.
270; ;00:22:53,040 --> 00:23:05,085; ;There are times where I've had folks where I have taken them from the financial district all the way to the other side of the city and I've gotten $2.75.
271; ;00:23:05,085 --> 00:23:17,075; ;So your programs that you have to give riders, $2 rides anywhere within San Francisco, it's bullshit that you pass that on to the drivers because we have no choice.
272; ;00:23:18,149 --> 00:23:20,962; ;(Speaker One) I wasn't aware that the drivers would be paid so little then.
273; ;00:23:20,962 --> 00:23:21,982; ;(Speaker Two) Yes.
274; ;00:23:23,051 --> 00:23:29,554; ;That doesn't account for my time, it doesn't account for my gas, it doesn't account for wear and tear of my car, it doesn't account for my time away from my children.
275; ;00:23:29,554 --> 00:23:30,563; ;(Speaker One) Right.
276; ;00:23:30,563 --> 00:23:37,853; ;(Speaker Two) And I have to make that tradeoff and those decisions, all of that goes into my mental calculus for deciding if and when I'm gonna drive.
277; ;00:23:37,853 --> 00:23:38,875; ;(Speaker One) Yeah.
278; ;00:23:38,875 --> 00:23:40,841; ;(Speaker Two) It has to be worth it.
279; ;00:23:40,841 --> 00:23:45,304; ;(Speaker One) Is it hard to understand that in advance or are you...
280; ;00:23:45,304 --> 00:23:51,083; ;(Speaker Two) You don't know that until you finish the ride and you get paid.
281; ;00:23:51,083 --> 00:23:52,953; ;There are some...
282; ;00:23:52,953 --> 00:23:55,332; ;The example I just gave you wouldn't know that.
283; ;00:23:55,332 --> 00:24:07,679; ;Now if I am thinking about my weekends, so on Thursdays, we'll get an email that says, "here's, you know, the bonus that you're eligible for this weekend."
284; ;00:24:09,978 --> 00:24:12,689; ;You know, and I'll take a look at it and I'll do the math.
285; ;00:24:12,689 --> 00:24:24,037; ;And so when I first started driving, which is about a year ago, little bit more than a year ago, if you did between like 12 and 14 rides, you can make $200.
286; ;00:24:24,037 --> 00:24:29,348; ;Today, to make $200, you need to do about 26 rides.
287; ;00:24:29,348 --> 00:24:30,812; ;(Speaker One) Oh.
288; ;00:24:30,812 --> 00:24:35,800; ;(Speaker Two) That's how much you guys have reduced rates and margins for drivers.
289; ;00:24:36,933 --> 00:24:38,467; ;(Speaker One) Yeah, that sounds like a pretty big difference.
290; ;00:24:38,467 --> 00:24:42,405; ;(Speaker Two) It's an incredible amount of additional time spent in the car.
291; ;00:24:42,405 --> 00:24:56,371; ;And considering the fact that you can only really do like if I'm being very realistic and you're in San Francisco, you can do about three rides an hour, maybe four in San Francisco.
292; ;00:24:56,371 --> 00:25:06,414; ;So that additional, let's call it 12 rides is an additional 4 hours in the car to get the same amount of money.
293; ;00:25:06,414 --> 00:25:07,419; ;(Speaker One) Yeah.
294; ;00:25:09,147 --> 00:25:11,899; ;(Speaker Two) And that's frustrating. (Speaker One) Yeah.
295; ;00:25:11,899 --> 00:25:14,775; ;(Speaker Two) It's incredibly frustrating.
296; ;00:25:14,775 --> 00:25:29,519; ;You know, and again, from a business perspective, I completely understand that they need to be competitive with Lyft and sort of the dynamics of trying to recover reputation with riders because you needed the demand to be there.
297; ;00:25:31,137 --> 00:25:36,054; ;So the rate drops and the booking fee drops and kind of all of those things.
298; ;00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:42,818; ;But your suppliers are your inventory of drivers like...
299; ;00:25:42,818 --> 00:25:46,230; ;And it's not that we don't want to work hard and we don't want...
300; ;00:25:46,230 --> 00:25:48,703; ;That's not it, we just want to be compensated fairly.
301; ;00:25:48,703 --> 00:25:51,634; ;(Speaker One) Yeah. Yeah, that's fair.
302; ;00:25:51,634 --> 00:25:56,463; ;(Speaker Two) And it would really, you know, and someone who...
303; ;00:25:56,463 --> 00:26:12,569; ;So if, you know, kind of if we're rotating back to someone who's reintegrating and is going to use this as their primary mode of employment or gaining funds to support their life...
304; ;00:26:17,419 --> 00:26:22,920; ;When you layer on, so there's trying to figure out how to deal with people.
305; ;00:26:24,383 --> 00:26:30,224; ;Trying to get together the resources to be able to drive, so getting on the platform and then having a vehicle to drive.
306; ;00:26:31,645 --> 00:26:34,669; ;Then you layer on the pricing or the margin pressure...
307; ;00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:37,193; ;That the drivers have.
308; ;00:26:37,193 --> 00:26:39,278; ;I don't know that it's a winning proposition...
309; ;00:26:39,278 --> 00:26:40,281; ;(Speaker One) Yeah.
310; ;00:26:40,281 --> 00:26:42,693; ;(Speaker Two) For someone who needs this... (Speaker One) Yeah.
311; ;00:26:42,693 --> 00:26:45,061; ;(Speaker Two) As a full-time job. (Speaker One) Yeah.
312; ;00:26:46,117 --> 00:26:55,590; ;(Speaker Two) I mean, someone like me who's using this as a part-time job, I can totally see why Uber would tell me to go pound sand, this is not, like I can see why.
313; ;00:26:56,970 --> 00:27:02,571; ;But somebody who's trying to reintegrate and build their life, can they do it?
314; ;00:27:04,449 --> 00:27:05,981; ;Considering all of what's there to face.
315; ;00:27:05,981 --> 00:27:09,988; ;(Speaker One) Yeah, your things might not be enough to because I was curious.
316; ;00:27:09,988 --> 00:27:19,985; ;So does Uber help you to make your ends meet and then you're saying, well, this is my part time job, it's additional.
317; ;00:27:19,985 --> 00:27:24,073; ;(Speaker Two) And that's how it helps me to make my ends meet but it still has to be worth it for me.
318; ;00:27:24,073 --> 00:27:25,086; ;(Speaker One) Yeah.
319; ;00:27:25,086 --> 00:27:28,077; ;And but you're kind of saying, if this were my full-time job only...
320; ;00:27:28,077 --> 00:27:29,990; ;(Speaker Two) No way, no way...
321; ;00:27:31,191 --> 00:27:34,862; ;No way, and that's part of as much as I'm a driver, I'm also a rider.
322; ;00:27:34,862 --> 00:27:35,878; ;(Speaker One) Yeah.
323; ;00:27:35,878 --> 00:27:37,269; ;(Speaker Two) And that's a thing I talk to other drivers about.
324; ;00:27:38,438 --> 00:27:40,583; ;(Speaker One) What do you mean when you talk to other...
325; ;00:27:40,583 --> 00:27:49,906; ;(Speaker Two) So I always ask drivers and I always identify myself as a driver as I'm riding with other Uber drivers and I ask them, "How long have you been driving?
326; ;00:27:49,906 --> 00:27:53,867; ;And, you know, how do you feel about driving for Uber?"
327; ;00:27:53,867 --> 00:27:56,861; ;And kind of, "Has your experience changed over time?"
328; ;00:27:56,861 --> 00:27:58,431; ;And blah, blah, blah, blah.
329; ;00:27:58,431 --> 00:28:05,243; ;And I've been lucky enough to talk with folks who have been driving with Uber for three or four years.
330; ;00:28:05,243 --> 00:28:18,126; ;So they've seen the trajectory, and they've seen the change and how profitable and lucrative it was for them in year four, year three going downhill in year two, in year one, they're miserable and are looking for a way out.
331; ;00:28:18,126 --> 00:28:19,145; ;(Speaker One) Yeah.
332; ;00:28:20,229 --> 00:28:23,961; ;And this is due to mostly, you feel, due to the rates that have been dropped.
333; ;00:28:23,961 --> 00:28:25,462; ;(Speaker Two) Oh, yes.
334; ;00:28:25,462 --> 00:28:28,526; ;And the booking fees, all of it.
335; ;00:28:28,526 --> 00:28:29,528; ;(Speaker One) Yeah.
336; ;00:28:29,528 --> 00:28:35,934; ;(Speaker Two) And then you guys upped the booking fees again, but then you kept them for Uber, you didn't pass on that increase back...
337; ;00:28:37,099 --> 00:28:39,111; ;(Speaker Two) To the drivers. (Speaker One) Yeah.
338; ;00:28:39,111 --> 00:28:40,755; ;Yeah, I see how frustrating that can be.
339; ;00:28:40,755 --> 00:28:44,572; ;(Speaker Two) And it's just and it's very frustrating because we're not employees.
340; ;00:28:46,594 --> 00:28:52,201; ;And drivers should have some sort of way to set rates.
341; ;00:28:53,275 --> 00:29:01,900; ;Yeah, we're using the app and we're paying you a commission or a service fee for using the app that's been built.
342; ;00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:05,135; ;And, you know, and it's another thing, when people...
343; ;00:29:05,135 --> 00:29:09,649; ;People always want to talk to me about Uber. They want to talk.
344; ;00:29:09,649 --> 00:29:17,243; ;And one of the things that I made very clear is Uber is a technology company, it's not a transportation company, you should understand that upfront.
345; ;00:29:17,243 --> 00:29:23,021; ;It is a technology company that happens to be addressing transportation at the moment.
346; ;00:29:24,397 --> 00:29:29,878; ;Primarily, there's other things that Uber does, but right now it's transportation primarily.
347; ;00:29:31,855 --> 00:29:37,361; ;And also I get it, I understand, but that doesn't necessarily compel me...
348; ;00:29:38,542 --> 00:29:39,742; ;To...
349; ;00:29:41,672 --> 00:29:47,529; ;Want to contribute as a contractor when I know I'm not getting a fair shake.
350; ;00:29:47,529 --> 00:29:48,633; ;(Speaker One) Yeah.
351; ;00:29:48,633 --> 00:29:54,477; ;Yeah, I think that's really frustrating if you feel like you're not being paid enough even though you understand the system.
352; ;00:29:54,477 --> 00:29:58,832; ;(Speaker Two) I understand the business and I understand and, you know, I've listened...
353; ;00:30:02,956 --> 00:30:08,738; ;And have read, you know, some of Travis's comments on...
354; ;00:30:10,430 --> 00:30:15,277; ;You know, the role of drivers and what drivers should and should not, and it's...
355; ;00:30:16,611 --> 00:30:18,115; ;It's pretty egregious.
356; ;00:30:21,651 --> 00:30:30,864; ;We are people and we have dignity and we have integrity and we're out trying to make things work, not just for Uber but for our families.
357; ;00:30:30,864 --> 00:30:32,191; ;(Speaker One) Yeah.
358; ;00:30:32,191 --> 00:30:39,046; ;(Speaker Two) And, you know, if Uber, I think, stepped back and really thought about it...
359; ;00:30:41,162 --> 00:30:45,790; ;Your best ambassador for your brand are your drivers...
360; ;00:30:47,705 --> 00:30:49,244; ;100%.
361; ;00:30:49,244 --> 00:30:51,196; ;(Speaker One) And why would you say that that's the case?
362; ;00:30:51,196 --> 00:30:54,891; ;(Speaker Two) Because everyone wants to talk about Uber when they get in my car.
363; ;00:30:56,216 --> 00:31:02,434; ;And if it's happening with me, it's happening across multiply that by all of your drivers...
364; ;00:31:02,434 --> 00:31:03,455; ;(Speaker One) Yeah.
365; ;00:31:03,455 --> 00:31:04,603; ;(Speaker Two) And every...
366; ;00:31:04,603 --> 00:31:10,610; ;So first question that's always asked of me is, "So how long have you been driving for Uber? What do you think about it?"
367; ;00:31:11,877 --> 00:31:18,192; ;Every single... So if I give 20 rides, at least 18 of those are going to start with that question.
368; ;00:31:19,472 --> 00:31:22,114; ;(Speaker One) Yeah, you're the face of Uber for them.
369; ;00:31:22,114 --> 00:31:23,551; ;(Speaker Two) For sure.
370; ;00:31:23,551 --> 00:31:25,494; ;And I'm the face of Uber for you.
371; ;00:31:25,494 --> 00:31:27,373; ;(Speaker One) Yeah. No, I agree with you.
372; ;00:31:27,373 --> 00:31:29,717; ;(Speaker Two) And it's...
373; ;00:31:30,737 --> 00:31:47,039; ;There's a lot of opportunity, you know, I know that the whole 100-day of change program and there's aspects of that that I'm excited about, although, you know, one change item was rolled out and then it was pulled back which was disappointing.
374; ;00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:48,554; ;(Speaker One) Which was that?
375; ;00:31:48,554 --> 00:32:00,172; ;(Speaker Two) So the destination trips we were previously allocated only two a day, and that was increased to six, and now it's back down to two.
376; ;00:32:00,172 --> 00:32:01,608; ;(Speaker One) Oh, I didn't know that.
377; ;00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:05,940; ;(Speaker Two) Yeah, very frustrating because that was actually really helpful.
378; ;00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:14,660; ;Because I actually made myself a promise when I started driving for Uber that I would go no matter where the rider took me.
379; ;00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:30,614; ;And there have been several instances where I've been, "Okay, it's 12:30, perhaps my most egregious one was up way in Marin 12:30 at night.
380; ;00:32:30,614 --> 00:32:32,851; ;I'm like, "Okay, I'll do one more ride and then I'll go home."
381; ;00:32:32,851 --> 00:32:36,204; ;Pick that person up all the way to Atherton.
382; ;00:32:38,679 --> 00:32:40,023; ;(Speaker One) In the middle of the night.
383; ;00:32:40,023 --> 00:32:41,028; ;(Speaker Two) In the middle of the night.
384; ;00:32:41,028 --> 00:32:50,331; ;And having that destination, if I had had the ability to have the destination trip, I could have avoided that.
385; ;00:32:51,561 --> 00:32:53,073; ;(Speaker One) Did you consider canceling?
386; ;00:32:54,927 --> 00:32:59,319; ;(Speaker Two) I considered it but I had made myself a promise.
387; ;00:32:59,319 --> 00:33:05,550; ;And I've had it happen to me where I've gotten...
388; ;00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:14,308; ;So if I miss my last bus, I need to take some sort of ride share home, public transportation is not great to Marin.
389; ;00:33:15,456 --> 00:33:23,933; ;And I've had it happen to me where I've gotten in the car, the driver swipes, sees where I'm going and has told me to get out of the car, and it's humiliating.
390; ;00:33:25,450 --> 00:33:26,468; ;(Speaker One) So you don't want that happen to others.
391; ;00:33:26,468 --> 00:33:28,580; ;(Speaker Two) I will never do that to another person...
392; ;00:33:30,461 --> 00:33:35,408; ;Never, so having tools that allow me to better manage...
393; ;00:33:35,408 --> 00:33:37,100; ;(Speaker One) Prevent that from happening.
395; ;00:33:38,432 --> 00:33:49,799; ;The other one that I'm very hopeful to see implemented is the one that actually pays you for your travel time to pick up a rider because...
396; ;00:33:52,405 --> 00:33:53,577; ;Up in Marin...
397; ;00:33:53,577 --> 00:33:57,500; ;So it's very different driving in Marin versus driving in San Francisco.
394; ;00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:38,432; ;(Speaker Two) Prevent that from happening.
398; ;00:33:57,500 --> 00:34:03,388; ;Driving in Marin, you can drive 15 to 25 minutes to pick up your rider.
399; ;00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:23,565; ;And so if I was very disappointed when you guys allowed Pool up in Marin because why would I drive 20 minutes to go pick someone up to take them on a 10 minute pool.
400; ;00:34:23,565 --> 00:34:25,189; ;(Speaker Two) Why would I do that? (Speaker One) Yeah.
401; ;00:34:25,189 --> 00:34:27,841; ;(Speaker Two) The economics don't make sense.
402; ;00:34:27,841 --> 00:34:30,224; ;So I won't take those rides now.
403; ;00:34:30,224 --> 00:34:31,738; ;(Speaker Two) I just, I won't. (Speaker One) Yeah.
404; ;00:34:31,738 --> 00:34:35,270; ;(Speaker Two) It's not even money earning proposition.
405; ;00:34:35,270 --> 00:34:36,471; ;(Speaker One) Yeah.
406; ;00:34:36,471 --> 00:34:46,215; ;(Speaker Two) However, if I know that I'm getting paid to go and travel and get them, I'm getting paid for my time and my distance, I think I'm willing to do that.
407; ;00:34:46,215 --> 00:34:47,254; ;(Speaker One) Yeah.
408; ;00:34:48,565 --> 00:34:49,649; ;(Speaker Two) It's more equitable.
409; ;00:34:49,649 --> 00:34:52,820; ;(Speaker One) Yeah, it makes sense if you have to drive 15 minutes for a 10-minute ride.
410; ;00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:53,833; ;(Speaker Two) For sure.
411; ;00:34:53,833 --> 00:34:55,608; ;(Speaker One) Yeah, it doesn't make sense, yeah.
412; ;00:34:57,571 --> 00:35:00,941; ;And what will you be...
413; ;00:35:00,941 --> 00:35:07,132; ;I mean, I know you're driving with Uber in an addition to your normal day job.
414; ;00:35:07,132 --> 00:35:10,583; ;Well, if you couldn't drive with Uber, what would you do instead?
415; ;00:35:10,583 --> 00:35:11,888; ;(Speaker Two) I'd drive for Lyft.
416; ;00:35:11,888 --> 00:35:14,458; ;(Speaker One) Okay. Did you consider that?
417; ;00:35:14,458 --> 00:35:17,651; ;(Speaker Two) I did, I consider... I have not signed up with any other...
418; ;00:35:17,651 --> 00:35:22,770; ;Like, I just... I don't believe in doing that.
419; ;00:35:22,770 --> 00:35:24,623; ;I think it's ridiculous.
420; ;00:35:24,623 --> 00:35:41,160; ;That some drivers, you know, they've got two phones, both apps open, it's just, you know, up until I would say, kind of all of the fallout with everything that's happened corporate-wise here with Uber.
421; ;00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:44,847; ;Uber certainly had the volumes to support, to keep me busy.
422; ;00:35:47,115 --> 00:36:00,898; ;And, yes, during the initial sign-up period, if I hadn't heard back from Uber and gotten resolution, I totally would have just signed up with Lyft.
423; ;00:36:00,898 --> 00:36:02,663; ;(Speaker One) Yeah, and you were just...
424; ;00:36:02,663 --> 00:36:06,426; ;If so, it would have been another few weeks you would have gone to Lyft?
425; ;00:36:06,426 --> 00:36:07,802; ;(Speaker Two) Yeah, I just...
426; ;00:36:09,127 --> 00:36:10,902; ;(Speaker Two) Exactly. (Speaker One) Yeah.
427; ;00:36:10,902 --> 00:36:15,781; ;Did you consider other types of earning additional money, other ways of doing it?
428; ;00:36:17,582 --> 00:36:18,909; ;(Speaker Two) That had been...
429; ;00:36:18,909 --> 00:36:27,624; ;It's funny you would ask that question because I'm actually going through that decision making process now because we're not making enough money driving for Uber.
430; ;00:36:27,624 --> 00:36:28,642; ;We're not.
431; ;00:36:28,642 --> 00:36:30,938; ;So looking for other...
432; ;00:36:34,121 --> 00:36:37,362; ;Types of flexible...
433; ;00:36:39,735 --> 00:36:42,914; ;Opportunities to bring in additional income.
434; ;00:36:42,914 --> 00:36:45,066; ;(Speaker One) And what kind of things are you considering?
435; ;00:36:45,066 --> 00:36:47,238; ;(Speaker Two) Actually, medical marijuana delivery.
436; ;00:36:47,238 --> 00:36:49,087; ;(Speaker One) Oh, wow!
437; ;00:36:49,087 --> 00:36:51,825; ;That's interesting. How does that work?
438; ;00:36:51,825 --> 00:36:53,818; ;(Speaker Two) Same as Uber.
439; ;00:36:53,818 --> 00:36:57,041; ;(Speaker One) And it seemed like some kind of app that you use, people ask...
440; ;00:36:57,041 --> 00:36:58,302; ;(Speaker Two) Same as Uber.
441; ;00:36:58,302 --> 00:36:59,336; ;(Speaker One) Interesting.
442; ;00:36:59,336 --> 00:37:00,747; ;Is it fairly new or...
443; ;00:37:00,747 --> 00:37:01,767; ;(Speaker Two) No. (Speaker One) Okay.
444; ;00:37:01,767 --> 00:37:14,413; ;(Speaker Two) It's been around for a couple of years and I expect that it will probably grow in popularity as marijuana usage is fully legalized, especially in Bay area.
445; ;00:37:14,413 --> 00:37:16,737; ;(Speaker One) Okay, have you tried it or you're still considering?
446; ;00:37:16,737 --> 00:37:17,761; ;(Speaker Two) Considering.
447; ;00:37:17,761 --> 00:37:25,837; ;I mean, there's certainly a lot of stigma that goes around with that and would want to make sure that it's fully legal first.
448; ;00:37:25,837 --> 00:37:26,858; ;(Speaker One) Yeah.
449; ;00:37:26,858 --> 00:37:29,877; ;(Speaker Two) Before I would do anything like that because that could jeopardize my day job.
450; ;00:37:29,877 --> 00:37:31,338; ;(Speaker One) Yeah. Yeah.
451; ;00:37:31,338 --> 00:37:35,754; ;And are there any other things that you consider instead of driving with Uber?
452; ;00:37:37,436 --> 00:37:40,493; ;(Speaker Two) That's really the only one because it's the most lucrative.
453; ;00:37:40,493 --> 00:37:41,617; ;I'm looking for...
454; ;00:37:41,617 --> 00:37:52,720; ;We're looking at different, you know, only entertain something that would give us more income in driving for Uber, not equal or less.
455; ;00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:54,878; ;(Speaker One) Yeah. Yeah.
456; ;00:37:54,878 --> 00:37:56,797; ;(Speaker One) So the income is the biggest part why... (Speaker Two) Oh, for sure.
457; ;00:37:56,797 --> 00:37:58,528; ;(Speaker One) The biggest reason why you drive for Uber?
458; ;00:37:58,528 --> 00:38:00,899; ;(Speaker Two) It is a 100% the reason why I drive for Uber.
459; ;00:38:00,899 --> 00:38:01,925; ;(Speaker One) Yeah.
460; ;00:38:01,925 --> 00:38:04,775; ;(Speaker Two) Because it's additional to my day job.
461; ;00:38:04,775 --> 00:38:06,159; ;(Speaker One) Yeah, yeah.
462; ;00:38:06,159 --> 00:38:07,191; ;And...
463; ;00:38:08,194 --> 00:38:13,090; ;So you're saying income, that's the 100% reason why you drive for Uber.
464; ;00:38:13,090 --> 00:38:17,294; ;Are there any other reasons or benefits you get from driving with Uber?
465; ;00:38:17,294 --> 00:38:19,459; ;(Speaker One) Yeah, I get a nice tax deduction.
466; ;00:38:19,459 --> 00:38:20,671; ;(Speaker One) Oh, nice.
467; ;00:38:20,671 --> 00:38:22,244; ;For... Like, you know...
468; ;00:38:22,244 --> 00:38:26,112; ;(Speaker Two) Well, because I'm a contractor, I'm a sole proprietor of my own business.
469; ;00:38:26,112 --> 00:38:30,738; ;So I can write off all my expenses, I can write off my car payment, I can write off...
470; ;00:38:30,738 --> 00:38:33,423; ;I mean, it's definitely a tax play.
471; ;00:38:33,423 --> 00:38:37,274; ;(Speaker One) And are there any other things that you think are...
472; ;00:38:37,274 --> 00:38:38,291; ;(Speaker Two) No.
473; ;00:38:39,364 --> 00:38:40,689; ;No other benefit.
474; ;00:38:40,689 --> 00:38:44,915; ;(Speaker One) And if you think about like do you enjoy meeting the people or that's not a benefit?
475; ;00:38:44,915 --> 00:38:46,120; ;(Speaker Two) No. (Speaker One) Okay.
476; ;00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:47,406; ;(Speaker Two) I don't like people.
477; ;00:38:47,406 --> 00:38:48,650; ;(Speaker One) You don't, okay.
478; ;00:38:48,650 --> 00:38:50,677; ;(Speaker Two) The other reason why...
479; ;00:38:50,677 --> 00:38:53,446; ;I mean, I said that facetiously but I'm not a...
480; ;00:38:53,446 --> 00:38:56,049; ;I mean, I'm sure you can tell I'm not a people person.
481; ;00:38:56,049 --> 00:38:57,714; ;I have some pretty sharp edges.
482; ;00:39:00,406 --> 00:39:09,815; ;One thing that driving for Uber forces me to do is, I mean, I'd much rather be silent and do my work and then have to...
483; ;00:39:09,815 --> 00:39:12,142; ;It takes a lot of energy for me.
484; ;00:39:12,142 --> 00:39:19,826; ;And driving for Uber, there's a certain amount of extroversion that is required to be a successful driver.
485; ;00:39:19,826 --> 00:39:21,761; ;That does not come natural to me.
486; ;00:39:21,761 --> 00:39:23,311; ;So one of the things...
487; ;00:39:24,944 --> 00:39:40,709; ;I've said this to my husband before, you know, a side benefit of driving for Uber is that it really does force me and I even mean, force, it forces me to work on my people skills.
488; ;00:39:41,977 --> 00:39:47,361; ;And how I'm able to interact, which I can then take back with me to my day job.
489; ;00:39:47,361 --> 00:39:48,451; ;(Speaker One) Yeah.
490; ;00:39:48,451 --> 00:39:49,525; ;(Speaker Two) Is there a restroom I can use?
491; ;00:39:49,525 --> 00:39:51,958; ;(Speaker One) Yes, of course. (Speaker Two) Thank you. I'm sorry.
492; ;00:39:51,958 --> 00:39:54,743; ;(Speaker One) I have to think about where exactly the restroom is here.
493; ;00:39:56,599 --> 00:39:57,629; ;(Speaker Two) Can I leave my purse there?
494; ;00:39:57,629 --> 00:39:58,697; ;(Speaker One) Yes. (Speaker Two) Okay.
495; ;00:40:04,175 --> 00:40:07,205; ;(Speaker Two) You know where the restrooms are on this block. (Speaker Three) What?
496; ;00:40:07,205 --> 00:40:09,661; ;(Speaker Two) Do you know where the restrooms are on this block? (Speaker Three) Sure.
497; ;00:44:24,840 --> 00:44:27,990; ;(Speaker One) But it's kind of hard to reach people because...
498; ;00:44:27,990 --> 00:44:29,000; ;(Speaker Two) Really?
499; ;00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,044; ;(Speaker One) Well, it's...
500; ;00:44:31,319 --> 00:44:33,321; ;(Speaker Two) You had me at Amazon gift card.
501; ;00:44:33,321 --> 00:44:35,759; ;(Speaker One) Yeah, of course. (Speaker Two) You totally did.
502; ;00:44:35,759 --> 00:44:39,092; ;(Speaker One) And I think it's fair that, that people are being...
503; ;00:44:39,092 --> 00:44:40,136; ;(Speaker Two) You had me.
504; ;00:44:41,916 --> 00:44:44,805; ;(Speaker One) I think it's probably because people don't read their email.
505; ;00:44:44,805 --> 00:44:47,371; ;So they don't even see our invitations.
506; ;00:44:48,438 --> 00:44:49,467; ;This is why...
507; ;00:44:49,467 --> 00:44:50,489; ;(Speaker Two) Oh, really?
508; ;00:44:50,489 --> 00:44:53,408; ;(Speaker One) We have... I mean, we have people who are interested for sure.
509; ;00:44:54,837 --> 00:44:55,891; ;But...
510; ;00:44:57,630 --> 00:44:59,902; ;Yeah, not that many, so...
511; ;00:44:59,902 --> 00:45:01,809; ;(Speaker Two) I'm surprised. I'm really surprised.
512; ;00:45:01,809 --> 00:45:05,928; ;(Speaker Two) Yeah. So let me go see...
513; ;00:45:05,928 --> 00:45:14,871; ;So I know one of the reasons why we wanted to talk with you is because we thought you had a record, but you're saying that must have been someone else's record.
514; ;00:45:14,871 --> 00:45:19,286; ;But you did say you have records that should have been expunged.
515; ;00:45:19,286 --> 00:45:20,756; ;(Speaker Two) Correct.
516; ;00:45:20,756 --> 00:45:24,461; ;(Speaker One) You don't need to tell me anything about what it was.
517; ;00:45:24,461 --> 00:45:30,248; ;I would still love to ask some questions about reintegration and if it's not relevant, you can just tell me because...
518; ;00:45:30,248 --> 00:45:31,276; ;(Speaker Two) Okay, go ahead.
519; ;00:45:31,276 --> 00:45:35,310; ;(Speaker One) I don't know what it was like, so...
520; ;00:45:35,310 --> 00:45:42,479; ;This is probably not relevant because I would like to know that how did you know that your history wouldn't keep you from driving with Uber, but I guess, I thought...
521; ;00:45:42,479 --> 00:45:43,641; ;(Speaker Two) Legally it shouldn't have.
522; ;00:45:43,641 --> 00:45:46,230; ;(Speaker One) Yeah. So that's not relevant.
523; ;00:45:46,230 --> 00:45:50,034; ;So...
524; ;00:45:50,034 --> 00:45:52,191; ;Maybe...
525; ;00:45:52,191 --> 00:45:58,255; ;So since these questions are targeting to people who have other records which probably aren't yours.
526; ;00:45:58,255 --> 00:46:03,846; ;Can you tell me a little bit more about whether you experienced reintegration from your...
527; ;00:46:03,846 --> 00:46:04,902; ;(Speaker Two) No.
528; ;00:46:04,902 --> 00:46:07,286; ;(Speaker One) Okay.
529; ;00:46:07,286 --> 00:46:09,157; ;(Speaker Two) No. Total non-issue.
530; ;00:46:09,157 --> 00:46:14,145; ;(Speaker One) Because this is something that was expunged so it wasn't big enough.
531; ;00:46:14,145 --> 00:46:15,638; ;(Speaker Two) It has not impacted my life.
532; ;00:46:15,638 --> 00:46:17,515; ;(Speaker One) Right. Okay.
533; ;00:46:17,515 --> 00:46:19,661; ;So I'm just going to read these questions 'cause...
534; ;00:46:19,661 --> 00:46:20,669; ;(Speaker Two) No worries.
535; ;00:46:20,669 --> 00:46:28,039; ;(Speaker One) To myself 'cause I think they're all irrelevant but I just want to make sure that maybe we can ask them in a different way.
536; ;00:46:31,767 --> 00:46:36,862; ;When you started driving with Uber, now you're considering other things, right?
537; ;00:46:36,862 --> 00:46:37,936; ;We just talked about that.
538; ;00:46:37,936 --> 00:46:41,411; ;When you started driving with Uber, did you consider other ways of making money at the time?
539; ;00:46:41,411 --> 00:46:43,538; ;(Speaker Two) No.
540; ;00:46:43,538 --> 00:46:48,088; ;(Speaker One) Why were you attracted to Uber?
541; ;00:46:48,088 --> 00:46:51,645; ;(Speaker Two) You guys are very visible.
542; ;00:46:51,645 --> 00:47:05,968; ;And it really made sense at the time that in terms of at that time, Uber was considered best in class from a ride sharing perspective and the fact that Uber at that time had the volumes.
543; ;00:47:05,968 --> 00:47:12,662; ;It felt like it would be worth my time to drive for Uber and I could accomplish my financial goal.
544; ;00:47:12,662 --> 00:47:16,204; ;(Speaker One) Yeah because if you would have driven for another, there might not have been enough ride or...
545; ;00:47:16,204 --> 00:47:17,233; ;(Speaker Two) The same volume.
546; ;00:47:17,233 --> 00:47:18,259; ;(Speaker One) Yeah.
547; ;00:47:18,259 --> 00:47:19,272; ;(Speaker Two) Correct.
548; ;00:47:19,272 --> 00:47:24,225; ;(Speaker One) That makes sense. Yeah. And...
549; ;00:47:24,225 --> 00:47:26,461; ;Let's see.
550; ;00:47:30,419 --> 00:47:39,192; ;Sometimes people feel like what they do for work becomes part of their life or who they are as a person.
551; ;00:47:39,192 --> 00:47:40,603; ;Do you feel...
552; ;00:47:40,603 --> 00:47:42,480; ;(Speaker Two) Totally does.
553; ;00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:46,757; ;(Speaker One) And how does driving with Uber like how does that...
554; ;00:47:46,757 --> 00:47:49,158; ;(Speaker Two) That means I haven't figured it out in my real life.
555; ;00:47:49,158 --> 00:47:54,800; ;The fact that I have to have a second job and this isn't Uber specific.
556; ;00:47:54,800 --> 00:48:05,461; ;Although people will ask me, you know, "Amy, you have strongly held views about women and women's roles, why would you continue to drive for a company like Uber?"
557; ;00:48:05,461 --> 00:48:08,573; ;That's been my mental calculus in the past six months.
558; ;00:48:08,573 --> 00:48:12,048; ;Why do I continue to drive for Uber?
559; ;00:48:12,048 --> 00:48:13,053; ;(Speaker One) Yeah.
560; ;00:48:13,053 --> 00:48:16,963; ;(Speaker Two) Given the corporate culture?
561; ;00:48:16,963 --> 00:48:20,470; ;You know, I had the opportunity to meet Arianna Huffington when I was at...
562; ;00:48:20,470 --> 00:48:31,826; ;I used to work for one of the Bulge Bracket banks in New York and had the opportunity to listen to her speak at length, I just...
563; ;00:48:31,826 --> 00:48:51,736; ;And what I tell people is look, you know, I'm hopeful and I'm trying to be hopeful, remain hopeful, that Uber's management is not going to take what is just purely in concept a really great thing for a lot of people.
564; ;00:48:53,175 --> 00:49:00,100; ;I love the fact that Uber has completely lowered the driving under the influence rates.
565; ;00:49:00,100 --> 00:49:02,567; ;It saves lives for people.
566; ;00:49:02,567 --> 00:49:13,956; ;There is no excuse to get behind the wheel impaired because Uber has made it, so that's the case.
567; ;00:49:13,956 --> 00:49:20,460; ;You know, and for all the reasons, you know, I think there's a lot to be proud of with Uber.
568; ;00:49:23,144 --> 00:49:32,289; ;But there has to be some sort of come-to-Jesus moment in figuring out the corporate culture.
569; ;00:49:32,289 --> 00:49:41,322; ;You know, one thing I do you think and I don't know if Uber has ever considered this or seriously considered it...
570; ;00:49:41,322 --> 00:49:51,012; ;One of the comments that I get a lot is they love the fact that I'm a female driver and people would pay a premium for a female driver.
571; ;00:49:51,012 --> 00:50:00,523; ;I mean, obviously, you'd have to figure out how that would work in the algorithm because you wouldn't want to match a skeevy guy 'cause he's requested a woman.
572; ;00:50:00,523 --> 00:50:04,501; ;But there are a lot of riders who have told me, "I would pay extra."
573; ;00:50:04,501 --> 00:50:06,600; ;(Speaker One) And why would they do that?
574; ;00:50:06,600 --> 00:50:10,432; ;(Speaker Two) Because they feel safer with someone of their own sex.
575; ;00:50:10,432 --> 00:50:15,442; ;(Speaker One) Yes, so you're thinking like women, women matching algorithm would be really good?
576; ;00:50:15,442 --> 00:50:20,421; ;(Speaker Two) I think women would pay extra for that.
577; ;00:50:20,421 --> 00:50:22,277; ;(Speaker One) Yeah. And...
578; ;00:50:22,277 --> 00:50:26,359; ;(Speaker Two) If there was some way for riders to...
579; ;00:50:26,359 --> 00:50:37,025; ;Yes, it infinitely complicates things when you add that sort of customization into their request.
580; ;00:50:37,025 --> 00:50:43,044; ;But I've also had riders say, "You know, I would just pay to upgrade my driver."
581; ;00:50:43,044 --> 00:50:51,928; ;You know, even talking about the car, they'd pay to upgrade my driver to someone who could speak to me intelligently in English.
582; ;00:50:51,928 --> 00:50:56,514; ;I mean, and, yes, there are racist tones to that.
583; ;00:50:56,514 --> 00:51:01,077; ;So I think what I'm trying to highlight is that there is an...
584; ;00:51:01,077 --> 00:51:03,259; ;I think there is an...
585; ;00:51:03,259 --> 00:51:17,465; ;Perhaps, unexplored opportunity to give riders an option that they would pay for to do some selecting of drivers.
586; ;00:51:17,465 --> 00:51:18,755; ;(Speaker One) Yeah.
587; ;00:51:18,755 --> 00:51:27,193; ;And so you were talking about corporate culture and that this really made you question whether you should continue to drive with Uber...
588; ;00:51:27,193 --> 00:51:28,344; ;(Speaker Two) Correct.
589; ;00:51:28,344 --> 00:51:31,124; ;(Speaker One) And...
590; ;00:51:31,124 --> 00:51:32,467; ;Does that mean that...
591; ;00:51:32,467 --> 00:51:43,786; ;Before that you mentioned that driving with Uber shows that you're not able to make enough money with your normal job.
592; ;00:51:43,786 --> 00:51:45,049; ;(Speaker Two) Correct.
593; ;00:51:45,049 --> 00:51:49,613; ;(Speaker One) Do you feel like driving with Uber is almost like kind of a stigma or...
594; ;00:51:49,613 --> 00:51:51,801; ;(Speaker Two) Right now it is.
595; ;00:51:51,801 --> 00:51:53,125; ;(Speaker One) And how do you notice that?
596; ;00:51:53,125 --> 00:51:54,126; ;Do people say things?
597; ;00:51:54,126 --> 00:51:56,232; ;(Speaker Two) Because people tell me.
598; ;00:51:56,232 --> 00:51:57,299; ;(Speaker One) What kind of...
599; ;00:51:57,299 --> 00:51:58,486; ;(Speaker Two) I get a lot of shit for driving for Uber.
600; ;00:51:58,486 --> 00:51:59,517; ;(Speaker One) Oh, yeah?
601; ;00:51:59,517 --> 00:52:00,539; ;(Speaker Two) Yeah, I do.
602; ;00:52:00,539 --> 00:52:01,579; ;(Speaker One) What kind of things did they tell you?
603; ;00:52:01,579 --> 00:52:05,273; ;(Speaker Two) How could you be a woman and drive for Uber?
604; ;00:52:05,273 --> 00:52:06,372; ;(Speaker One) And what else?
605; ;00:52:06,372 --> 00:52:10,499; ;(Speaker Two) Why would you work at a company that's run by a chauvinistic asshole pig?
606; ;00:52:10,499 --> 00:52:12,938; ;Why would you do that?
607; ;00:52:12,938 --> 00:52:14,040; ;(Speaker One) People still say that?
608; ;00:52:14,040 --> 00:52:15,093; ;(Speaker Two) Yes.
609; ;00:52:15,093 --> 00:52:16,258; ;(Speaker One) They know we have a new CEO?
610; ;00:52:16,258 --> 00:52:17,955; ;(Speaker Two) Correct.
611; ;00:52:17,955 --> 00:52:22,407; ;But Travis isn't gone.
612; ;00:52:22,407 --> 00:52:33,748; ;I mean, he may be fully marginalized, he may be at the perimeter, but he's not gone and his name is still in the press.
613; ;00:52:33,748 --> 00:52:46,000; ;You know, there definitely is a stigma right now in terms of driving for Uber, my...
614; ;00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:51,880; ;Which then leads me into the conversation, well, here's part of the reason why I drive for Uber because these are the things that I'm proud of.
615; ;00:52:51,880 --> 00:52:52,909; ;(Speaker One) Yeah.
616; ;00:52:52,909 --> 00:53:02,770; ;(Speaker Two) I'm proud of the fact that this is a thing for the deaf community like I've had two deaf drivers before and I think it's fucking fantastic that they feel enfranchised.
617; ;00:53:02,770 --> 00:53:04,610; ;(Speaker One) Yeah.
618; ;00:53:04,610 --> 00:53:05,610; ;(Speaker Two) When...
619; ;00:53:05,610 --> 00:53:14,446; ;In the absence of ridesharing, they may not have felt enfranchised and may not have had a way back in.
620; ;00:53:14,446 --> 00:53:31,451; ;I love the fact that Uber can create opportunity and it also is a real safety in terms of significantly reduced driving while intoxicated rates.
621; ;00:53:31,451 --> 00:53:33,505; ;(Speaker One) Yeah.
622; ;00:53:33,505 --> 00:53:35,039; ;(Speaker Two) I mean, and that's huge.
623; ;00:53:35,039 --> 00:53:36,876; ;So that's what I talk about.
624; ;00:53:36,876 --> 00:53:38,295; ;(Speaker One) With riders?
625; ;00:53:38,295 --> 00:53:39,437; ;(Speaker Two) When I get a hard time.
626; ;00:53:39,437 --> 00:53:40,455; ;(Speaker One) Yeah.
627; ;00:53:40,455 --> 00:53:43,548; ;Is it mostly riders who give you a hard time or friends and family?
628; ;00:53:43,548 --> 00:53:45,123; ;(Speaker Two) Riders.
629; ;00:53:45,123 --> 00:53:46,330; ;(Speaker One) So how do your friend...
630; ;00:53:46,330 --> 00:53:51,620; ;What do your friends and family think?
631; ;00:53:51,620 --> 00:53:55,398; ;(Speaker Two) My sister thinks it's ridiculous that I drive for Uber.
632; ;00:53:55,398 --> 00:53:57,521; ;(Speaker One) Why does she think that?
633; ;00:53:57,521 --> 00:54:03,401; ;(Speaker Two) Because she feels that at this stage of my life, I should be able to manage my life with one income.
634; ;00:54:03,401 --> 00:54:09,713; ;My parents are concerned that I drive for Uber because they're worried about my safety.
635; ;00:54:09,713 --> 00:54:11,136; ;(Speaker One) Are you ever worried about yourself?
636; ;00:54:11,136 --> 00:54:14,463; ;(Speaker Two) Yes. Yes.
637; ;00:54:14,463 --> 00:54:18,668; ;(Speaker One) When? Like what situations?
638; ;00:54:18,668 --> 00:54:26,453; ;(Speaker Two) It can get really challenging.
639; ;00:54:26,453 --> 00:54:27,546; ;Like I actually...
640; ;00:54:27,546 --> 00:54:32,089; ;I recently had a situation where I picked up a guy.
641; ;00:54:32,089 --> 00:54:34,575; ;He was totally drunk.
642; ;00:54:34,575 --> 00:54:41,393; ;And as he got out of the car like he came behind me and was touching me and he kissed me.
643; ;00:54:41,393 --> 00:54:44,558; ;I'm just like, "Oh, my God."
644; ;00:54:44,558 --> 00:54:46,941; ;And I'm just like, "Don't."
645; ;00:54:46,941 --> 00:54:53,079; ;And I didn't see him coming because he was coming behind me from the backseat.
646; ;00:54:53,079 --> 00:55:01,169; ;And, you know, it's stuff like that happens very rarely.
647; ;00:55:01,169 --> 00:55:04,916; ;I only have a handful of all the rides.
648; ;00:55:04,916 --> 00:55:11,559; ;I think I've given like a bit over a 1000 rides I think.
649; ;00:55:11,559 --> 00:55:12,652; ;(Speaker One) Wow.
650; ;00:55:12,652 --> 00:55:20,882; ;(Speaker Two) I mean, not a huge amount but, and of those, I think maybe I have three or four stories.
651; ;00:55:20,882 --> 00:55:22,824; ;But, you know, it really only takes one.
652; ;00:55:22,824 --> 00:55:24,416; ;(Speaker One) Yeah, it does.
653; ;00:55:24,416 --> 00:55:25,458; ;Did you...
654; ;00:55:25,458 --> 00:55:29,255; ;(Speaker Two) And immediately after that ride, I stopped further riding.
655; ;00:55:29,255 --> 00:55:30,990; ;(Speaker One) Yeah, I know.
656; ;00:55:30,990 --> 00:55:33,435; ;Did you report these incidents to Uber?
657; ;00:55:33,435 --> 00:55:37,123; ;(Speaker Two) I did. I did.
658; ;00:55:37,123 --> 00:55:38,515; ;(Speaker one) That's good.
659; ;00:55:38,515 --> 00:55:42,172; ;That's important because otherwise, we can't block such riders, right?
660; ;00:55:42,172 --> 00:55:43,325; ;(Speaker Two) Oh, for sure.
661; ;00:55:43,325 --> 00:55:47,139; ;(Speaker One) Yeah, I'm sorry to hear that you had this experience and that's rough.
662; ;00:55:47,139 --> 00:55:56,489; ;(Speaker Two) Yeah, I mean, I had one guy who got in my car and he only spoke at a scream, so he screamed the whole way.
663; ;00:55:56,489 --> 00:56:01,499; ;(Speaker One) Are these things mostly night time rides or...
664; ;00:56:01,499 --> 00:56:13,251; ;(Speaker Two) I did have one during the day where I picked up a woman and it was a long ride, she wanted to go from San Anselmo to Berkeley.
665; ;00:56:13,251 --> 00:56:18,840; ;We got about a mile from her house and I had the radio on very low.
666; ;00:56:24,435 --> 00:56:32,427; ;So we got about a mile from her house and she goes, "Two things. One, I prefer silence, so please turn off the radio."
667; ;00:56:32,427 --> 00:56:33,788; ;"Okay, that's fine."
668; ;00:56:33,788 --> 00:56:36,960; ;"Two, only speak when you're spoken to."
669; ;00:56:41,845 --> 00:56:43,820; ;And...
670; ;00:56:43,820 --> 00:56:44,839; ;Sure.
671; ;00:56:44,839 --> 00:56:48,043; ;I could have pulled over to the side of the road.
672; ;00:56:48,043 --> 00:56:55,576; ;I could have asked her to get out of my car, but she was in her late 60s, she's somebody's grandmother.
673; ;00:56:59,447 --> 00:57:01,238; ;But it's an awful...
674; ;00:57:01,238 --> 00:57:12,520; ;You know, if you put someone who is truly a convicted felon, he's trying to reintegrate in that sort of environment, that rider is going to be left on the side of the road.
675; ;00:57:12,520 --> 00:57:13,553; ;(Speaker One) Yeah.
676; ;00:57:13,553 --> 00:57:22,734; ;(Speaker Two) Because they're not going to have the personal fortitude to suck it in and deliver the experience...
677; ;00:57:22,734 --> 00:57:23,752; ;(Speaker One) Yeah.
678; ;00:57:23,752 --> 00:57:25,481; ;(Speaker Two) That Uber expects us to deliver.
679; ;00:57:25,481 --> 00:57:28,653; ;(Speaker One) Yeah.
680; ;00:57:28,653 --> 00:57:32,395; ;(Speaker Two) That's probably my most egregious...
681; ;00:57:32,395 --> 00:57:34,052; ;(Speaker One) Did she not say anything the entire...
682; ;00:57:34,052 --> 00:57:37,074; ;(Speaker Two) Nope. Nope.
683; ;00:57:37,074 --> 00:57:39,233; ;(Speaker One) Wow.
684; ;00:57:39,233 --> 00:57:40,475; ;That's pretty rude.
685; ;00:57:40,475 --> 00:57:41,562; ;(Speaker Two) Yep.
686; ;00:57:41,562 --> 00:57:42,804; ;(Speaker One) Yeah.
687; ;00:57:42,804 --> 00:57:47,365; ;(Speaker Two) And that's why it's not that I wish rude experiences on anyone, I don't.
688; ;00:57:47,365 --> 00:57:57,298; ;That's why I'm really passionate about the idea that everyone who works for the corporate office needs to get in a car and do the job.
689; ;00:57:57,298 --> 00:57:58,613; ;(Speaker One) Yeah.
690; ;00:57:58,613 --> 00:57:59,720; ;(Speaker Two) And not just once.
691; ;00:57:59,720 --> 00:58:00,753; ;(Speaker One) Yeah.
692; ;00:58:00,753 --> 00:58:05,940; ;(Speaker Two) Like for a good 30 days, 20 to 30 hours a week, all different...
693; ;00:58:05,940 --> 00:58:13,523; ;And when I first started, I deliberately drove all different times of the day, all different days of the week because I wanted to see how things varied...
694; ;00:58:13,523 --> 00:58:14,586; ;(Speaker One) Yeah.
695; ;00:58:14,586 --> 00:58:19,080; ;(Speaker Two) How people varied.
696; ;00:58:19,080 --> 00:58:30,191; ;You know, my very first ride I ever gave, the person, I don't know if you've ever been up in Mill Valley, lots of hills, very difficult to navigate.
697; ;00:58:30,191 --> 00:58:31,312; ;(Speaker One) Yeah.
698; ;00:58:31,312 --> 00:58:33,612; ;(Speaker Two) And you lose cell phone service.
699; ;00:58:33,612 --> 00:58:35,333; ;(Speaker One) Oh.
700; ;00:58:35,333 --> 00:58:47,440; ;(Speaker Two) So very first ride was taking a girl from the mall up to her crazy home in Mill Valley and I couldn't find her place and she wouldn't help me navigate and she told me, "Well, that's your job to know."
701; ;00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:50,488; ;Like "Well, you may not get home."
702; ;00:58:50,488 --> 00:58:53,581; ;And that was my first ever.
703; ;00:58:53,581 --> 00:58:54,794; ;It was awful.
704; ;00:58:54,794 --> 00:59:02,274; ;I'm pretty sure she gave me 0 or 1 for a rating.
705; ;00:59:02,274 --> 00:59:06,161; ;And I had gone home that night and told my husband like, "I don't think I can do this."
706; ;00:59:06,161 --> 00:59:08,125; ;(Speaker One) Yeah.
707; ;00:59:08,125 --> 00:59:10,623; ;That's a terrible first experience.
708; ;00:59:10,623 --> 00:59:12,104; ;(Speaker Two) Yeah.
709; ;00:59:12,104 --> 00:59:14,627; ;So but again...
710; ;00:59:14,627 --> 00:59:17,498; ;(Speaker One) Why did you persevere?
711; ;00:59:17,498 --> 00:59:22,103; ;(Speaker Two) Because that's what I do and that's what I've been trained to do in my day job.
712; ;00:59:22,103 --> 00:59:25,883; ;I mean, that's the life that I have.
713; ;00:59:25,883 --> 00:59:30,913; ;You don't know that everyone...
714; ;00:59:30,913 --> 00:59:47,647; ;I think a lot of people also would persevere, but I don't know that this specific sort of cross-section of people that you're targeting with this research study, I think it would be a question mark for me as to whether or not that group...
715; ;00:59:47,647 --> 00:59:54,011; ;Because even though I'm not an employee for Uber, I'm very conscious of the fact that I am a brand ambassador.
716; ;00:59:54,011 --> 00:59:56,010; ;(Speaker One) Yeah.
717; ;00:59:56,010 --> 01:00:09,170; ;(Speaker Two) And I think even though the way the model is currently set up, where we're all contractors, we're something more than contractors, we're not full-fledged employees, but we're something more than contractors.
718; ;01:00:12,763 --> 01:00:20,833; ;And it would be helpful, I think, to all parties if like Uber would actually acknowledge that.
719; ;01:00:20,833 --> 01:00:24,805; ;(Speaker One) Yeah, you're feeling like you're not acknowledged, not for the role that you play.
720; ;01:00:24,805 --> 01:00:25,956; ;(Speaker Two) Exactly.
721; ;01:00:25,956 --> 01:00:32,815; ;(Speaker One) Yeah, that's, that's a very good feedback.
722; ;01:00:32,815 --> 01:00:40,880; ;So you talked a lot about the challenges you've had or especially when you started, mostly it was the sign-up process.
723; ;01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:44,929; ;Are there any challenges that you haven't talked about or hard times?
724; ;01:00:44,929 --> 01:00:45,937; ;(Speaker Two) Nope.
725; ;01:00:45,937 --> 01:00:47,750; ;(Speaker One) Are there any...
726; ;01:00:47,750 --> 01:00:50,435; ;And you talked a little bit about good things that you like about Uber.
727; ;01:00:50,435 --> 01:00:54,528; ;Is there anything else there that you haven't talked about, that you like about Uber or...
728; ;01:00:54,528 --> 01:00:56,196; ;(Speaker Two) Nope, I have been very transparent.
729; ;01:00:56,196 --> 01:00:58,717; ;(Speaker One) Okay, great.
730; ;01:00:58,717 --> 01:01:07,747; ;You also told me about how you, like, don't like interacting with riders and that you prefer to be silent.
731; ;01:01:07,747 --> 01:01:15,747; ;(Speaker Two) I do, if I had my way, I'm naturally very introverted, very naturally introverted.
732; ;01:01:15,747 --> 01:01:16,754; ;(Speaker One) Yeah.
733; ;01:01:16,754 --> 01:01:19,923; ;(Speaker Two) And I could go an entire day without saying a single word.
734; ;01:01:19,923 --> 01:01:21,230; ;(Speaker One) Yeah.
735; ;01:01:21,230 --> 01:01:30,955; ;(Speaker Two) And so driving for Uber forces me to operate against or to act against sort of my natural...
736; ;01:01:30,955 --> 01:01:34,648; ;Which is positive and I got that idea actually from...
737; ;01:01:34,648 --> 01:01:45,954; ;I went through a period where I had a lot of drivers who were engineers at like Google or Apple or whatever...
738; ;01:01:45,954 --> 01:01:53,598; ;Who were driving in part, not because they needed the cash but because they wanted to work on their people skills and they wanted to network and I just, I'm like, "That's brilliant."
739; ;01:01:53,598 --> 01:02:01,184; ;That's a brilliant way to address that gap or that perceived gap.
740; ;01:02:01,184 --> 01:02:02,223; ;(Speaker One) Yeah.
741; ;01:02:02,223 --> 01:02:04,805; ;(Speaker Two) And, you know, get paid to address it.
742; ;01:02:04,805 --> 01:02:05,822; ;(Speaker One) Yeah.
743; ;01:02:05,822 --> 01:02:06,860; ;(Speaker Two) That's awesome.
744; ;01:02:06,860 --> 01:02:08,864; ;(Speaker One) Yeah. Exactly.
745; ;01:02:08,864 --> 01:02:14,217; ;Well, that's good that even though that's a very challenging part of your job, you see there's something positive as well, right?
746; ;01:02:14,217 --> 01:02:16,693; ;(Speaker Two) Yeah. And it's necessary.
747; ;01:02:16,693 --> 01:02:19,733; ;And it's something that I can then take and apply.
748; ;01:02:19,733 --> 01:02:20,827; ;(Speaker One) Yeah.
749; ;01:02:20,827 --> 01:02:21,872; ;(Speaker Two) To my day job.
750; ;01:02:21,872 --> 01:02:22,949; ;(Speaker One) Yeah. That's great.
751; ;01:02:22,949 --> 01:02:26,353; ;That's a very good point.
752; ;01:02:26,353 --> 01:02:28,440; ;Then I'm just curious, what are...
753; ;01:02:28,440 --> 01:02:33,936; ;If you're not driving with Uber, if you're not working for the bank, what kind of things do you like to do for fun?
754; ;01:02:33,936 --> 01:02:37,829; ;(Speaker Two) I have two small kids, so all my time is geared towards my kids.
755; ;01:02:37,829 --> 01:02:38,896; ;(Speaker One) How old are they?
756; ;01:02:38,896 --> 01:02:41,418; ;(Speaker Two) I don't do anything for fun for myself.
757; ;01:02:41,418 --> 01:02:44,171; ;I have a four-year-old and a six-year-old.
758; ;01:02:44,171 --> 01:02:51,356; ;So two little boys, so any time that I have leftover, which is very little, is devoted solely to my children.
759; ;01:02:51,356 --> 01:02:53,427; ;(Speaker One) What kind of things do you like to do with them?
760; ;01:02:58,254 --> 01:03:00,458; ;(Speaker Two) They just want to play.
761; ;01:03:00,458 --> 01:03:12,097; ;I mean, it's not sophisticated, there's nothing fancy, they just wanna play and they just want to see their mom and they just want to be happy.
762; ;01:03:12,097 --> 01:03:14,532; ;So it's really simple.
763; ;01:03:14,532 --> 01:03:21,873; ;(Speaker One) Yeah, so you're saying you have your full-time job then you have your driving job, how do you handle...
764; ;01:03:21,873 --> 01:03:23,191; ;(Speaker Two) I get about an hour a day.
765; ;01:03:23,191 --> 01:03:24,564; ;(Speaker One) To see your kids?
766; ;01:03:24,564 --> 01:03:25,929; ;(Speaker Two) I get about an hour a day.
767; ;01:03:25,929 --> 01:03:28,065; ;(Speaker One) Wow. Who takes care of them when you...
768; ;01:03:28,065 --> 01:03:29,639; ;(Speaker Two) My husband.
769; ;01:03:29,639 --> 01:03:31,004; ;We trade-off.
770; ;01:03:31,004 --> 01:03:32,761; ;(Speaker One) So he gets to spend more time with them or...
771; ;01:03:32,761 --> 01:03:33,827; ;(Speaker Two) He does.
772; ;01:03:33,827 --> 01:03:34,958; ;He's the primary caregiver.
773; ;01:03:34,958 --> 01:03:37,179; ;(Speaker One) Okay. Yeah.
774; ;01:03:37,179 --> 01:03:49,756; ;So does the flexibility of Uber help with you being able to spend time with your kids or your work is just too much you can't spend enough time with your kids?
775; ;01:03:49,756 --> 01:03:58,059; ;(Speaker Two) Yeah, the flexibility of Uber helps but again, you know, in order to get these 20 rides or these 40 rides or whatever to get a bonus, you've got to be out on the road.
776; ;01:03:58,059 --> 01:04:01,203; ;And I know I could do three, about three hours.
777; ;01:04:01,203 --> 01:04:16,012; ;So if I'm doing, you know, if I'm trying to hit the 40-ride bonus, you know, I know I'm going to be in the car for at least 13 hours.
778; ;01:04:16,012 --> 01:04:17,562; ;(Speaker One) Yeah. Yeah.
779; ;01:04:17,562 --> 01:04:18,891; ;(Speaker Two) And, you know, how do you allocate that?
780; ;01:04:18,891 --> 01:04:20,388; ;It's crazy.
781; ;01:04:20,388 --> 01:04:22,306; ;(Speaker One) Yeah. It's a good point.
782; ;01:04:22,306 --> 01:04:24,212; ;(Speaker Two) Like it is what it is.
783; ;01:04:24,212 --> 01:04:27,114; ;(Speaker One) Yeah, that's true.
784; ;01:04:27,114 --> 01:04:29,841; ;(Speaker Two) It's just like do the math, take a look at the margins.
785; ;01:04:29,841 --> 01:04:31,403; ;(Speaker One) Yeah.
786; ;01:04:31,403 --> 01:04:32,454; ;(Speaker Two) It's all there.
787; ;01:04:32,454 --> 01:04:34,485; ;(Speaker One) Yeah.
788; ;01:04:34,485 --> 01:04:39,952; ;Is there anything else that we didn't discuss that you would like to say or they...
789; ;01:04:39,952 --> 01:04:41,785; ;(Speaker Two) Thank you for taking the time to talk to me.
790; ;01:04:41,785 --> 01:04:46,528; ;I can't imagine it's been very easy to hear me, not be happy. So...
791; ;01:04:46,528 --> 01:04:49,173; ;(Speaker One) No, no, I mean, this is why we do the research.
792; ;01:04:49,173 --> 01:04:53,247; ;If people aren't happy, how can we otherwise improve anything?
793; ;01:04:53,247 --> 01:04:57,021; ;If people say everything is awesome, then there's nothing to improve, right?
794; ;01:04:57,021 --> 01:05:00,369; ;So it's really helpful for us to hear from you.
795; ;01:05:00,369 --> 01:05:04,205; ;(Speaker Two) Well, it's really important to me even though, you know, it was quite...
796; ;01:05:04,205 --> 01:05:05,610; ;It took a lot for me to get here.
797; ;01:05:05,610 --> 01:05:07,675; ;(Speaker One) Yeah.
798; ;01:05:07,675 --> 01:05:13,935; ;(Speaker Two) You know, and to be here on time and to take time away from my day job, like, it took a lot from me to be here.
799; ;01:05:13,935 --> 01:05:27,333; ;But I feel so strongly and so passionately about really wanting, like I want Uber to work, and I want it to be better and I want it to be the company that it can be.
800; ;01:05:27,333 --> 01:05:28,560; ;I just... I'm sorry.
801; ;01:05:28,560 --> 01:05:29,582; ;(Speaker One) No, that's okay.
802; ;01:05:29,582 --> 01:05:31,416; ;(Speaker Two) Like I've spent a lot of time thinking about this.
803; ;01:05:31,416 --> 01:05:38,652; ;My husband and I talk about it all the time, I talk about it all the time with riders like I'm not...
804; ;01:05:38,652 --> 01:05:42,305; ;It's just there's so much promise and there's so much opportunity here.
805; ;01:05:42,305 --> 01:05:47,055; ;(Speaker One) Yeah.
806; ;01:05:47,055 --> 01:05:55,859; ;(Speaker Two) And I realize that Uber is trying to balance a lot of competing interests, like I totally get it.
807; ;01:05:55,859 --> 01:06:06,707; ;And I wish there was a real way that I could show or explain to as many people as possible that work at Uber like...
808; ;01:06:06,707 --> 01:06:16,383; ;"You guys have so fucked your drivers with the margin compression so, so badly."
809; ;01:06:16,383 --> 01:06:17,417; ;(Speaker One) Yeah.
810; ;01:06:17,417 --> 01:06:19,520; ;(Speaker Two) And it's not sustainable.
811; ;01:06:19,520 --> 01:06:20,795; ;(Speaker One) No.
812; ;01:06:20,795 --> 01:06:25,315; ;(Speaker Two) And, you know, I'm sure...
813; ;01:06:25,315 --> 01:06:37,003; ;Well, I mean, you guys have the data, you can see the attrition, you can see, you know, the amount coming on versus the amount of drivers rolling off or inactive.
814; ;01:06:37,003 --> 01:06:44,747; ;I mean, because there was a period where I did not drive for a while because I was trying to figure out, okay.
815; ;01:06:44,740 --> 01:06:56,200; ;You know, how am I going to respond to how do I really feel about the corporate culture and kind of what I'm reading and, you know, what I'm hearing.
816; ;01:06:56,200 --> 01:07:00,390; ;You know, what choices do I need to be making.
817; ;01:07:00,396 --> 01:07:02,299; ;So it all plays into the mental calculus.
818; ;01:07:02,299 --> 01:07:03,790; ;(Speaker One) Yeah.
819; ;01:07:03,790 --> 01:07:19,766; ;(Speaker Two) I just feel like Uber at its core is such an amazing idea and it's such a wonderful thing.
820; ;01:07:19,766 --> 01:07:21,286; ;You know, the whole self...
821; ;01:07:21,280 --> 01:07:23,580; ;People want to talk to me about the self-driving cars too.
822; ;01:07:23,580 --> 01:07:34,250; ;Like I spend more time talking about Uber than I do about the own company that I work for full-time.
823; ;01:07:34,253 --> 01:07:36,203; ;And, you know, people have asked me.
824; ;01:07:36,203 --> 01:07:38,720; ;Well, what do you think about self-driving cars, blah, blah, blah?
825; ;01:07:38,720 --> 01:07:44,470; ;I'm like, "I think it's great. I think you need to understand that Uber is the technology company first and foremost."
826; ;01:07:44,470 --> 01:07:50,723; ;I think the question to be answered, and maybe not even answered at this point.
827; ;01:07:50,723 --> 01:08:06,168; ;But just talked about and discussed is, "Does Uber have a role, if any, in rescaling or retooling folks who are drivers that they brought into employment..."
828; ;01:08:06,168 --> 01:08:09,855; ;(Speaker One) Yeah.
829; ;01:08:09,855 --> 01:08:22,396; ;(Speaker Two) Rescaling or retooling, is there some sort of social obligation that when we do move to self-driving cars and the technology does advance and kind of all of these really amazing great things?
830; ;01:08:22,396 --> 01:08:30,494; ;I mean, I grew up in a time where I watched The Jetsons, I'm ready for my Turbo Pod like I think it's fantastic.
831; ;01:08:30,494 --> 01:08:43,903; ;And if Uber can get its house in order, will disrupt, again, and will continue to disrupt because that's what this company does and it should do that.
832; ;01:08:43,903 --> 01:08:45,502; ;But what happens to the deaf folks?
833; ;01:08:45,502 --> 01:08:58,685; ;What happens to, you know, the people who can't work a 9 to 5, who were brought in and could earn and take care of their families or supplement their income - like what happens to all of those people?
1; ;00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:05,020; ;Welcome to the Health Check using XMCLI demonstration.
2; ;00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:14,040; ;This demo covers how to generate the procedure and perform the Health Check Script on an XtremIO X2 cluster using XMCLI commands.
3; ;00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:20,980; ;To begin, we're going to open up the Dell EMC SolVe Desktop, select "XtremIO" and click "Next".
4; ;00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:26,880; ;Next, we'll select "Service Scripts and Utilities" and click "Next" again.
5; ;00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:31,820; ;Here we will select "XtremIO System Health Check" and click "Next".
6; ;00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:35,880; ;Click "Generate" to generate the procedure.
7; ;00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:41,400; ;Here we can see the XtremIO System Health Check procedure has been generated.
8; ;00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:52,040; ;Here in the table of contents, we see we have some preliminary activity tasks, and then we have instructions of how to perform the XtremIO System Health Check.
9; ;00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:54,960; ;Here we can see the Preliminary Activity Tasks.
10; ;00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:59,740; ;We must read, understand and possibly perform the tasks listed in Table 1.
11; ;00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:04,120; ;Table 1 lists the top 10 service topics related to this activity.
12; ;00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:15,080; ;If you are not familiar with any of the Top 10 Service Topics, click on the link to explore thoroughly before continuing with the Health Check Script procedure.
13; ;00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:30,660; ;Here we see an overview of the procedure: our cluster impact, our execution options, in a table listing our applicable XIO versions.
14; ;00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:37,100; ;Our first task is to determine the XtremIO cluster's index number and active software version.
15; ;00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:49,880; ;To do that, let's establish a secure shell session to the XMS.
16; ;00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:53,700; ;Here we are logged in as a tech user.
17; ;00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:57,740; ;Issue the shell cluster's info command.
18; ;00:01:57,740 --> 00:02:06,100; ;Here, we can see the cluster index is 1 and the software version is 6.0.0-55.
19; ;00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:11,180; ;Issue the shell-scripts command to determine if the applicable health check script is already uploaded.
20; ;00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:14,900; ;If the health check script is already uploaded, you can skip to task 2.
21; ;00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:19,300; ;In this case, the health check script has not been uploaded.
22; ;00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:27,960; ;To upload the system health check script to the XMS, we need to establish an FTP session to the cluster's XMS using the XMS upload account.
23; ;00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:35,840; ;We'll need to upload the System Health Check that corresponds with the active version of XtremIO, which we just registered in the previous step.
24; ;00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:40,480; ;This needs to be uploaded to the XMS's /images/scripts directory.
25; ;00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:48,660; ;So if we scroll down, we can see our 6.0.0 version of the System Health Check.
26; ;00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:58,580; ;If we click on the XtremIO Signed Script Library link, it brings us to our local directory in which the system health scripts are located.
27; ;00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:07,860; ;For ease of use, I'll just copy this to my desktop.
28; ;00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:19,200; ;Here, we have our WinSCP application open, and we're going to browse to the desktop.
29; ;00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:29,400; ;And we'll copy the System Health Check over to the script's directory.
30; ;00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:35,060; ;Our next test is to issue the run-script command.
31; ;00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:39,180; ;Let's issue the show-scripts command first.
32; ;00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:47,700; ;And then run the run-scripts command.
33; ;00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:53,860; ;Here we can see that the System Health Check is executing.
34; ;00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:56,500; ;This takes a few moments, so we will skip ahead.
35; ;00:03:56,500 --> 00:04:05,980; ;Here, we see the General Cluster Configuration Information and our System Health Check results.
36; ;00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:10,960; ;Here, we can see that the health scripts executed successfully.
37; ;00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:20,300; ;Looking back at our procedure...
38; ;00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:28,900; ;Here, we can see that if all checks pass and the script's closing message is "Health scripts executed successfully," no additional action is required.
39; ;00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:32,460; ;The cluster can be deemed healthy and operational.
40; ;00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:43,920; ;However, if any of the System Health Check is marked as failed, and the closing output of the script displays a message of "Errors found while executing the system health scripts," please review the relevant items and re-run.
41; ;00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:47,200; ;Proceed to the next task sequence in this procedure.
42; ;00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:53,260; ;As we can see, task 4 is performing cluster remediation in the event the System Health Check failed.
43; ;00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:57,680; ;This would include generating a log file bundle.
44; ;00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:03,480; ;This completes the Health Check using XMCLI demonstration.
1; ;00:00:01,250 --> 00:00:07,770; ;So we'll look at the MiTrend, NAR MiTrend path.
2; ;00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:13,020; ;And this path is going to enable us to create a performance solution for one or more existing systems.
3; ;00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:20,790; ;So we're going to take a NAR file or MiTrend file, we'll input that and then we want to create a solution based upon that input.
4; ;00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:26,550; ;And we're going to use that historical performance files or the MiTrend file to do that.
5; ;00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:34,900; ;We're going to combine that in a single configuration and then the result is going to be a combined list of what they term as performance groups.
6; ;00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:47,160; ;Which are nothing more than a bunch of LUNs with similar performance that are separated into groups based upon those characteristics like access pan, access mean, IO size, etc.
7; ;00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:57,130; ;And this approach is best suited when the design is going to require or be required for an existing system or subsystems.
8; ;00:00:59,650 --> 00:01:01,280; ;So I start the main menu.
9; ;00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:07,040; ;I can see I come to the NAR/MiTrend path entry here, or I can do it from the icon as well.
10; ;00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:13,040; ;So I'll just double click on that or click on it and it will launch the window.
11; ;00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:17,720; ;It will have you go ahead and upload a NAR or MiTrend file.
12; ;00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:27,190; ;If you had a previously uploaded file, you could use the previous uploads tab to do that, so I could click on that text.
13; ;00:01:27,190 --> 00:01:29,810; ;You could see, in this case, I have one already previously uploaded.
14; ;00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:42,590; ;I could select that and add it or I could go ahead out and choose the file from a dropdown, of which case it would come and allow me to choose NAR file from the directory in which it was located.
15; ;00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:50,470; ;Once I've done that, I have a couple of options.
16; ;00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:54,020; ;I can go ahead and look at advanced options, we will do that in a bit.
17; ;00:01:54,020 --> 00:02:02,400; ;Advanced options are going to let you really change the way the LUNs are grouped within the various pools.
18; ;00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:06,980; ;If not, if you just choose to take the default, you're going to have a summary over here.
19; ;00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:18,300; ;This one happens to be based off a 5600VNX, 25 LUNs, with the total capacity IOPS in megabytes per second.
20; ;00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:20,900; ;And so it's going to give me a solution based upon that.
21; ;00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:22,260; ;Let's see what it does.
22; ;00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:34,910; ;Now again, this should be an all-flash array, comes up, and in this case, we see a 550, the raw capacity that they figured out.
23; ;00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:48,120; ;It's only 2U, so it's simply requiring, in this case, 23 drives with any single TPE, and the usable capacity, effective capacity, so the pool information.
24; ;00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:56,840; ;Again, we've mentioned earlier, it takes LUNs of similar characteristics and groups them in their respective pools and that's what is done here.
25; ;00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:05,150; ;I have a non-busy with inline compression, being all-flash, and a pool that is small random with inline compression.
26; ;00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:17,170; ;First of which has 10 drives and a rate 5.8.1 configuration, and then the second one has a total of 13 drives, hence my total of 23.
27; ;00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:26,070; ;And then they have the picture over here, and you could go ahead and add your connectivity options if you want as well.
28; ;00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:31,770; ;So that was the Flash recommendation.
29; ;00:03:31,770 --> 00:03:35,520; ;We could also do a similar function for the hybrid.
30; ;00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,530; ;Let me show you how that's done.
31; ;00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:43,690; ;So I'm going to upload the same file.
32; ;00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:55,440; ;But I need to go to the advanced options and the advanced options are going to give me the option to change to a hybrid system.
33; ;00:03:55,440 --> 00:04:08,650; ;So you can see now based on the profile for a flash I have in my compression as we saw before, I'm going to change to hybrid, and when I do so I need to reset that configuration.
34; ;00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:16,730; ;And based upon that information, I can see I have options.
35; ;00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:30,910; ;Again, I have two groups and these groups are really LUNs, these two groups based upon the LUNs within those groups and those LUNs have similar characteristics, IO size, access paths, etcetera, performance rates.
36; ;00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:48,970; ;So I can actually change those and put them in one pool if I choose to do so, but what the size will do is it will break them into two pools, again, based upon those characteristics which is better for performance.
37; ;00:04:50,270 --> 00:05:01,710; ;So in this case, I selected the cache, you can see down here as well I have different groups and many number of groups.
38; ;00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:05,700; ;The group has to be present here in the convert groups to be available.
39; ;00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:19,450; ;In other words, if I go to Oracle ASM, for example, I see no LUNs in there, it has to be one of these, so for example, the non-busy, these are the LUNs in there.
40; ;00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:35,740; ;I can move those down to another group with short LUNs, I could move it down individual LUNs if I chose to do so, or I could select all the LUNs in there and move all the LUNs down to the destination group here, which I haven't yet configured.
41; ;00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:47,180; ;But if I did that, I would configure with the small random, and if I want to move again, for example, a single LUN I select a single LUN, I move it on down to the destination.
42; ;00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:54,120; ;The destination LUNs remain the same, it just adds the source LUN in there from the source group.
43; ;00:05:54,120 --> 00:06:01,520; ;Or in that case, I could select them all and they all would be moved down to the destination pool and would create a single pool.
44; ;00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:13,650; ;But basically, I'm not going to do any of that, I just want to show you how the hybrid works.
45; ;00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:20,390; ;So given these parameters then, I'm going to go ahead and create this pool.
46; ;00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:30,100; ;And we'll take a look at the results for that.
47; ;00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:43,510; ;So in this case, it calculated Unity 400, 4U count, same number of IOPs and the capacities have changed a bit, but the drive count is 47.
48; ;00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:45,060; ;And you can see what it did.
49; ;00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:47,580; ;It used two pools.
50; ;00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:52,430; ;Those pools have LUNs in them with similar characteristics, as we said.
51; ;00:06:52,430 --> 00:07:11,830; ;And you can see that's occupying the space over here, so if I were to look at the pool information, I have a non-busy pool, so LUNs that are classified with similar characteristics are put in that pool and that pool is a RAID 5 for the flash.
52; ;00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:24,540; ;And some SAS RAID 5, and this total of 14 LUNs in that pool, and then in the small random, I have 23 LUNs total based on 200 gigabyte drives.
53; ;00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:35,010; ;And the SAS being 600 gigabyte 15K drives, both RAID 5 configurations, and my 23 drives give me the 47 count.
54; ;00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:41,330; ;And then, of course, you can add CNA connectivity, additional IO modules, etcetera here.
55; ;00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:50,850; ;And here is your pictorial, so we include the OS disk, for as for drives, we include the pool because it's a hybrid, we need hot spares for the respective disk types.
56; ;00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:59,650; ;And we see that created here, of course, because we selected FAST Cache, we have FAST Cache to show up as well.
57; ;00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:10,880; ;And that is the way you can size a hybrid solution using the NAR/MiTrend data.
1; ;00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:05,480; ;We'll look now at the Application Oriented path.
2; ;00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:13,180; ;So this path is going to allow the sizing of various configurations, and it's going to be based on the workloads of those applications.
3; ;00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:22,930; ;So this will provide the user with a bit more granularity control over the workload and data within that particular application.
4; ;00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:30,820; ;It also allows you to define multiple applications and workloads within a single configuration.
5; ;00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:39,580; ;And of course, every workload, depending on what it is, is going to have unique inputs and rules for implementing that particular application.
6; ;00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:46,240; ;That's going to be based on the best practices and the recommendations for the particular system being sized.
7; ;00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:49,680; ;We'll take a look then at the way that we can launch it.
8; ;00:00:49,680 --> 00:01:05,440; ;And just as we did with the other options, we have the Application Oriented path from the menu option here, of course, the icon as well, and they both launch the same page.
9; ;00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:11,860; ;Now by default, you can see that I have some default values already placed in here.
10; ;00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:18,420; ;For example, the Application Type defaults to Microsoft Exchange with a compression ratio of 2.
11; ;00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:37,450; ;And we have some Load Specific Parameters already filled in for us, in this particular case, the Quota for the Mail Box is determined in megabytes and the number of Users and Server Counts, or the actual database availability groups count as well.
12; ;00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:39,740; ;This defaults to All Flash, I can change it.
13; ;00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:47,290; ;And if I do change it, as with the other options, it will ask me to confirm that.
14; ;00:01:47,290 --> 00:01:54,290; ;So if I want to go to a Hybrid option, and back to the Hybrid option.
15; ;00:01:54,290 --> 00:01:58,950; ;Now since I don't have any added workloads, it won't allow me to do that.
16; ;00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:11,000; ;But for example, if I just added a workload, you can see in the workspace over here that that particular workload has been now populated here, and I could view the results.
17; ;00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:19,320; ;I can also delete any workload using the trash can icon here, or I can reset the workload.
18; ;00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:21,550; ;And now let's try to go to the hybrid itself.
19; ;00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:23,600; ;You can see it's going to ask me for confirmation there.
20; ;00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:34,500; ;So once, you know, you have a configuration for a particular type, when you go to change that, you're going to have to answer the confirmation prompt.
21; ;00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:37,750; ;So I'll go back to the All Flash Array.
22; ;00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:49,820; ;We have two ways to reset the form, we have a Reset Form option here on the lower side, which is going to reset all the information found in the configuration details on the left.
23; ;00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:58,990; ;I also have the Reset Workload option here where I can reset the workloads that have populated in the workload here.
24; ;00:02:58,990 --> 00:03:13,080; ;Now you can see here because there aren't any, that option isn't available right now, it has to have a valid workload in the space for that Reset Workload choice to be configured.
25; ;00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,580; ;So let's take an example.
26; ;00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:15,770; ;Here's my Application Type.
27; ;00:03:15,770 --> 00:03:22,200; ;So I have a File Share, again, it defaults to MS Exchange.
28; ;00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,520; ;I do have the File Share.
29; ;00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:31,790; ;And if I want to size that particular application, I would have to define things such as protocols, such as the users.
30; ;00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:41,610; ;And you can see what will change if I do that, then you can see here my Protocol options either being CIFS or NFS and my number of users.
31; ;00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:51,400; ;So you can see that for each unique application that I select, I have varying load specific parameters which I need to fill in.
32; ;00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:54,070; ;You can see that here for the OLTP.
33; ;00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:57,050; ;I could do the same, for example, for VDI.
34; ;00:03:57,050 --> 00:04:09,350; ;And I can have several other options to size that specific application and a number of inputs that it would take for the sizing of that solution.
35; ;00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:12,420; ;So let's take an example, again, I'll go back to the default.
36; ;00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:16,630; ;I can change the name, it's a text name, I can change it to anything I want.
37; ;00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:21,320; ;It does provide you, as you see, a default value.
38; ;00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:24,640; ;In this case, MS Exchange 1.
39; ;00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:37,510; ;The Compression Ratio can be selected because, as noted, we're in an all flash array and that All Flash array is going to allow me that option of compression.
40; ;00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:42,330; ;And I can disable that or I can take the default here at 2, it goes all the way up to 12.
41; ;00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:43,560; ;And you can see that here.
42; ;00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:46,640; ;I think you can even add 12 I guess.
43; ;00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:49,280; ;And so you can change that.
44; ;00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:52,320; ;Again, I'll put it back to the defaults.
45; ;00:04:52,320 --> 00:05:10,220; ;And then the Mail Box for this MS Exchange solution in megabytes, the Quota that you want to have, the size of that particular Mail Box, the groups here that we saw here, the actual copies, the database availability group copies if you would.
46; ;00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:12,910; ;The number of Users and the Server Count.
47; ;00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:18,790; ;I also have Advanced Options which I can go to and it'd give me a whole new set of parameters.
48; ;00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:20,440; ;Let's take a look here.
49; ;00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:30,400; ;If I click on that, I can fine tune this even further for the type of users that are going to be using the system and the number of those users.
50; ;00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:38,100; ;For example, it's based upon default average users, a number of 500.
51; ;00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:50,870; ;But I can change that, if I have maybe 10 heavy users I can input that, maybe I have 2 very heavy users, etcetera in those or you can make those changes here.
52; ;00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:58,680; ;And then I would take those changes once I feel comfortable with my inputs, and I will add that workload.
53; ;00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:06,610; ;And once I add that workload, it's going to go ahead and populate the table over here.
54; ;00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:12,990; ;So in this particular case, I have an application, the name of that application.
55; ;00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:24,270; ;The type of application, and then I can go ahead and click on that to view the results of the sized application given the user inputs, and I'll do that here.
56; ;00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:29,250; ;You can see it simply called for a 350 all-flash array.
57; ;00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:42,970; ;It's a 2U form factor, so it's simply requiring really only 10 disks out of that DPE that we see here over in our configuration, and with an effective capacity of 9.52 terabytes.
58; ;00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:51,510; ;And then it's using, in this example, 800 gigabyte flash 3 drives, it's using 10 of those.
59; ;00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:56,530; ;And if I want to drill down even further to look at that pool information, I could do that.
60; ;00:06:56,530 --> 00:06:57,930; ;So it's created one pool.
61; ;00:06:57,930 --> 00:07:04,670; ;It's given it a default name of an active database pool, ILC0.
62; ;00:07:04,670 --> 00:07:10,770; ;It's using 2.5 inch form factor drives, they are 800 gigabyte flash 3 drives.
63; ;00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:19,390; ;And the default RAID type in this example, because it defaults to 10 drives, it is going to be 8+1 configuration.
64; ;00:07:19,390 --> 00:07:32,520; ;Now remember, this uses dynamic pools, so your drive count for that is going to be minimally for that RAID 5, a drive count of 10.
65; ;00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:40,130; ;And then the other information that pertains to that pool in the compression ratio, etcetera.
66; ;00:07:40,130 --> 00:07:45,180; ;Now if I want to change that, I can edit, and that will launch the System Designer page.
67; ;00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:50,920; ;I can go ahead and edit some of the parameters that I feel I need to if I had to.
68; ;00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:59,680; ;I could save that or I could view a comparative configuration from the competition.
69; ;00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:06,150; ;Now also in that configuration, I would have a capability to change the onboard CNA connectivity.
70; ;00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:09,920; ;And I can do that from the selectable options here.
71; ;00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:21,030; ;For example, if I was doing a Fibre Channel CNA and I have that already persisted as a Fibre Channel CNA, I could select that.
72; ;00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:25,400; ;Optional IO modules if there was any.
73; ;00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:30,580; ;Now you can see here that I can see expansion IO modules.
74; ;00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:42,640; ;Now if you recall, we had a 350 and we know that 350 doesn't support any of the SAS back-end modules, so we don't see any of those available here.
75; ;00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:51,280; ;And then it provides you with an alternate configuration as well and I could view the result of that.
76; ;00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:57,980; ;So that happens to be just be a simple example of an application oriented configuration.
77; ;00:08:57,980 --> 00:09:06,920; ;Now again, if I don't want that, I can go ahead and go back to the application, I can go ahead and delete that workload.
78; ;00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:15,600; ;And I can go ahead and reset the form.
79; ;00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:21,580; ;And now let's just take another quick example maybe for OLTP.
80; ;00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:23,580; ;I'll need the Compression Ratio there.
81; ;00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:31,390; ;You see if I selected Hybrid, that Compression Ratio goes away.
82; ;00:09:31,390 --> 00:09:41,850; ;Transaction Duration, so this again would be, you know, the duration of those particular transactions that you would typically find.
83; ;00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:46,370; ;And then I have other user options, Active Table size in gigabytes.
84; ;00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:56,610; ;And again, clicking on the Advanced Options, I'll have the ability to use Web, Internal, or End User profiles.
85; ;00:09:56,610 --> 00:10:07,260; ;Which will change really just change the ratios for the read-write ratios and some of the IOPS that are going to be used for those particular typical applications.
86; ;00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:09,310; ;And I would do it the same way.
87; ;00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:11,820; ;Let's say I'm just going to have 300.
88; ;00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:16,510; ;Let's say I'll use Web 5.
89; ;00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:18,600; ;And I'll add that here.
90; ;00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:25,480; ;It comes into my workload and I can again view the results.
91; ;00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:30,570; ;And you can see in this case, my pool information has changed a bit because it's created two pools.
92; ;00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:44,370; ;Each one of those pools is going to be configured for a 10 disk pool, hence the total drive count for this particular configuration because of the logs in the database is going to be 20.
93; ;00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:49,900; ;And that shows your configuration down here.
94; ;00:10:49,900 --> 00:11:00,150; ;And you could do that for each one of the applicable, available, I should say, applications that you find here.
95; ;00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:01,950; ;You do have a Free Form option.
96; ;00:11:01,950 --> 00:11:08,220; ;The Free Form option really gives full control to the user.
97; ;00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:13,060; ;This can be used to add any really arbitrary workload to the list.
98; ;00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:16,720; ;And you can see a number of options that you can change here.
99; ;00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:31,090; ;You should probably really have a good idea of what your applications are doing and what your application profile is before you start to use that Free Form choice.
100; ;00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:35,440; ;And you can see that it goes all the way down as well.
101; ;00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:41,710; ;So that is the Application Type path for the Unity Sizer.
1; ;00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:12,010; ;So if you're a certified member of the uSpeak community and you launched the Sizer, you're going to have an option available to you called Advanced Performance.
2; ;00:00:12,010 --> 00:00:20,160; ;And the Advanced Performance is going to allow you to create pools and manually apply a load to the respective pools.
3; ;00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:31,200; ;You could create a single pool and add several loads to that pool or you can create a number of pools, each of which could have its own load applied to it.
4; ;00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:37,160; ;So we'll take a look at how that is done and the information needed to do that.
5; ;00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:42,390; ;So the first thing we do is we go ahead and launch the Advanced Performance path page.
6; ;00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:45,960; ;I can do that from the dashboard as you see here.
7; ;00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:49,010; ;I'm going to just click on that and launch the page.
8; ;00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:53,300; ;And then it brings me up the system information.
9; ;00:00:53,300 --> 00:01:07,400; ;Now I have to fill in each one of these manually, so you need to know a bit about the applications, the benchmark configurations that you have tested or some test information.
10; ;00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:15,950; ;But it does require a bit about the applications and the way they behave, and the size, and workloads, etcetera.
11; ;00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:18,790; ;So the first thing we see is system information.
12; ;00:01:18,790 --> 00:01:23,410; ;We have pool information and we have load information.
13; ;00:01:23,410 --> 00:01:25,360; ;So let's start up with the system information.
14; ;00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:31,740; ;You can see I can select the model number of which I want to size.
15; ;00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:34,910; ;And in this case, I'll do a Unity 350.
16; ;00:01:34,910 --> 00:01:37,040; ;It's an all-flash model.
17; ;00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:50,310; ;It's going to allow you to go ahead and choose from a disk processor, a DAE preference, and it does that in terms of the density and the size of those processor enclosures and array enclosures.
18; ;00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:53,540; ;Now, by default, it uses this Efficient Mix.
19; ;00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:56,720; ;However, you can change it to High Density or Low Density.
20; ;00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:04,040; ;And basically what it's going to do depending on the model it's going to allow you to...
21; ;00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:07,360; ;It doesn't allow you to choose, it allows you to select the preference.
22; ;00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,730; ;However, it's already built-in for you.
23; ;00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:11,720; ;So depending on what you choose.
24; ;00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:24,440; ;For example, the Efficient Mix is going to create three tiers, a different PE processor enclosure or a different array enclosure for each one of those tiers.
25; ;00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:26,840; ;And it's going to do that based on the model number.
26; ;00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:35,250; ;For example, we'll create a 2.5-inch flash drive in 25-drive DAE or DP.
27; ;00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:44,510; ;Whereas if you chose high density, it's going to start off choosing the 80 drive DAE drive that's new with the Unity 4.2 release and a 25 drive DPE.
28; ;00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:58,670; ;So it's really nothing more than choosing the processor enclosures and the array enclosures applicable for that model to fit the best performance requirements for the workload.
29; ;00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:09,030; ;If you have system drives, you can see in this example, system drives are part of this selectable manual input selection because it's an all-flash drive.
30; ;00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:14,540; ;So we don't have FAST Cache, we don't have counter FAST cache, etcetera, so we'll leave those blank.
31; ;00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:17,690; ;The pool information allows you to select a pool name.
32; ;00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:22,030; ;It has a default name that's shown here as Pool-1.
33; ;00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:29,350; ;And then, of course, the other things that you see with the circle and the dash blanked out.
34; ;00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:33,640; ;You do have a compression ratio you can select from the available options.
35; ;00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:44,170; ;If you know the compression ratio, it defaults at 2 to 1, and then it comes down to the various tiers.
36; ;00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:53,740; ;Now in this case, because it's a 350, I have a flash gear consisting of 10 400gb SAS Flash 3 drives.
37; ;00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:57,280; ;The RAID type chosen for that by default is RAID 5.
38; ;00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:06,170; ;It's selectable, and the RAID count and the RAID width are chosen by default, now being 4.2.
39; ;00:04:06,170 --> 00:04:16,170; ;The RAID width isn't going to be allowed to be changed, at least to this size and also the GUI.
40; ;00:04:16,170 --> 00:04:21,240; ;So you'd have to do that through UEMCLI, which you can see the minimum drive count here is 10.
41; ;00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:29,520; ;You can click on the icon and attempt to change the RAID width, but it will tell you it can't be done.
42; ;00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:35,150; ;It needs to really be done through the UEMCLI commands.
43; ;00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:40,780; ;So once we do that, we're going to go ahead and just...
44; ;00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:42,580; ;If you want to change the drive count, you can.
45; ;00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:51,360; ;You can do that to 25, etcetera, but I'm going to go back and just take the defaults here for now.
46; ;00:04:51,360 --> 00:05:00,070; ;Now here's your tier capacity based on the input of the Flash drives and the size of the drives.
47; ;00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:07,730; ;The load information, you enter, you enter a load name, again, changeable, make it something that makes sense to you.
48; ;00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:11,820; ;The tiering policy is not applicable for a flash drive because everything is on the FAST tier.
49; ;00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:27,400; ;However, if it was a hybrid, of course, we can go ahead and use the dropdown and select from the highest to the lowest in the auto tier, which is the default where hard data will be moved up automatically to the highest performance tier.
50; ;00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,390; ;LUN count is selectable.
51; ;00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:32,580; ;The threads per LUN is selectable and it defaults at 32.
52; ;00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:40,250; ;So if you have additional information, you know something about the thread count per LUN, you want to change that, you can do that here.
53; ;00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:43,890; ;And then we have the application workloads.
54; ;00:05:43,890 --> 00:05:46,890; ;So the application workloads are selectable as well.
55; ;00:05:46,890 --> 00:05:50,800; ;For example, you can change that to Exchange.
56; ;00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,840; ;The read size in this case defaults to 32 KB.
57; ;00:05:53,840 --> 00:06:03,290; ;And then the random read, sequential read, percentage, these are all percentages of what the categories are, random read percentage.
58; ;00:06:03,290 --> 00:06:10,280; ;So unless you had some baseline and some information about that, you can just take the defaults.
59; ;00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:16,930; ;Otherwise, you could put in if you know some details about your application.
60; ;00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:19,050; ;The skew rate defaults to 90%.
61; ;00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:25,660; ;So 90% of that IO would be done at 10% of the disk capacity.
62; ;00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:31,610; ;And then the host IOPS is what's going to be used to configure a lot of these calculations.
63; ;00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:38,230; ;And so we're going to base these calculations and we'll be able do that with a number of modes we'll see down here.
64; ;00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:52,350; ;And these modes basically Compute, Solve, Rule of Thumb, Solve Max, and then I can actually get a graphic of those outputs.
65; ;00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:58,640; ;So for the host IOPS, this is what's going to be used.
66; ;00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:00,960; ;For example, I have a 350 here now.
67; ;00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,020; ;Let's take a look at this.
68; ;00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:11,410; ;If I put in say 40,000 or 40K.
69; ;00:07:11,410 --> 00:07:30,110; ;We have a choice here that is labeled Find Best Fit for Max IOPS, and that Find Best Fit for Max IOPS is going to go out and try to size for the most efficient solution for that host IOP rate.
70; ;00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:35,990; ;So we took that 40K as an input and it will update the drive count and everything necessary for that.
71; ;00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:42,150; ;But I want you to notice something, what happens here, 'cause it's not easy to see.
72; ;00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:56,400; ;When I find the best fit for IOPS, it's going to base this on percentage, 70% of SP saturation, dry saturation, and actually the response time max as well.
73; ;00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,570; ;So let's take a look and see how this works.
74; ;00:07:58,570 --> 00:08:02,660; ;And you'll see up here 'cause this is what's going to change the system model.
75; ;00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:10,740; ;If I do this Best Fit for IOPS, given the number of IOPS I input, the system went out and said,
76; ;00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:20,110; ;"Wait a minute, this is 40K IOPS you're trying to input here on the F350, you're actually going to need a 650F to satisfy that requirement."
77; ;00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:29,880; ;And if you do, that will fall within the 70% over here that you see for the drive utilization percentage and the system saturation percentage.
78; ;00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:40,760; ;So you need to watch that if you really want to size a 350, otherwise you're going to be putting in information about a 650.
79; ;00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:44,050; ;So I'm going to just go back to a 350 in a case like that.
80; ;00:08:44,050 --> 00:08:58,070; ;Now if I did something different, if I went in and go ahead and try to base this based on rule of thumbs for that 40K, it will go ahead and calculate that as well.
81; ;00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:17,510; ;And what you can see is that my host IOPS which was originally 40K, it went and throttled that down based on the rule of thumbs for that system at just about 15K here, 14,781.
82; ;00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:26,890; ;And you see the utilization, of course, is down for the drive wise, but the system saturation is still up at around 85%.
83; ;00:09:26,890 --> 00:09:32,250; ;So it really depends on how you use these and how these figures are calculated.
84; ;00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:42,140; ;If I did the same for the Solve Max, I can see that the host IOPS again changed as did my percentages.
85; ;00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:54,250; ;If I do that, my system saturation the way it figures this out is, you know, at 100%, so it's right around 99.9% saturation right now.
86; ;00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:58,950; ;That's the most I could go on that particular system.
87; ;00:09:58,950 --> 00:10:08,600; ;And then I could go ahead and use the Compute option as well, which if I go ahead and select that, it will go ahead and compute those and configure those values as well.
88; ;00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:14,270; ;In this case, it went up around a little more than 17K.
89; ;00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:24,640; ;So I'm going to base this calculation on the Solve Rule of Thumb, I'm going to use 14,781 host IOPS.
90; ;00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:32,490; ;Now once I configured the pool and the load, I am going to have to add that to the pool list.
91; ;00:10:32,490 --> 00:10:38,720; ;When I do that, it's automatically going to apply the load that I configured for that pool to the list as well.
92; ;00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,950; ;So let's do that, let's add the pool.
93; ;00:10:41,950 --> 00:10:43,710; ;You can see that it added the pool.
94; ;00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:45,310; ;This is pool 1.
95; ;00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:48,490; ;And load 1 is applied to that pool.
96; ;00:10:48,490 --> 00:10:51,270; ;And I can delete that with the trashcan.
97; ;00:10:51,270 --> 00:11:01,210; ;Now if I what to change or add another load, I could simply change my load information here.
98; ;00:11:01,210 --> 00:11:05,540; ;Let's say I want to do OLTP in this case, that would change all this information.
99; ;00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:10,020; ;And what I would do is go ahead and add that load to the pool.
100; ;00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:15,470; ;So in that example, I would have two loads applied to pool 1.
101; ;00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:29,260; ;Or I can always start with this pool and create additional load for pool number two as well.
102; ;00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:32,220; ;So I'm going to take that.
103; ;00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:38,810; ;It's still calculating a Unity 350F.
104; ;00:11:38,810 --> 00:11:43,920; ;And since I had that information, I'm going to go ahead and see what I can do with more results.
105; ;00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:52,240; ;And now could see down here in the pool members to satisfy that requirement, all those IOPS, of course, are going to come from the flash tier.
106; ;00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,300; ;And that's what it's telling me here.
107; ;00:11:54,300 --> 00:12:04,850; ;So if I look at the results, you'll see in this case, for that particular host IO load that I applied, the Unity 350 is going to fit.
108; ;00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:15,660; ;It's 2U, it's still going to be 10 drives total, but the system saturation is at about 85%.
109; ;00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:18,240; ;And that's how you can use that information there.
110; ;00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:30,110; ;Now if you want to add an onboard CNA card, you could do that or maybe you have an optional IO card that you want to add, you can certainly do that as well.
111; ;00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:48,570; ;And then you can do the normal things that we showed you before where you can export that to a MyQuotes or PDF file or you can edit with the System Designer, save the information, and then view a competitor's array against your current configuration.
112; ;00:12:48,570 --> 00:12:52,370; ;So I'm going to go back to the Advanced Performance.
113; ;00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:55,600; ;And you can see what's figured over here.
114; ;00:12:55,600 --> 00:13:08,630; ;The system metrics that are used, I see my system throughput is going to be the host IO numbers that I put in and the system utilization.
115; ;00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:12,460; ;So let's just add another pool just for the heck of it.
116; ;00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:21,120; ;Let's add a 20,000 if we can to the application workload.
117; ;00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,210; ;And that's all I'm going to add.
118; ;00:13:22,210 --> 00:13:30,500; ;Just to show you how this is done, then I can add that load and you can see that load then is applied on pool 1 as well.
119; ;00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:32,480; ;And you can see the other things have changed too.
120; ;00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:41,830; ;My throughput, of course, my saturation now is up to 90%, so I should be able to view that as well with the View Results.
121; ;00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:56,050; ;And one last thing that you can do, of course, dynamic pools or I should say Unity 4.2 in general doesn't use hot spares, as you know...
122; ;00:13:56,050 --> 00:14:08,730; ;That was on prior systems on the Unity 300, 400, 500, and the F series before 4.2 that used traditional pools.
123; ;00:14:08,730 --> 00:14:10,900; ;However, you can add additional drives.
124; ;00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:17,280; ;And if you add additional drives to a 4.2 system, these can still be used as hot spares.
125; ;00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:27,480; ;So if you did encounter a failure of a drive within the pool, it will go out and search for that and you can add that as a hot spare as well.
126; ;00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:31,680; ;So if I wanted to do that, I can add extra unused drives to the system.
127; ;00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:36,400; ;Of course, these are unused, so it doesn't add anything in terms of capacity.
128; ;00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:46,900; ;And I can select that now because I have a pool consisting of 400 SAS flash 3 drives, that's going to be my only choice.
129; ;00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:51,080; ;So I would enter that, and then I would enter count by simply highlighting the Enter Count.
130; ;00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:56,990; ;Let's say I want to add another five unused drives, and I'll just add it down there.
131; ;00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:03,430; ;And you can remove them the same way.
132; ;00:15:03,430 --> 00:15:09,850; ;Or you can go ahead and again add some other drives.
133; ;00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:20,720; ;So again, this is the way that depending on how you want to compute the values, it's all done through the various algorithms as determined by the tool itself.
134; ;00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:30,140; ;Refer to the Help page to get those details as to some of the intricacies of how this works and what the values are based on.
135; ;00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:33,570; ;But it's really based on best practices.
136; ;00:15:33,570 --> 00:15:37,440; ;And that's basically what they use.
137; ;00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:41,700; ;So that is the Advance Performance path.
1; ;00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,230; ;This concludes the Unity systems administration training.
2; ;00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:10,130; ;We covered the different management and monitoring user interfaces and the Unity access control.
3; ;00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:16,200; ;We also covered the event notifications and alerts used for identifying system issues.
4; ;00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:18,200; ;So what's next?
5; ;00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:24,460; ;If you plan on taking the certification exam, you should take each one of the trainings provided in the learning center.
6; ;00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:30,660; ;Please also remember to download all the student resource guides, for a full set of study materials.
7; ;00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:36,730; ;Additionally the learning center provides access to a practice exam to further help you prepare.
8; ;00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:41,860; ;Thanks for taking the training, and good luck.
1; ;00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,230; ;Welcome to the Unity Storage Provisioning training.
2; ;00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:09,460; ;My name is Carlos Leite and I will be the instructor for this section of the course.
3; ;00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:15,130; ;In this section, I will be covering the provisioning of block source resources for Xen hosts.
4; ;00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:18,700; ;And file source resources for NAS clients.
5; ;00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:27,800; ;This section also covers how to provision VMWare, VMFS, NFS and [inaudible] to the SXR hosts.
6; ;00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:33,860; ;You will notice that the topics in this section have been broken into small chunks for consumption.
7; ;00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:45,330; ;As these topics are consumed, please keep in mind which aspects of storage provisioning can influence a system design for performance, capacity and resilience.
8; ;00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:48,900; ;Some features will provide storage capacity efficiency.

7; ;00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:58,880; ;This lesson covers the Compression Feature on supported Block resources.
8; ;00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:10,060; ;This concludes this section of the Advanced Storage Feature section.

2; ;00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:24,220; ;The lesson discusses the use cases for the co-creation of multi-tenancy in the Unity systems, how tenants are associated with NAS servers, and how network segments can be isolated with the use of VLAN tagging.
3; ;00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:30,560; ;The steps to implement IP multi-tenancy on a Unity System, are also covered.

15; ;00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:36,140; ;Know that Unity Compression is supported on both Block and File Storage resources.
16; ;00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:40,920; ;This lesson covers the Compression feature on supported File resources.
17; ;00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:50,020; ;And this concludes this section of the training.

3; ;00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:26,860; ;This completes the presentation.
1; ;00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:13,300; ;In this first lesson, we'll look at the Unity Sizer overview and some design considerations when using the Unity Sizer.
2; ;00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:28,600; ;In this lesson, we'll look at the Unity Sizer flash recommendations and guidelines when using the Sizer.
3; ;00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:42,680; ;There are some recommendations put forth by Dell EMC for the use of Flash drives in the Unity system and when you size the system.
4; ;00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:51,410; ;In this lesson, we'll get the Unity Sizer menu options.
5; ;00:00:56,650 --> 00:00:59,330; ;Here is an example of the homepage.
6; ;00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:06,070; ;And from that homepage, we're going to select the first option or the first path, and it's is going to be the System Designer path.
7; ;00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:21,710; ;The Simple Performance path allows the sizing of applications with a minimal input at very early stages in the design.
8; ;00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:29,530; ;In other words, before you have complete workload details for the system you want to configure.
9; ;00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:33,340; ;So this method does provide a prediction.
10; ;00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:39,390; ;And it predicts the decay of data access over a time-based period based on those inputs.
11; ;00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:56,400; ;It computes a skew value, it determines how to best build a pool to efficiently capture the data, and it determines the IOP rate achievable based on the drives being no more than 70% busy.
12; ;00:01:56,400 --> 00:02:03,990; ;So the first thing that we would do is we would go ahead and select an All-Flash Array hybrid type.
13; ;00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:12,740; ;Remember again, just like all the other screens, if you choose to change from the default, you're going to have to go ahead and reset the configuration.
14; ;00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:17,200; ;And then you have a number of options starting with the Application Details.
15; ;00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:20,560; ;So the Application Details is going to be a dropdown.
16; ;00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:30,540; ;That dropdown is going to allow you to specify the type of workload that you're going to have as input to the system along with a compression rate.
17; ;00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:33,200; ;And of course, you can provide this a name as well.
18; ;00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:45,630; ;So you do have a small read-write mix, you have a medium read-write mix, and you have a small read heavy mix of which you can choose from the dropdown.
19; ;00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:59,180; ;And those will change the amounts of the read-write ratios along with the IO size that you're going to use for that particular application, either 8K or 64Kb.
20; ;00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:09,260; ;The Load Specific Parameters values, you're gonna provide a few values here, you're gonna have an initial capacity.
21; ;00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:18,630; ;This is going to be what the capacity initially is going to be in terabytes on the day you plan to deploy the system.
22; ;00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:20,520; ;You have the yearly growth rate.
23; ;00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:32,970; ;You can specify a percentage of the estimated average annual capacity growth that you're going to expect over a period of time.
24; ;00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:34,840; ;You also have the Days Hot option.
25; ;00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:43,280; ;And this is going to be the estimated duration that newly created data which stays highly accessed would be available.
26; ;00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:50,480; ;The default value for that is 45 days, but again, it's an arbitrary value, you can set it to anything you like.
27; ;00:03:50,480 --> 00:04:06,890; ;Just be aware that longer durations mean that the data appears more over the total configuration for the days that it is hot, whereas shorter durations means the access is going to be a little more concentrated and has a higher skew.
28; ;00:04:06,890 --> 00:04:15,770; ;So we would expect to see a better skew with a lower duration of that parameter.
29; ;00:04:15,770 --> 00:04:17,940; ;And then you have the target's IOP.
30; ;00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:23,340; ;This is going to be the rate to which the current workload has to align to.
31; ;00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:26,670; ;Now you do have some optional advanced options.
32; ;00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:39,180; ;And this section is going to basically allow you to go in and change the default values at every tier if you're on a hybrid array now.
33; ;00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:41,700; ;If you're on an all-flash array, you're only going to have one tier.
34; ;00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:50,440; ;So here we see an example.
35; ;00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:59,650; ;The example is shown for a Unity 450 Flash for a simple performance View Results option.
36; ;00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:07,580; ;You can see that it is a sizer system with a capacity of 61.12 terabytes in a 14U cabinet.
37; ;00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:14,070; ;And the required IOPS for that solution based on the input was 71,232.
38; ;00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:19,140; ;And then it also shows us an image, in this case, for all the pool information.
39; ;00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:31,430; ;So this particular pool was built using 400 gb flash 3 drives and it used a total of 168 for that.
40; ;00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:41,270; ;And you can see the labels of those pools being the small read heavy with an in-line compression enabled.
41; ;00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:52,930; ;Another option within the dashboard in the paths is the Competitive Storage Solutions option.
42; ;00:05:52,930 --> 00:06:00,650; ;So the Sizer is going to provide a method for comparing the Dell EMC storage solutions against the competition's offerings.
43; ;00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:06,080; ;In this example, we've sized up a Unity 550.
44; ;00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:13,450; ;And to view the competitor's storage solutions, we need to click on the Competitive tab.
45; ;00:06:13,450 --> 00:06:16,460; ;Now the Competitor's window is going to be displayed.
46; ;00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:23,730; ;And if there are solutions that are similar, they're going to be shown in the upper left-hand corner.
47; ;00:06:23,730 --> 00:06:29,530; ;Now in this example, we see both a NetApp and a pure being compared against a system.
48; ;00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:38,750; ;And if I were to click on either one of those, I would display the competitive information such as the specification comparisons.
49; ;00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:51,660; ;How they are positioned, what the pricing is on that, and some of the fun facts that can be of value when you're talking to the customer so you know the difference and how to position the Unity against the competition.
50; ;00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:57,860; ;Now if the model isn't shown, you can go ahead and use the dropdown feature to select a vendor in the model.
51; ;00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:01,130; ;And then you can go ahead and submit that as well.
52; ;00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:07,320; ;So here we see an example of sizing in looking at the competitive option.
53; ;00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:16,110; ;We see a NetApp FAS8000 has been sized and is a competitor.
54; ;00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:21,290; ;So by the fact that I click on that, it brings me up the information you see here on the screen.
55; ;00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:27,030; ;And this is going to provide an overview of what NetApp model can do.
56; ;00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:45,540; ;It's going to show you some positioning information on there as well, some pricing architecture, so a lot of good information, and also some links where you can even further access some of the competitive intelligence, wiki information, and pricing tools from Dell EMC.
1; ;00:00:00,850 --> 00:00:06,980; ;We'll take a look at the Unity Sizer, specifically the System Designer path.
2; ;00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:11,300; ;I've logged on to the Unity Sizer, I'm on the homepage.
3; ;00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:13,620; ;The first option is the System Designer.
4; ;00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:21,710; ;I can select that option from here or I can come to the option that is shown here, where I can choose this path as well.
5; ;00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:26,500; ;Either way, it's going to bring me to the same path.
6; ;00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:32,330; ;This is going to allow me to manually create a configuration based upon the drive selection.
7; ;00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:49,670; ;I can also move down, and you can see that for this particular model, 450, 550, 650, etcetera, I have the capacities, and I have the usable capacities.
8; ;00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:54,610; ;This is what I can configure here as maximum for these.
9; ;00:00:54,610 --> 00:00:58,390; ;I'm going to take a look and view the results just to show you an example.
10; ;00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:07,690; ;If I were to use the Quick Configuration, I can see that the 500F is going to have a raw capacity.
11; ;00:01:07,690 --> 00:01:11,560; ;This shows me the IOPS I can do.
12; ;00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:14,690; ;The usable capacity, effective capacity.
13; ;00:01:14,690 --> 00:01:20,130; ;I can hover over each one of these and it shows me how that is figured out.
14; ;00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:24,790; ;Total Drive Count of 10, my workload, my block size are the default values.
15; ;00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:37,710; ;I can see that in this example of 1.6 terabyte flash 3 drives, it starts off with a drive count of 10, gives me these capacities.
16; ;00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:43,760; ;And then of course, it's an all-flash drive, so this is not applicable here for fast cache.
17; ;00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:47,190; ;I could edit that, I can save that configuration.
18; ;00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:50,520; ;I could view our competitor's information as well.
19; ;00:01:51,600 --> 00:02:05,820; ;I can also choose the converged network adapter connectivity options if I were to go ahead and take a look at what I can do for the CNA ports as well as any additional IOs.
20; ;00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:12,800; ;Then you can see that, of course, I can't select anything here because I haven't selected something here yet.
21; ;00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,300; ;Once I do that, you'll see these options are available.
22; ;00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:18,370; ;That's typically how this menu is going to work.
23; ;00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:26,740; ;You have to select the first option here before you can use the additional options, so you need to work left to right.
24; ;00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:30,780; ;It will also display an alternate configuration as well.
25; ;00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:36,660; ;Let's go back to the home page.
26; ;00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:40,040; ;I'm going to select the System Designer.
27; ;00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:49,660; ;You can see that I have model numbers available to me if there are more that can be displayed.
28; ;00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:53,680; ;I can view those by going to the right arrow, clicking on that.
29; ;00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:58,850; ;I can go all the way up to the 600F because you see here the all-flash is the default.
30; ;00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:02,150; ;I'll go back again.
31; ;00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:06,630; ;None of this information is filled in, I need to do that, I'm going to do that now.
32; ;00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:08,640; ;I'm going to select a 550.
33; ;00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:13,480; ;Once I do that, it gives me the maximum drive count limit.
34; ;00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:25,040; ;I can go ahead and use additional information on that if I would just want to configure this privately and look at some available options.
35; ;00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:27,880; ;I'll just go back here and do it this way.
36; ;00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:36,750; ;My workload is going to be defaulted at 80 read and 20 write and the block size at 8K.
37; ;00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:40,070; ;I can change that by using the dropdowns.
38; ;00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:42,690; ;You can see the available options here.
39; ;00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:47,280; ;You select your workload information here and the block size here.
40; ;00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,320; ;You have two choices, 8K or 32K.
41; ;00:03:50,320 --> 00:04:00,410; ;For my pool information, I need to provide a name, and then I can choose a color I want that pool to appear when I put it in the cabinet display over here.
42; ;00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:02,250; ;These are my options here.
43; ;00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:06,410; ;Let's just change that just to give you an example.
44; ;00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:17,620; ;I'll make a Unity 550F and I'll call that Pool 1.
45; ;00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:20,000; ;I'm supplying a name.
46; ;00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:30,520; ;As we saw earlier, I need to start filling this information out left, starting with the drive type, to right finishing it with the RAID width.
47; ;00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:33,960; ;You see here, it's blocked out.
48; ;00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:38,260; ;I can't use those selections until I select the drive type.
49; ;00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:39,800; ;So let's do that.
50; ;00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:43,670; ;I'll select the 1.6 terabyte SAS 3.
51; ;00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:46,810; ;Once I do that, I'll have a RAID type.
52; ;00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:54,710; ;In this configuration, I have three choices we support with the Unity 4.2, I'll select 5.
53; ;00:04:54,710 --> 00:05:03,590; ;Then it automatically fills in the drive count, which I can change all the way up to the number of drives.
54; ;00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:08,540; ;Of course, it's going to be some [guide trees] here.
55; ;00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:13,710; ;Then the RAID width is already filled out as well, the RAID width here is nine drives, eight plus one.
56; ;00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:26,020; ;So now with dynamic pools in the Unity 4.2, it's always going to select a RAID width plus one configuration because I need a hot spare in here as well.
57; ;00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:27,030; ;Now here...
58; ;00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:41,910; ;We'll call them hot spares, we simply call them spare drive to hold what used to be a traditional hybrid pool, a hot spare prior to 4.2.
59; ;00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:52,300; ;I see the RAID width, I can change that, but you note here, if I try to change it, it says "The Unisphere GUI doesn't support the changing of the RAID width."
60; ;00:05:53,860 --> 00:06:00,040; ;If I try to do that, it can only be changed with REST API or the UEMCLI.
61; ;00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:04,280; ;I'm going to go back to the plus one.
62; ;00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:10,480; ;The compression ratio, it shown for me here, I can change that.
63; ;00:06:11,730 --> 00:06:12,790; ;You see what I've done here.
64; ;00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:14,960; ;I can change it all the way up to available options.
65; ;00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,820; ;I'm going to leave it at two plus one.
66; ;00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:24,530; ;It will affect the way the IOPS are going to be displayed here and the way the system will be configured.
67; ;00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:30,450; ;I will have to take a look at that and you'll have to be aware of that when you go through this process.
68; ;00:06:30,450 --> 00:06:34,700; ;Once I select all my options, you can see down here...
69; ;00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:37,760; ;I have the drive information.
70; ;00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:39,790; ;I'm going to go ahead and add this to the pool.
71; ;00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:54,460; ;You see my pool, it was a 550, this is the name of the pool I gave it, and then the number of drives I'm going to use in the capacity, usable capacity along with the effective capacity.
72; ;00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:59,830; ;Then I can go ahead and select View Result.
73; ;00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:04,720; ;This is my information here.
74; ;00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:09,390; ;It gives me all the information that I've entered.
75; ;00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:23,920; ;It computes this information and it's going to go ahead and do a performance prediction, it's going to compute the maximum number of IOPS, it's going to go ahead and consider the maximum platform IOPS capabilities.
76; ;00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:28,440; ;It's going to report which one of these is lower actually.
77; ;00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:31,460; ;You see all the information.
78; ;00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:34,070; ;I can go to pool information.
79; ;00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:50,190; ;My pool list is my first pool, is the form factors of the drives, they're 2.5 inch drives, and the size that I selected along with the RAID type, the count, and a capacity ratio.
80; ;00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:54,230; ;I can go ahead and do the same thing with power.
81; ;00:07:54,230 --> 00:08:01,720; ;This is an early rev of these sizes, so that's coming soon along with some additional information.
82; ;00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:17,350; ;I can go ahead and save this and I can view the competition's arrays as well that stacks up against this particular 550 model.
83; ;00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:25,970; ;Down here, I also have the options of configuring onboard converged network adapter connectivity, and additional IOs.
84; ;00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:35,090; ;Now again, you'll see here if I go to Additional IO, I can't select anything here because I haven't filled in any onboard CNA connectivity yet.
85; ;00:08:36,130 --> 00:08:42,230; ;Let's say I went to a 8, an 8 gig Fibre Channel SFP.
86; ;00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:49,260; ;I can then go down and take a look at additional options here and here as well.
87; ;00:08:49,260 --> 00:09:00,540; ;So some models, as you know, are going to be able to support additional SAS back-ends, particularly the high-end models 500, 600, so you have those options available as well.
88; ;00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:06,890; ;I can go ahead and export this configuration or I can save the configuration.
89; ;00:09:06,890 --> 00:09:10,040; ;If I save it, I'll be asked for a name...
90; ;00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:15,210; ;And a project.
91; ;00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:18,030; ;If I have other projects out there, I can go ahead and browse those projects.
92; ;00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:20,890; ;I don't, so I'm not going to do that.
93; ;00:09:20,890 --> 00:09:22,300; ;That is the information.
94; ;00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:26,930; ;Once you save that, you'll have that project name and you could view those projects at a later time.
95; ;00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:35,140; ;At this point, I've gone ahead and created that based on my user input.
96; ;00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:39,850; ;That concludes the System Designer demo.
1; ;00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:09,680; ;Yet another option I have available from the Unity Sizer menu dashboard is the Quick Configuration options.
2; ;00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:13,100; ;This is a set of predefined configurations.
3; ;00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:21,180; ;They're build to suit multiple number and various number of use cases to fit various profiles.
4; ;00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:31,750; ;I can select these configurations to meet certain IO loads, workloads, etcetera or I can tailor these as well as we'll see with the System Designer.
5; ;00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:40,760; ;I can either click on the Quick Configuration option here as shown in the menu, or I can click on it here as well.
6; ;00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:45,550; ;You can see what these are going to be derived from.
7; ;00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:51,790; ;They are recommended configurations based on IOPS in capacity.
8; ;00:00:51,790 --> 00:01:00,300; ;We're trying to determine suitable number of IOPS and capacity to fit a particular workload given the user input.
9; ;00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:02,400; ;And again, these are predefined.
10; ;00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:05,370; ;So I'm going to go ahead and view all these configurations.
11; ;00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:26,600; ;What I can see is that I have all-flash arrays selected, and it starts here with all-flash arrays.
12; ;00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:29,340; ;And it has a number of them shown.
13; ;00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:34,810; ;In fact, it has 451 of these out of 902 possibilities.
14; ;00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:49,010; ;They're going to be shown to meet the criteria as shown here on the left-hand side for capacity, for IOPS, for compression, the system models that I want to look at.
15; ;00:01:49,010 --> 00:01:56,960; ;The RAID type and the workload, you see here it's defaulted at 8020 in a 8K block size.
16; ;00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,930; ;Then I can even filter it down to a drive type.
17; ;00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:05,320; ;So you can think of this as more or less your input, you can filter these.
18; ;00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:19,500; ;For example, if I were to search for, look for configurations that suit this criteria for capacity of 200 terabytes to 800, I would be able to go ahead and select these.
19; ;00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:34,340; ;You can see up here now, I'm only going to show 24 of the possible 902 that were available based on, again, my input and my selections, my filtering, if you would, in this site.
20; ;00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:35,430; ;I'll close that up.
21; ;00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:38,890; ;I'm just going to take the default and see what we come up with.
22; ;00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:41,440; ;And again, we have 451 of these.
23; ;00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:45,430; ;Here I can go ahead and sort even further by capacity.
24; ;00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:49,820; ;And if I use the dropdown, I have options available.
25; ;00:02:49,820 --> 00:03:01,080; ;The capacity, low to high, high to low, IOPS, the same, or I can view most popular configurations or even the most viewed configurations.
26; ;00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:09,320; ;So in this, the most viewed configurations are the Unity 50 series.
27; ;00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:11,570; ;I could see those shown here.
28; ;00:03:11,570 --> 00:03:19,630; ;It sizes these based on that criteria, raw capacity.
29; ;00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:28,430; ;Usable capacity, effective capacity, and then the number of IOPS based on the drive type.
30; ;00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:38,260; ;You can see down here to fit the bill for that particular configuration, I needed a total number of 17 drives.
31; ;00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:47,490; ;If I want to choose to reset all my options, my filtering options, I can do that here and I can reset that here.
32; ;00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:54,160; ;And it will go back and show me the original 451.
33; ;00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:56,640; ;You'll see the differences here.
34; ;00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:59,480; ;So again, let's take an example.
35; ;00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:18,240; ;Let's say I want to choose a Unity 550, a capacity of 6.18 terabytes and a usable capacity of 3.41, effective capacity 6.82, and then the IOPS based on 400 gigabytes SAS Flash 3 drives.
36; ;00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:26,000; ;This is going to give me a total, build this with a total of 17 drives in a RAID 6 14+2 configuration.
37; ;00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:37,430; ;This is a 550 series, that 550 series as you know is based on Unity version 4.2 which uses dynamic pools.
38; ;00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:45,360; ;When I select a particular number of drives as you saw in your training, it's automatically going to select that RAID width for you.
39; ;00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,980; ;And that's what they've done here.
40; ;00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:59,860; ;So being this is over 14 drives, I'm going to go ahead and automatically use the best results for that, and that is a 14+2.
41; ;00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:02,140; ;So let's take a look.
42; ;00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:04,150; ;I clicked on the View Results.
43; ;00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:07,660; ;It gives me the information here.
44; ;00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:17,300; ;It shows me really the information that we already saw upfront based on the 80:20 ratio for the workload and in 8K block size.
45; ;00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:23,740; ;It's chosen 17 SAS Flash 3 drives.
46; ;00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:29,260; ;And of course, being a flash drive, flash cache doesn't come into play here.
47; ;00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:33,230; ;It's put over here my pool options.
48; ;00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:40,990; ;At that point, I can select the CNA connectivity that I have in want for the system.
49; ;00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:51,250; ;Of course, all that connectivity in the front-end is going to be figured as well into the performance, into the performance of this particular system.
50; ;00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:56,650; ;If I were to go ahead and select that.
51; ;00:05:56,650 --> 00:06:01,130; ;In this case, I selected a 16 gigabit Fibre Channel SFP.
52; ;00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:06,500; ;For the onboard, I can go ahead and add additional modules.
53; ;00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:13,940; ;Let's say I want to take a four port 1 gig baseT.
54; ;00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:16,280; ;You see the several options I have here.
55; ;00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:28,150; ;In fact, I think I'll just go to a 10 baseT just for better throughput.
56; ;00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:31,240; ;Then again, I have an optional one as well.
57; ;00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:36,830; ;Of course, these systems can take, you know, up to a couple IO modules.
58; ;00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:42,380; ;You also saw here the addition of a 12 gigabit per second SAS back-end bus.
59; ;00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:48,550; ;Well, this being a 550 is going to support that as does the 600 and the 650 models as well.
60; ;00:06:48,550 --> 00:07:01,230; ;The high end Unity models will support that additional IO module to extend the back-end bus numbers for that particular model.
61; ;00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:08,050; ;I'm going to go ahead and select that as well.
62; ;00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:15,090; ;Given that criteria, they'll come up with an alternate configuration as well.
63; ;00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:16,560; ;I could view the results of that.
64; ;00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:20,610; ;That's true for each one of the models you select.
65; ;00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:24,310; ;Other information here of course is about the pool.
66; ;00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:26,190; ;This is Pool 1, that's the default name.
67; ;00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:36,230; ;You could change that name if you choose based upon the SAS Flash 3 drives and the RAID configuration and the information here.
68; ;00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:43,270; ;If I want to change that info, I can do that with the Edit System Designer.
69; ;00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:50,470; ;I can't save this configuration, I'll be asked to save it as a PDF or a XML for MyQuotes.
70; ;00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:56,970; ;I can also view the competition's, competitor's offerings against these particular products.
71; ;00:07:56,970 --> 00:08:01,420; ;And we'll take a look at that a bit later.
72; ;00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:02,680; ;Let's see what I can do with this.
73; ;00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:09,650; ;Once I've selected and I'm happy with that information, power information again is not available to you.
74; ;00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:17,480; ;The additional information gives you information about the version of sizer and the flash percentage in the system drive tier.
75; ;00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:23,290; ;Of course, since it is all-flash, it's going to be extreme performance tier.
76; ;00:08:23,290 --> 00:08:24,930; ;Let's go ahead and export.
77; ;00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:33,620; ;When I export it, it's going to ask me to export it and it has defaults as MyQuotes, XML, or PDF, I would have to give that a name.
78; ;00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:39,260; ;I could do that here.
79; ;00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:42,320; ;If I wanted to describe that, I could do that here as well.
80; ;00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:48,120; ;Then I would just, let's say, I want to export that as simply a PDF file.
81; ;00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:52,420; ;In order for me to do that, if you haven't already saved it, it's going to ask you to save it.
82; ;00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:54,540; ;I'm going to go ahead and do that.
83; ;00:08:54,540 --> 00:09:02,070; ;I'll save it as a project name, number one.
84; ;00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:04,550; ;You see it saves it in the project's name here.
85; ;00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:07,410; ;Now it goes in the process of exporting that.
86; ;00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:20,660; ;I can open that, I can choose to do that here, and it will give me the information, cabinet layouts, and I can view all that information in a PDF format.
87; ;00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:32,070; ;Also, down here where I looked at Saved Configurations, it would be part of that saved configurations list in case I want to list those and choose those again.
88; ;00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:44,170; ;That is the options available for you and an example of the Quick Configuration options and how to use that Quick Configuration menu from the Unity Sizer.
1; ;00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:09,680; ;Yet another option I have available from the Unity Sizer menu dashboard is the Quick Configuration options.
2; ;00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:13,100; ;This is a set of predefined configurations.
3; ;00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:21,180; ;They're build to suit multiple number and various number of use cases to fit various profiles.
4; ;00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:31,750; ;I can select these configurations to meet certain IO loads, workloads, etcetera or I can tailor these as well as we'll see with the System Designer.
5; ;00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:40,760; ;I can either click on the Quick Configuration option here as shown in the menu, or I can click on it here as well.
6; ;00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:45,550; ;You can see what these are going to be derived from.
7; ;00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:51,790; ;They are recommended configurations based on IOPS in capacity.
8; ;00:00:51,790 --> 00:01:00,300; ;We're trying to determine suitable number of IOPS and capacity to fit a particular workload given the user input.
9; ;00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:02,400; ;And again, these are predefined.
10; ;00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:05,370; ;So I'm going to go ahead and view all these configurations.
11; ;00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:26,600; ;What I can see is that I have all-flash arrays selected, and it starts here with all-flash arrays.
12; ;00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:29,340; ;And it has a number of them shown.
13; ;00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:34,810; ;In fact, it has 451 of these out of 902 possibilities.
14; ;00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:49,010; ;They're going to be shown to meet the criteria as shown here on the left-hand side for capacity, for IOPS, for compression, the system models that I want to look at.
15; ;00:01:49,010 --> 00:01:56,960; ;The RAID type and the workload, you see here it's defaulted at 8020 in a 8K block size.
16; ;00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,930; ;Then I can even filter it down to a drive type.
17; ;00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:05,320; ;So you can think of this as more or less your input, you can filter these.
18; ;00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:19,500; ;For example, if I were to search for, look for configurations that suit this criteria for capacity of 200 terabytes to 800, I would be able to go ahead and select these.
19; ;00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:34,340; ;You can see up here now, I'm only going to show 24 of the possible 902 that were available based on, again, my input and my selections, my filtering, if you would, in this site.
20; ;00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:35,430; ;I'll close that up.
21; ;00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:38,890; ;I'm just going to take the default and see what we come up with.
22; ;00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:41,440; ;And again, we have 451 of these.
23; ;00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:45,430; ;Here I can go ahead and sort even further by capacity.
24; ;00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:49,820; ;And if I use the dropdown, I have options available.
25; ;00:02:49,820 --> 00:03:01,080; ;The capacity, low to high, high to low, IOPS, the same, or I can view most popular configurations or even the most viewed configurations.
26; ;00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:09,320; ;So in this, the most viewed configurations are the Unity 50 series.
27; ;00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:11,570; ;I could see those shown here.
28; ;00:03:11,570 --> 00:03:19,630; ;It sizes these based on that criteria, raw capacity.
29; ;00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:28,430; ;Usable capacity, effective capacity, and then the number of IOPS based on the drive type.
30; ;00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:38,260; ;You can see down here to fit the bill for that particular configuration, I needed a total number of 17 drives.
31; ;00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:47,490; ;If I want to choose to reset all my options, my filtering options, I can do that here and I can reset that here.
32; ;00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:54,160; ;And it will go back and show me the original 451.
33; ;00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:56,640; ;You'll see the differences here.
34; ;00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:59,480; ;So again, let's take an example.
35; ;00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:18,240; ;Let's say I want to choose a Unity 550, a capacity of 6.18 terabytes and a usable capacity of 3.41, effective capacity 6.82, and then the IOPS based on 400 gigabytes SAS Flash 3 drives.
36; ;00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:26,000; ;This is going to give me a total, build this with a total of 17 drives in a RAID 6 14+2 configuration.
37; ;00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:37,430; ;This is a 550 series, that 550 series as you know is based on Unity version 4.2 which uses dynamic pools.
38; ;00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:45,360; ;When I select a particular number of drives as you saw in your training, it's automatically going to select that RAID width for you.
39; ;00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,980; ;And that's what they've done here.
40; ;00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:59,860; ;So being this is over 14 drives, I'm going to go ahead and automatically use the best results for that, and that is a 14+2.
41; ;00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:02,140; ;So let's take a look.
42; ;00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:04,150; ;I clicked on the View Results.
43; ;00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:07,660; ;It gives me the information here.
44; ;00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:17,300; ;It shows me really the information that we already saw upfront based on the 80:20 ratio for the workload and in 8K block size.
45; ;00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:23,740; ;It's chosen 17 SAS Flash 3 drives.
46; ;00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:29,260; ;And of course, being a flash drive, flash cache doesn't come into play here.
47; ;00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:33,230; ;It's put over here my pool options.
48; ;00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:40,990; ;At that point, I can select the CNA connectivity that I have in want for the system.
49; ;00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:51,250; ;Of course, all that connectivity in the front-end is going to be figured as well into the performance, into the performance of this particular system.
50; ;00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:56,650; ;If I were to go ahead and select that.
51; ;00:05:56,650 --> 00:06:01,130; ;In this case, I selected a 16 gigabit Fibre Channel SFP.
52; ;00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:06,500; ;For the onboard, I can go ahead and add additional modules.
53; ;00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:13,940; ;Let's say I want to take a four port 1 gig baseT.
54; ;00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:16,280; ;You see the several options I have here.
55; ;00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:28,150; ;In fact, I think I'll just go to a 10 baseT just for better throughput.
56; ;00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:31,240; ;Then again, I have an optional one as well.
57; ;00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:36,830; ;Of course, these systems can take, you know, up to a couple IO modules.
58; ;00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:42,380; ;You also saw here the addition of a 12 gigabit per second SAS back-end bus.
59; ;00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:48,550; ;Well, this being a 550 is going to support that as does the 600 and the 650 models as well.
60; ;00:06:48,550 --> 00:07:01,230; ;The high end Unity models will support that additional IO module to extend the back-end bus numbers for that particular model.
61; ;00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:08,050; ;I'm going to go ahead and select that as well.
62; ;00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:15,090; ;Given that criteria, they'll come up with an alternate configuration as well.
63; ;00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:16,560; ;I could view the results of that.
64; ;00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:20,610; ;That's true for each one of the models you select.
65; ;00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:24,310; ;Other information here of course is about the pool.
66; ;00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:26,190; ;This is Pool 1, that's the default name.
67; ;00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:36,230; ;You could change that name if you choose based upon the SAS Flash 3 drives and the RAID configuration and the information here.
68; ;00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:43,270; ;If I want to change that info, I can do that with the Edit System Designer.
69; ;00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:50,470; ;I can't save this configuration, I'll be asked to save it as a PDF or a XML for MyQuotes.
70; ;00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:56,970; ;I can also view the competition's, competitor's offerings against these particular products.
71; ;00:07:56,970 --> 00:08:01,420; ;And we'll take a look at that a bit later.
72; ;00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:02,680; ;Let's see what I can do with this.
73; ;00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:09,650; ;Once I've selected and I'm happy with that information, power information again is not available to you.
74; ;00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:17,480; ;The additional information gives you information about the version of sizer and the flash percentage in the system drive tier.
75; ;00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:23,290; ;Of course, since it is all-flash, it's going to be extreme performance tier.
76; ;00:08:23,290 --> 00:08:24,930; ;Let's go ahead and export.
77; ;00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:33,620; ;When I export it, it's going to ask me to export it and it has defaults as MyQuotes, XML, or PDF, I would have to give that a name.
78; ;00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:39,260; ;I could do that here.
79; ;00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:42,320; ;If I wanted to describe that, I could do that here as well.
80; ;00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:48,120; ;Then I would just, let's say, I want to export that as simply a PDF file.
81; ;00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:52,420; ;In order for me to do that, if you haven't already saved it, it's going to ask you to save it.
82; ;00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:54,540; ;I'm going to go ahead and do that.
83; ;00:08:54,540 --> 00:09:02,070; ;I'll save it as a project name, number one.
84; ;00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:04,550; ;You see it saves it in the project's name here.
85; ;00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:07,410; ;Now it goes in the process of exporting that.
86; ;00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:20,660; ;I can open that, I can choose to do that here, and it will give me the information, cabinet layouts, and I can view all that information in a PDF format.
87; ;00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:32,070; ;Also, down here where I looked at Saved Configurations, it would be part of that saved configurations list in case I want to list those and choose those again.
88; ;00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:44,170; ;That is the options available for you and an example of the Quick Configuration options and how to use that Quick Configuration menu from the Unity Sizer.
1; ;00:00:01,630 --> 00:00:12,510; ;The Simple Performance path allows sizing applications with minimal input at the very early stages before the complete workload details are available.
2; ;00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:30,580; ;If you're trying to size a configuration, you didn't have a lot of information on what that workload profile was or what's the configuration needed, you can simply start here with a simple performance configuration, have a minimal input, and come up with a solution in the early stages here.
3; ;00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:39,240; ;You select it the same way as we did the other options, we come to the Unity Sizer, select Simple Performance.
4; ;00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:42,770; ;Again, it goes to all-flash pools by default.
5; ;00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:46,360; ;I can select hybrids, and I'll do that here.
6; ;00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:49,620; ;Then I'm going to have the Application Details.
7; ;00:00:51,040 --> 00:01:00,030; ;The Application Details, you're going to have your options through the dropdown for the varying size of the application type, two sizes.
9; ;00:01:01,690 --> 00:01:12,580; ;If you do small read-write mix, that is basically going to be a 3:1 read-write ratio and use a small IO size in the order of 8 kb.
8; ;00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:01,690; ;You can provide a name to that.
10; ;00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:23,870; ;If you were to choose the medium read-write, we still do a 3:1 read-write ratio, but use the 64 kb IO sizes for that.
11; ;00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:35,720; ;Then finally if I go to a small read heavy, well, that particular application type is going to be a 80:20 read-write ratio with a small IO size of 8 Kb.
12; ;00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:38,440; ;You have options to select each one.
13; ;00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:41,340; ;I'm going to leave it in this example at the default.
14; ;00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:48,900; ;I can provide a name, again, it's user selectable, provide a name that's useful to you, makes sense to you.
15; ;00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:52,790; ;Then the load-specific parameters, we have the initial capacity.
16; ;00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:56,500; ;This is, as you can see, is sized in terabytes.
17; ;00:01:56,500 --> 00:02:05,840; ;It's going to hold the usable capacity value in terabytes on the day on which you want to deploy this particular configuration.
18; ;00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:09,930; ;You also have a yearly growth rate.
19; ;00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:18,650; ;This particular option is going to estimate the average annual capacity growth rate and it's going to do that as a percentage.
20; ;00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:21,560; ;You can see here the default is 30%.
21; ;00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:36,160; ;In the Days Hot, well, this is going to specify the estimated duration that the newly created data which stays highly accessed is going to stay, I should say stay highly accessed.
22; ;00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:41,900; ;The default is 45 days, but again, it's an arbitrary value.
23; ;00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:48,450; ;If you have longer durations, it simply means that the data appears more over the total configuration.
24; ;00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:56,100; ;Shorter duration means the access is going to be concentrated and would have a higher skew value.
25; ;00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,580; ;Then you also have Advanced Options.
26; ;00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:08,250; ;If I were to click on Advanced Options, I can see here that I can change the way in which my Tier Specific Parameters are going to be set up.
27; ;00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:09,580; ;It does give you defaults.
28; ;00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:19,260; ;In this case, I have a single pool that will be created from a flash drive, SAS, and then capacity NL-SAS drives.
29; ;00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:23,470; ;It will do so in the drive sizes shown for you here by default.
30; ;00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:28,600; ;You can change those if you choose to do so.
31; ;00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:33,640; ;It defaults to 200 gigabyte SAS Flash 2 drives in the flash tier.
32; ;00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:38,070; ;And it does that in a RAID 5-8 plus 1 configuration.
33; ;00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:39,610; ;You can change those as well.
34; ;00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:44,470; ;In other words, you can change the RAID type if you feel you need to do that.
35; ;00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:49,120; ;And you can choose from the available options for the RAID type shown for you here.
36; ;00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,250; ;RAID 5, 6, or 10.
37; ;00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:54,030; ;You can do the same for the SAS tier.
38; ;00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:59,760; ;You can see again it's a RAID 5 selection of 4 plus 1 for the performance tier.
39; ;00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:00,850; ;You can change that.
40; ;00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:07,080; ;And again, for the capacity tier, so you have options to input there.
41; ;00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:12,250; ;Once I do that and I'm comfortable with those selections, I again just add that workload.
42; ;00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:16,910; ;That workload will appear in the Workloads table.
43; ;00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:25,480; ;This table, again, it contains a single workload here, but it can contain multiple workloads to size a particular solution.
44; ;00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:38,610; ;If you create multiple workloads, you can modify those as well and you can remove it as we saw before by selecting the trash can and deleting that particular workload.
45; ;00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:41,560; ;Of course, you can always reset that workload.
46; ;00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:46,720; ;For this particular simple performance configuration, I'll view the results.
47; ;00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:59,330; ;I can see that in this particular instance, it chose a Unity 300 as the suggested configuration with a raw capacity of 23.65 terabytes.
48; ;00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:02,350; ;It has a 5U footprint.
49; ;00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:13,680; ;The number of IOPS it is capable of doing is 16,182, and the usable capacity, utilization, and the total drive count used for this particular configuration is going to be 31.
50; ;00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:18,720; ;You can see the drive information as shown for you here.
51; ;00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:24,160; ;I have 9 containing a hot spare for a total of 10 drives for the flash tier.
52; ;00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:31,760; ;I can see the information down here for the FAST Cache.
53; ;00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:36,400; ;It used 200-gigabyte flash drives for that, two of those drives.
54; ;00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:43,190; ;Note that it didn't require a hot spare for that particular FAST Cache configuration.
55; ;00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:48,920; ;The pool information is going to be displayed as well.
56; ;00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:55,300; ;We said it created one pool, it was called the pool, the name that was given by the user.
57; ;00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:59,620; ;That pool contains the drives shown for you here.
58; ;00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:14,550; ;This flash, SAS, and the NL-SAS, the configuration for those, the default RAID types, the drive counts that were created for that, and then we have other drives.
59; ;00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:23,950; ;Of course, we have 31 drives, so at least 9 drives, so I have a hot spare a couple here, 2 for the FAST Cache, and 4 for the OS as well.
60; ;00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:27,310; ;That's shown for you here in the graphic.
61; ;00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:32,470; ;You can add your CNA connectivity ports similar to what you could do before.
62; ;00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:37,740; ;I'll just take a couple examples here to show you that.
63; ;00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:49,720; ;I could export that or I could also take a look at the alternate configuration that it shows for me here.
64; ;00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:52,230; ;In this case, it's chosen a Unity 400.
65; ;00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:58,220; ;If I want to edit that, I can do that.
66; ;00:06:58,220 --> 00:06:59,950; ;I can edit with the System Designer.
67; ;00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:04,670; ;It will launch the System Designer page and I can go ahead and edit those parameters.
68; ;00:07:04,670 --> 00:07:14,270; ;I can save that or I can view a competitor's similar configuration that you can compare against the Unity 300.
69; ;00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:31,880; ;Use this to size an application where you don't have a lot of information on the workload profile or a lot of information, you know, to really use for the sizing to start at a really basic level of performance.
70; ;00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:35,180; ;That is the Simple Performance path.
1; ;00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:17,637; ;By looking at some foundational aspects of sizing and design that really have to be considered when you're sizing really any SC Series solution, and a big part of that is information gathering and this is critical obviously to understand the customer's environment.
2; ;00:00:17,637 --> 00:00:22,393; ;So some of the things to keep in mind here is we want to gather during peak workloads.
3; ;00:00:22,393 --> 00:00:26,807; ;Okay, so we don't necessarily want to do off hours, we want to do during peak workloads.
4; ;00:00:26,807 --> 00:00:30,591; ;But we also want to gather during typical workloads.
5; ;00:00:30,591 --> 00:00:32,338; ;Okay, so we don't necessarily...
6; ;00:00:32,338 --> 00:00:40,998; ;If we size for peak, it might be over sizing, so we also want to get some analysis done during typical workloads, okay?
7; ;00:00:40,998 --> 00:00:45,091; ;We want to use aggregate end-to-end IO data, right, host to disk.
8; ;00:00:46,701 --> 00:00:55,351; ;So a couple of key terms that we'll hear in this module but that you're probably familiar with but just to reinforce that, one is latency.
9; ;00:00:55,351 --> 00:00:59,243; ;Latency is defined as wait time, okay?
10; ;00:00:59,243 --> 00:01:10,066; ;It's defined as the time it takes for an IO to be executed or the time it takes for a frame to traverse a cable or a sector on a hard drive platter to be accessed, right.
11; ;00:01:10,066 --> 00:01:16,540; ;All of those things are built in to the hardware and they're defined as wait time, okay?
12; ;00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:18,940; ;So that's opposed to queue depth.
13; ;00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:25,094; ;Queue depth is defined as IOs waiting in line to be serviced, okay?
14; ;00:01:25,094 --> 00:01:37,177; ;So this is very often caused by if a system has insufficient bandwidth or speed, then IOs can queue up, right, in a buffer waiting to be executed.
15; ;00:01:37,177 --> 00:01:41,108; ;So ideally, we want to reduce the amount of queue depth.
16; ;00:01:41,108 --> 00:01:44,745; ;Some queue depth would be expected, right?
17; ;00:01:44,745 --> 00:01:49,842; ;But it's when you get excessive queue depth, that's what we need to design for, okay?
18; ;00:01:49,842 --> 00:01:54,397; ;So we really want to reduce that queuing by providing sufficient bandwidth.
19; ;00:01:54,397 --> 00:02:07,608; ;High queue depth is an indicator of a performance bottleneck or potentially a bandwidth deficiency, and it will lead to increased latency, so that's how those two terms kind of work together.
20; ;00:02:09,225 --> 00:02:12,869; ;So where do we go about gathering information?
21; ;00:02:12,869 --> 00:02:21,330; ;Okay, one of the ways that we do it on, we're using a Dell tool called DPACK, and this is showing the output of DPACK here.
22; ;00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:25,076; ;We're going to... Later on in the module, we'll talk a little more about DPACK.
23; ;00:02:25,076 --> 00:02:37,721; ;And this slide and the upcoming slides are not intended to be train you on DPACK, but they're just to give you an idea of where you get some of this information to help size a system.
24; ;00:02:37,721 --> 00:02:43,713; ;So when you're looking at designing a system, this is showing a 95th percentile.
25; ;00:02:43,713 --> 00:02:50,649; ;So generally speaking, we want to size to the 95th percentile for IOs, okay?
26; ;00:02:50,649 --> 00:02:57,360; ;So you can do some investigation if we want to go to peak or not, right?
27; ;00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:03,007; ;So size to peak only after investigation determines it is necessary, okay?
28; ;00:03:03,007 --> 00:03:13,737; ;So if the peak value is sustained, for example, or driven by a critical workload then maybe the peak is more appropriate measure for sizing IOs, okay?
29; ;00:03:13,737 --> 00:03:27,823; ;Now the issue is if you size to the peak workload without any kind of valid justification, say, a critical workload or something, it will likely result in over provisioning, over pricing the system.
30; ;00:03:27,823 --> 00:03:33,704; ;And that would certainly put you at a competitive disadvantage so you could be much more expensive than a competitor, right?
31; ;00:03:33,704 --> 00:03:43,274; ;So you have to keep that in mind, that's why 95th percentile is a great spot, you know, to initially size the system.
32; ;00:03:43,274 --> 00:03:47,478; ;In this module, we'll be referencing the term DPACK.
33; ;00:03:47,478 --> 00:03:52,211; ;So I thought we should take a minute and explain what it is, right?
34; ;00:03:52,211 --> 00:03:56,911; ;Now many of you may be aware of DPACK and there you can see what it stands for, right?
35; ;00:03:56,911 --> 00:03:58,980; ;DPACK is actually an acronym.
36; ;00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:03,200; ;It stands for Dell Performance Analysis Collection Kit.
37; ;00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:13,348; ;Okay, right, it's a tool that analyzes your customer's environments and really is a core component for helping your sell storage, okay?
38; ;00:04:13,348 --> 00:04:20,645; ;Now also, tool for collecting and analyzing performance data from workloads besides storage, right?
39; ;00:04:20,645 --> 00:04:27,242; ;Servers and networking also has information that can be gathered from DPACK, okay?
40; ;00:04:27,242 --> 00:04:37,353; ;So kind of to define what DPACK is it's a performance capture technology to promote the awareness of actual compute performance needs.
41; ;00:04:37,353 --> 00:04:47,942; ;Specifically as it applies to understanding physical or virtual server workloads at the individual machine, workgroup, or datacenter levels, okay?
42; ;00:04:47,942 --> 00:05:03,368; ;Just to give you a couple of benefits around DPACK, and again, we'll talk more about DPACK a little later in the module here, but one of the of the great benefits about it, it really reduces the complexity in preparing a properly sized storage solution.
43; ;00:05:03,368 --> 00:05:11,376; ;So the DPACK analysis will give you real world examples of what's happening in the customer's environment, right?
44; ;00:05:11,376 --> 00:05:20,897; ;Very often the customer gives you an idea of what their IOs are or what they think their read versus write percentage ratios are.
45; ;00:05:20,897 --> 00:05:33,697; ;But DPACK gives you actual information based on the customer's environment, so it's a very practical way to promote Dell Storage into the environment.
46; ;00:05:33,697 --> 00:05:38,867; ;So what are some best practices around sizing in SC Series system?
47; ;00:05:38,867 --> 00:05:47,922; ;Well, really the most critical element of system design in the Storage Center is design for performance first, okay?
48; ;00:05:47,922 --> 00:06:04,642; ;It's really imperative to ensure that the Storage Center solution provides all the hosts that are going to be attached to it with enough disk IOs to be able to satisfy all write and read requests within the tier of storage that contains the active data set.
49; ;00:06:04,642 --> 00:06:07,998; ;So again, this is typically going to be Tier 1.
50; ;00:06:07,998 --> 00:06:27,961; ;So really, you know, it's not the only performance measure, you have to be concerned with, but it really is the primary, making sure there's enough IO in Tier 1 to handle all of the applications are going to be running from the different servers attached to the SC Series, okay?
51; ;00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:35,785; ;Now after performance of course, you need to design the system so there's enough capacity.
52; ;00:06:35,785 --> 00:06:43,692; ;So all of the, you know, information that needs to be stored on the SAN can be stored, right?
53; ;00:06:43,692 --> 00:06:49,316; ;Okay, so you're designing for performance first but we can't totally ignore capacity.
54; ;00:06:49,316 --> 00:07:01,557; ;So this is why we'll talk about this as we go through this module, but again, generally, you're designing for performance first which is going to be in Tier 1, make sure you have enough IOs in Tier 1.
55; ;00:07:01,557 --> 00:07:10,322; ;And then design for capacity second, and that capacity is, generally speaking, going to be in Tier 3, okay?
56; ;00:07:10,322 --> 00:07:29,668; ;So that's a big part of the SC Series then because of the way the Fluid Data architecture, the way the virtualization works, front-end IOPS will take advantage of all the system's disk resources and benefit from the aggregate IO throughout the entire system, okay?
57; ;00:07:29,668 --> 00:07:43,679; ;One of the things if you haven't configured an SC Series solution yet, experienced designers have far fewer IO design concerns compared to traditional storage solutions, okay?
58; ;00:07:43,679 --> 00:07:51,554; ;And it's mainly because the Storage Center software applies a layer of abstraction to physical RAID groups.
59; ;00:07:51,554 --> 00:07:59,884; ;So a tier can become a highly performing bundle of disk drives that provide the aggregate IOPS from all active spindles.
60; ;00:07:59,884 --> 00:08:03,067; ;Okay, we'll talk a little bit more about that as we go through this module.
61; ;00:08:04,372 --> 00:08:16,607; ;So as we were discussing the IOPS that we're getting from the disk drives, the other key element of performance is sizing of the front-end for throughput, okay?
62; ;00:08:16,607 --> 00:08:23,758; ;So this is a chart, again, taken from DPACK that shows the aggregate throughput of a prospect's environment.
63; ;00:08:23,758 --> 00:08:34,443; ;Okay, so the difference between throughput and IOs per second is it's best to target the peak value when designing front-end network connectivity.
64; ;00:08:34,443 --> 00:08:37,478; ;Okay, so we're talking about front-end network connectivity.
65; ;00:08:37,478 --> 00:08:43,956; ;How are we connecting servers to the SAN, right?
66; ;00:08:43,956 --> 00:08:51,703; ;So you'll notice here, there is no line designating a 95th percentile as we had seen on the previous slide.
67; ;00:08:53,595 --> 00:08:59,758; ;Right, we're talking about IOPS, we're looking at 95th percentile if you recall, right?
68; ;00:08:59,758 --> 00:09:03,212; ;Now we're talking about throughput to the hosts here.
69; ;00:09:03,212 --> 00:09:08,151; ;Remember, IOPS are focused on the drives, right?
70; ;00:09:08,151 --> 00:09:14,270; ;How many drives we have, how many drives we need to get those IOs per second.
71; ;00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:25,469; ;Here we're talking about what kind of bandwidth, what kind of throughput are we getting, and again, there's no 95th percentile, we want to size the front-end to the peak value, okay?
72; ;00:09:25,469 --> 00:09:29,838; ;So it's important to pay close attention to this, right?
73; ;00:09:29,838 --> 00:09:47,787; ;So since IOPS is done by selecting the number and types of disk drives required, as we talked about, sizing for throughput is done by selecting the type and number of front-end ports on the Storage Center needed to handle the network traffic, okay?
74; ;00:09:47,787 --> 00:09:53,120; ;So that's an important piece, right, because is it iSCSI, is it Fibre Channel?
75; ;00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:59,492; ;These are the things you're analyzing when you start looking at front-end throughput, okay?
76; ;00:09:59,492 --> 00:10:03,728; ;So it's an important consideration of performance as well.
77; ;00:10:04,782 --> 00:10:16,918; ;So as we talk about performance being really the key element, the most critical element in sizing on an SC Series, let's look at some influencing factors around performance.
78; ;00:10:16,918 --> 00:10:21,721; ;So the first one you see here is backup and maintenance windows, okay?
79; ;00:10:21,721 --> 00:10:26,398; ;So our higher IOPS observed during backup and maintenance windows.
80; ;00:10:26,398 --> 00:10:37,940; ;If they are, the engineer may be able to consider reducing the amount of IOPS as backup windows are not always a requirement for customer performance needs, right?
81; ;00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:50,301; ;Now don't necessarily assume this because the customer may be looking at the Storage Center system as a way to reduce the backup window.
82; ;00:10:50,301 --> 00:10:56,659; ;So it's not necessarily an assumption but it's something again to take a look at, what is that backup and what are those maintenance windows.
83; ;00:10:56,659 --> 00:10:58,973; ;Did we get a representative sample?
84; ;00:10:58,973 --> 00:11:01,747; ;Right, so we ran that DPACK.
85; ;00:11:01,747 --> 00:11:07,997; ;The sample we get a typical workload, okay, or was it just peak performance or the flip side, right?
86; ;00:11:07,997 --> 00:11:10,183; ;Was it really a slow period?
87; ;00:11:10,183 --> 00:11:15,412; ;Okay, so make sure you have a representative sample that you're analyzing.
88; ;00:11:15,412 --> 00:11:24,337; ;Another big thing to keep in mind when we look at performance and number of IOPS to design for is block size, okay?
89; ;00:11:24,337 --> 00:11:31,276; ;Large block size, and this is coming from the application now, right, could cause unanticipated latencies.
90; ;00:11:31,276 --> 00:11:40,305; ;So it's very important to pay attention to block size and what apps are going to be run against the SC Series, okay?
91; ;00:11:40,305 --> 00:11:42,175; ;And then read-write percent.
92; ;00:11:42,175 --> 00:11:45,712; ;Again, this is another critical piece that you have to size for.
93; ;00:11:45,712 --> 00:11:54,222; ;And the DPACK will give you the typical read-write percentage of a customer's environment, okay?
94; ;00:11:54,222 --> 00:11:59,058; ;The data analysis does not pre-suppose disk RAID configurations, right?
95; ;00:11:59,058 --> 00:12:09,041; ;So the advantage of the way that we do it is most competitive arrays, they don't offer a RAID 10 to RAID 5 conversion, that's standard, right?
96; ;00:12:09,041 --> 00:12:15,813; ;That's the design the software architecture in the Storage Center, okay?
97; ;00:12:15,813 --> 00:12:27,192; ;So it's standard to assume RAID 10 writes which is the recommended storage profile right in the Tier 1, so one should factor double IOPS for reported writes.
98; ;00:12:27,192 --> 00:12:33,013; ;So we'll get into some of the formulas a little bit later on, we have to keep that in mind.
99; ;00:12:33,013 --> 00:12:40,154; ;And for IOPS, we want to consider double the writes for the actual write numbers.
100; ;00:12:40,154 --> 00:12:45,057; ;Okay, let's look at a couple other factors that can influence performance, right?
101; ;00:12:45,057 --> 00:12:49,792; ;Starting with sequential and random IOPS, okay?
102; ;00:12:49,792 --> 00:12:56,155; ;Now storage virtualization as is done on the Storage Center tends to randomize workloads.
103; ;00:12:56,155 --> 00:13:05,975; ;In fact, the SC Series design standards are based on random IO because of the way that data is written in the Storage Center.
104; ;00:13:05,975 --> 00:13:22,093; ;Now there are times, however, when Storage Center arrays will be purpose-built for a particular sequential IO app, so that's what the customer's looking for, right, is a sequential app and they want to write all their data sequentially.
105; ;00:13:22,093 --> 00:13:30,957; ;Now when you do that, sequential access equates a speedier access a lot less latency, okay?
106; ;00:13:30,957 --> 00:13:46,032; ;So if it was designed for sequential access, just be aware that if you introduce a different application where there's random IO into a system that was initially designed for sequential could very well be an impact on performance, okay?
107; ;00:13:46,032 --> 00:13:48,236; ;So just keep that in mind.
108; ;00:13:48,236 --> 00:13:51,752; ;Another performance influencing factor, growth rate.
109; ;00:13:51,752 --> 00:13:54,370; ;So growth rate equates to new applications.
110; ;00:13:54,370 --> 00:14:00,605; ;So new applications meaning, what are you going to be adding to the SAN down the line, six months, a year down the line.
111; ;00:14:00,605 --> 00:14:05,160; ;So keep in mind what that growth rate might be, okay?
112; ;00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:08,761; ;And we'll talk in more detail about all these in the next few slides.
113; ;00:14:09,836 --> 00:14:11,837; ;Change rate is another thing to keep in mind.
114; ;00:14:11,837 --> 00:14:18,979; ;Change rate is different than growth rate because change rate looks at the number of replays that we're going to be taking.
115; ;00:14:19,713 --> 00:14:26,159; ;So if you're not familiar with the Storage Center, replays are snapshots, right?
116; ;00:14:26,159 --> 00:14:33,182; ;So an industry term would be a snapshot, in the Storage Center we refer to snapshots as replays, okay?
117; ;00:14:34,502 --> 00:14:43,776; ;So the change rate then represents the percentage of modifications to data that was written to disk at one time, okay?
118; ;00:14:43,776 --> 00:15:00,208; ;So change rates are real fundamental to establish to make sure there's enough capacity in Tier 1 such that if we're doing a lot of replays, right, that the performance is not impacted by all those replays, okay?
119; ;00:15:00,208 --> 00:15:02,306; ;And that's what change rate really is talking about.
120; ;00:15:03,827 --> 00:15:07,765; ;Another critical factor is latency, okay?
121; ;00:15:07,765 --> 00:15:14,723; ;And as we've talked about, there are many things that can impact performance even sort of behind the scenes.
122; ;00:15:14,723 --> 00:15:22,953; ;Some features in the SC Series like data progression, compression, replication, encryption, right?
123; ;00:15:22,953 --> 00:15:31,358; ;They all have an impact on performance and they can cause latency in the array because they're happening behind the scenes, okay?
124; ;00:15:31,358 --> 00:15:49,376; ;And certainly the SC Series model can have an impact as far as latency goes, right, because depending on the model that you get, if you get an SCv2000 as opposed to an SC9000, the latency can be tremendously different, right, between each one.
125; ;00:15:49,376 --> 00:15:55,431; ;So all of those things have to be taken into account when we're sizing for performance.
126; ;00:15:56,459 --> 00:15:59,067; ;And then future application growth.
127; ;00:15:59,067 --> 00:16:10,481; ;Okay, so does the design include the IO loads, we referred to IOs as loads, and capacities of future applications.
128; ;00:16:10,481 --> 00:16:13,225; ;Okay, slightly different than growth rate.
129; ;00:16:13,225 --> 00:16:22,052; ;Future application growth, means applications that may or will be added to the Storage Center in the future, okay?
130; ;00:16:23,418 --> 00:16:29,364; ;One little hint here, incremental backups are a good indication of a customer's change rate, okay?
131; ;00:16:29,364 --> 00:16:32,764; ;It also can give you an idea of the read-write ratio.
132; ;00:16:32,764 --> 00:16:40,198; ;So it's not the only measure but it can be a good way to kind of have the customer check because it's something that they have already.
133; ;00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:53,526; ;We defined change rate and growth rate on the previous slide but oftentimes, there is some confusion when we talk about those topics.
134; ;00:16:53,526 --> 00:16:57,458; ;People are not sure what's the difference between change rate and growth rate.
135; ;00:16:57,458 --> 00:17:00,319; ;So we want to just kind of clarify here on this slide.
136; ;00:17:00,319 --> 00:17:07,353; ;First of all, change rate again represents the percentage of modifications to data written to disk at one time.
137; ;00:17:08,912 --> 00:17:17,989; ;Change rates are fundamental to ensure that there is sufficient capacity in Tier 1 such that performance is not impacted, okay?
138; ;00:17:17,989 --> 00:17:19,788; ;So let's kind of look at an example.
139; ;00:17:19,788 --> 00:17:36,122; ;So if a user writes 1 gigabyte a day but this overwrites 1 gig of data already on the disk, then there literally is no growth.
140; ;00:17:36,122 --> 00:17:42,991; ;0 gig per day growth but 1 gig per day of change.
141; ;00:17:42,991 --> 00:17:44,805; ;Does that make sense?
142; ;00:17:44,805 --> 00:17:57,214; ;Okay, as opposed to the growth rate, by definition, that's the difference in the amount of capacity from one point in time to another and this is calculated as a percentage.
143; ;00:17:58,637 --> 00:18:06,043; ;This measurement is typically presented as a monthly or as our little example here, annual growth rate, okay?
144; ;00:18:06,043 --> 00:18:12,284; ;So you can see on January 1st, we had 10 terabytes written, okay?
145; ;00:18:12,284 --> 00:18:23,746; ;And then time 2 or December 31st, we had 15 terabytes, so that the annual growth rate as you look at the calculation there is 50%.
146; ;00:18:23,746 --> 00:18:33,484; ;Kind of get the difference there between change rate and growth rate because both have to be considered in a good sizing design.
147; ;00:18:33,484 --> 00:18:42,691; ;But of course, capacity is the other key consideration that you have to keep in mind when you're sizing for an SC Series solution, okay?
148; ;00:18:42,691 --> 00:18:47,554; ;It may be secondary to performance considerations, however, it's got to be factored in.
149; ;00:18:47,554 --> 00:18:57,054; ;So some of the things to consider when you're designing, especially a multi-tier SC Series arrays, how much space should be designated for each tier?
150; ;00:18:58,809 --> 00:19:08,176; ;Okay, so it says down there, a majority of SC Series solutions are two tiers and those two tiers are generally Tier 1 and 3.
151; ;00:19:08,176 --> 00:19:14,109; ;As we said earlier, probably 65% to 70% of our systems are two-tier.
152; ;00:19:14,109 --> 00:19:16,349; ;Okay, so it's important to...
153; ;00:19:16,349 --> 00:19:26,230; ;When you're sizing for capacities, we'll look at active and inactive data, replay space, growth, and RAID efficiencies.
154; ;00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:30,051; ;Again, we'll cover all these in some more details in the upcoming slide.
155; ;00:19:30,051 --> 00:19:34,827; ;But what does capacity mean in an SC Series array?
156; ;00:19:34,827 --> 00:19:41,652; ;So if you're not familiar with the way the SC Series works, capacity really means pages.
157; ;00:19:41,652 --> 00:19:47,883; ;Okay, so in the system the default is 2 meg page sizes.
158; ;00:19:47,883 --> 00:19:54,068; ;Now in a flash array, you'll see 512K pages, okay?
159; ;00:19:54,068 --> 00:19:59,158; ;So those are really the two that we're looking at 512K, or 2 meg page sizes.
160; ;00:19:59,158 --> 00:20:09,168; ;So these little 2 meg pages provide the small and manageable platform upon which blocks of data can move effortlessly between tiers.
161; ;00:20:09,168 --> 00:20:15,214; ;So these pages are moving from tier to tier and these pages are very small, okay?
162; ;00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:23,892; ;So they can move across RAID classes and even from one part of one physical disk to another, okay?
163; ;00:20:23,892 --> 00:20:33,919; ;Because of the way pages work, they take advantage of all the disk resources throughout the Storage Center and all of the features that are part of Storage Center.
164; ;00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:41,512; ;So they're kind of based on some policy engines of storage profiles and replay profiles.
165; ;00:20:41,512 --> 00:20:54,703; ;So by default, the Storage Center Operating System, it creates a page pool to accommodate those 2 meg pages or 512K pages, okay?
166; ;00:20:54,703 --> 00:21:06,300; ;So again, that page size is configurable upon initial installation of the system and it can be changed if necessary, okay?
167; ;00:21:07,462 --> 00:21:09,095; ;So capacity...
168; ;00:21:09,095 --> 00:21:12,803; ;So let's talk about each of these as we get into the next few slides.
169; ;00:21:14,708 --> 00:21:19,051; ;Okay, sprinkled throughout the module will be some review questions.
170; ;00:21:19,051 --> 00:21:31,167; ;So generally, these slides will have three questions on them, just something for you to think about, they are question that covers topics that we've just seen.
171; ;00:21:31,167 --> 00:21:42,430; ;Now it might be good to note the answers to these review questions because you may see a question like this on an upcoming quiz and then potentially on the final exam.
172; ;00:21:42,430 --> 00:21:51,504; ;So our first question in this slide is when discussing system performance sizing and tuning, what term is defined as wait time?
173; ;00:21:52,561 --> 00:21:53,576; ;We talked about that.
174; ;00:21:53,576 --> 00:21:54,706; ;Do you remember that one?
175; ;00:21:56,348 --> 00:21:57,672; ;Yup, good. Latency.
176; ;00:21:59,513 --> 00:22:02,350; ;What's the most critical element of system design in the Storage Center?
177; ;00:22:02,350 --> 00:22:03,731; ;So we hit this pretty hard.
178; ;00:22:03,731 --> 00:22:05,043; ;I'm sure you got this one, right?
179; ;00:22:05,043 --> 00:22:06,259; ;Performance.
180; ;00:22:08,543 --> 00:22:13,331; ;So we had several factors that influence performance on a storage system.
181; ;00:22:14,590 --> 00:22:18,861; ;You think you can list five of those factors?
182; ;00:22:19,889 --> 00:22:21,746; ;And we'll show all of the answers here.
183; ;00:22:23,239 --> 00:22:29,988; ;We'll give you a few minutes to kind of ponder that and think of the five factors, just give me five factors.
184; ;00:22:33,573 --> 00:22:35,370; ;All right, so we're going to go through those.
185; ;00:22:35,370 --> 00:22:51,144; ;Backup and maintenance window, block size, read-write percentage, growth rate, change rate, sequential and random IOPS, latency, and future application growth.
186; ;00:22:51,144 --> 00:22:54,626; ;Okay, so hopefully, you came up with five of those.
1; ;00:00:02,099 --> 00:00:06,745; ;As we head into the next section here, first, there's a quick discussion question.
2; ;00:00:06,745 --> 00:00:17,804; ;And then as we saw before, on the last discussion question, we're going to have a question, and think about that question, and then we'll answer that in the upcoming slides.
3; ;00:00:17,804 --> 00:00:22,721; ;What are some preliminary sizing steps when sizing an SC Series?
4; ;00:00:24,044 --> 00:00:26,362; ;Okay, we haven't really talked about that.
5; ;00:00:26,362 --> 00:00:34,202; ;And I guess the last slide kind of touched on it, right, the last slide before the quiz or before the review questions.
6; ;00:00:34,202 --> 00:00:39,596; ;Determine active versus inactive data, growth rate, RAID overhead.
7; ;00:00:39,596 --> 00:00:46,673; ;These are just a couple of the things you could have come up with, right?
8; ;00:00:46,673 --> 00:00:50,558; ;So we're going to talk about these as we go forward.
9; ;00:00:50,558 --> 00:00:54,429; ;So let's talk about preliminary sizing steps.
10; ;00:00:54,429 --> 00:01:00,019; ;Okay, so these really need to be analyzed before you size any SC Series opportunity.
11; ;00:01:03,612 --> 00:01:04,865; ;So what are they?
12; ;00:01:04,865 --> 00:01:11,475; ;So a lot of these are what we've just talked about in the capacity section, that slide earlier on capacity.
13; ;00:01:11,475 --> 00:01:16,056; ;But they kind of incorporate both capacity and IOPS, all right?
14; ;00:01:16,056 --> 00:01:19,449; ;So determine active versus inactive data.
15; ;00:01:19,449 --> 00:01:24,109; ;Okay, now this is a bit of an inexact science.
16; ;00:01:24,109 --> 00:01:37,901; ;So we'll cover this in some more detail in the next slide, then actually what we'll do is we'll kind of run through these steps just to kind of have you think about them and then going forward, in the upcoming slides, we'll talk about each of these in some more detail.
17; ;00:01:37,901 --> 00:01:42,606; ;So determining active versus inactive data is a critical piece.
18; ;00:01:42,606 --> 00:01:50,730; ;Determine the use of replays and how the customer is planning on using replays, determine the growth rate.
19; ;00:01:53,606 --> 00:01:55,406; ;What's involved with RAID overhead?
20; ;00:01:55,406 --> 00:02:08,652; ;So we haven't talked a lot about RAID overhead yet in determining capacity, so we're going to talk a lot more about that here in this section 'cause it is something to consider when you're first getting started.
21; ;00:02:08,652 --> 00:02:11,897; ;Verify tier 3 performance needs, right?
22; ;00:02:11,897 --> 00:02:25,154; ;So tier 3 are the larger drives, typically the slower drives, but there's going to be some performance we need down there, some IOPS, not just capacity, so keep that in mind.
23; ;00:02:25,154 --> 00:02:33,296; ;And then what's the impact of thin provisioning on the SC Series especially in terms of sizing.
24; ;00:02:35,129 --> 00:02:38,528; ;So here are all the preliminary sizing steps.
25; ;00:02:38,528 --> 00:02:43,920; ;What we want to do now is to analyze these in some more detail one at a time.
26; ;00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:49,615; ;So that first one, first preliminary sizing step, determine active versus inactive data.
27; ;00:02:49,615 --> 00:02:55,946; ;So active data is defined as files that have recently been written, read from, or modified.
28; ;00:02:55,946 --> 00:03:09,467; ;So obviously, recently, you know, is a pretty subjective term, okay, so kind of think of it as a recently accessed file that depends heavily upon the relative importance of its value, right?
29; ;00:03:09,467 --> 00:03:19,467; ;So if it's a database, it's going to be active data if that data is critical, which it most assuredly is to a customer's business, okay?
30; ;00:03:19,467 --> 00:03:24,748; ;And inactive data is data that has not recently been accessed, right?
31; ;00:03:24,748 --> 00:03:39,030; ;Again, fairly subjective, can be any real time period, but active data, especially is unstructured file data, typically turns inactive at some point between 30 and 90 days.
32; ;00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:45,260; ;Okay, structured data, databases, for example, a lot sooner than that, okay?
33; ;00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:52,500; ;So perhaps this data is less important relative to other data, and it might rarely be accessed, okay?
34; ;00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:56,709; ;Often you'll hear of this data referred to as stale.
35; ;00:03:56,709 --> 00:04:09,838; ;Now this stale data or this inactive data takes up space obviously, but it has implications far beyond its physical occupation of the platters, if you will, right?
36; ;00:04:09,838 --> 00:04:13,535; ;If you think about it, as drives fill up, performance is affected, right?
37; ;00:04:13,535 --> 00:04:21,601; ;As drive IO potential is reduced and latency continues to increase, backup and recovery times increase.
38; ;00:04:21,601 --> 00:04:26,679; ;Drive outages on platters that are full mean longer rebuild times.
39; ;00:04:26,679 --> 00:04:35,162; ;So certainly as drives get more and more full, it can have a huge impact on the performance of a system, okay?
40; ;00:04:35,162 --> 00:04:40,205; ;So what does inactive data have to do with capacity sizing, okay?
41; ;00:04:40,205 --> 00:04:49,070; ;Well, one thing it shouldn't have a lot to do with sizing in active tier, tier 1 primarily, right?
42; ;00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:57,203; ;Okay, in the Storage Center, inactive data should not take up residence in the sectors of high-performance drives.
43; ;00:04:57,203 --> 00:05:08,666; ;This is where data progression comes in because data progression will move that inactive data down to the more inexpensive disks, down to tier 3, okay?
44; ;00:05:08,666 --> 00:05:30,167; ;So if you're sizing for active versus inactive data, and again, we use our two-tier system as a guide, so the standard for active or tier 1 sizing is 30% of desired capacity in tier 1 with inactive data encompasses the other 70%, and we want it to be in tier 3.
45; ;00:05:30,167 --> 00:05:42,090; ;Okay, so we'll talk a little bit more about this and get into some specific ratios a little later on in the module, but that gives you kind of an idea, a 70-30 split is pretty common.
46; ;00:05:44,134 --> 00:05:50,861; ;So the next preliminary sizing step that we want to take a look at is determining the use of replays.
47; ;00:05:50,861 --> 00:05:54,014; ;As we said, they're also referred to as snapshots.
48; ;00:05:54,014 --> 00:06:01,558; ;So what are some replay characteristics just to get an idea of why you want to size for replays.
49; ;00:06:01,558 --> 00:06:05,458; ;So replays don't require any pre-allocated space, right?
50; ;00:06:05,458 --> 00:06:17,647; ;Now compared to some of our competitors where you have to have an area of the disks that have to be set aside for snapshots, in the Storage Center, you don't have that.
51; ;00:06:17,647 --> 00:06:21,532; ;All right, you don't have to pre-allocate any space.
52; ;00:06:21,532 --> 00:06:37,969; ;So it can span all tiers, tiers 1 if you have 1, 2, and 3 as kind of the slide is showing here, the graphic on the slide is showing, it covers all three tiers, the replay does, okay?
53; ;00:06:40,048 --> 00:06:48,153; ;Now one of the other thing is replays take up no amount of system space as well as spanning all the tiers, okay?
54; ;00:06:48,153 --> 00:06:54,608; ;So In other words, if I take a replay, I'm just freezing the block as read-only.
55; ;00:06:54,608 --> 00:07:01,112; ;If I continue to read from that, I'm not taking up any extra space at all, right?
56; ;00:07:01,112 --> 00:07:14,525; ;And if I add changes, if I make changes to that page or that block as we call it, that will create a new page, right?
57; ;00:07:14,525 --> 00:07:23,812; ;But if all I do is read from that particular 2 meg page, I'm not taking up any extra space at all, okay.
58; ;00:07:23,812 --> 00:07:32,616; ;Replays are point-in-time copies and, as we mentioned, are read-only because of that, okay?
59; ;00:07:32,616 --> 00:07:38,233; ;So remember that replay pages contain actual blocks of data.
60; ;00:07:38,233 --> 00:07:44,197; ;And the amount of data depends entirely on the amount of changes, okay?
61; ;00:07:44,197 --> 00:07:50,382; ;As we just mentioned, if there's no changes to a page, all we're doing is reading from it, there's no space taken up.
62; ;00:07:50,382 --> 00:07:57,364; ;If I'm making changes and if do a lot of replays, I'm going to have more pages taken up.
63; ;00:07:57,364 --> 00:08:01,113; ;Okay, so this is what we mean by change rate.
64; ;00:08:01,113 --> 00:08:15,353; ;Okay, so overall system capacity consideration should be taken into account if a customer desires to hold on to significant numbers of these point-in-time copies or these replays.
65; ;00:08:15,353 --> 00:08:27,018; ;So it depends on not only how often they take replays and then how much that data is changing but then how long do they want to keep these replays.
66; ;00:08:27,018 --> 00:08:37,076; ;So, kind of a best practice, what we very often do, and it depends on the environment, it depends on the customer environment, is assumed 20%, okay?
67; ;00:08:37,076 --> 00:08:44,533; ;Now it can be a little more than that, usually not less to be honest, usually it's going to be 20%, maybe a little more than that.
68; ;00:08:44,533 --> 00:08:49,938; ;So that 20% overhead is placed on tier 3 capacity, okay?
69; ;00:08:49,938 --> 00:08:59,897; ;The thought processes being data progression is going to move these pages down to tier 3, these replay pages, okay?
70; ;00:08:59,897 --> 00:09:13,195; ;Now if a proposed solution only includes one tier in the design, say, like an all-flash array, for example, then 20% overhead will be defaulted obviously into tier 1, okay?
71; ;00:09:13,195 --> 00:09:18,124; ;So multiple tiers, you're going to put it in tier 3, okay?
72; ;00:09:18,124 --> 00:09:26,164; ;Whether you're using sizing tools or whether you're manually calculating the configuration, RAID overhead is configurable, right?
73; ;00:09:26,164 --> 00:09:31,129; ;So you don't have to say 20%, it could be 25%, could be 15%.
74; ;00:09:31,129 --> 00:09:41,640; ;And again, it's not even required if you wanted to go that route, but it's highly recommended because replays are such an important feature of the SC Series.
75; ;00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:48,109; ;Okay, the next preliminary sizing step we want to taken into account is the growth rate.
76; ;00:09:48,109 --> 00:10:00,151; ;Okay, so growth rates are different than replays, right, because we're talking about entirely new sets of data being added to the system as opposed to pages that are changing in an existing system.
77; ;00:10:00,151 --> 00:10:08,453; ;So this can be new data added through an existing application or a new application with new data, okay?
78; ;00:10:08,453 --> 00:10:14,749; ;Again, the recommended best practice is to set a 20% growth rate.
79; ;00:10:14,749 --> 00:10:23,066; ;Again, unlike replays though, growth is applied ubiquitously across all tiers of the array not just tier 3, right?
80; ;00:10:23,066 --> 00:10:31,121; ;So think of it, if I'm adding a new application, chances are I'm going to have a lot of activity on that application, right?
81; ;00:10:31,121 --> 00:10:33,425; ;There's a reason that I added it to the SAN.
82; ;00:10:33,425 --> 00:10:37,278; ;So a lot of that activities is going to mean tier 1.
83; ;00:10:37,278 --> 00:10:39,868; ;So that's where it's different than replays.
84; ;00:10:39,868 --> 00:10:53,066; ;Again, like replays, it's not required, but it's a good idea to incorporate the growth rate into your sizing of your customer's SC Series.
85; ;00:10:53,066 --> 00:11:01,339; ;RAID efficiency is another preliminary sizing step that is really important in the overall system design.
86; ;00:11:01,339 --> 00:11:11,173; ;So, as we build out this slide here, let's look at RAID efficiency and some of the components of it, starting with single-redundant RAID.
87; ;00:11:11,173 --> 00:11:13,854; ;Probably most of you are familiar with single-redundant RAID.
88; ;00:11:13,854 --> 00:11:19,373; ;We have RAID 10, RAID 5-9, and RAID 5-5.
89; ;00:11:19,373 --> 00:11:23,643; ;So the efficiency of RAID 10 is 50%, right?
90; ;00:11:23,643 --> 00:11:30,893; ;Basically, I have data and mirror, so I have to have the same amount of space for a mirror as I have for where data is stored.
91; ;00:11:30,893 --> 00:11:35,364; ;So that's RAID 10, 50% efficiency, 1:2 as it says there.
92; ;00:11:35,364 --> 00:11:38,353; ;RAID 5-9, I have eight data drives.
93; ;00:11:38,353 --> 00:11:42,694; ;And in a group of nine drives, I've got one parity drive.
94; ;00:11:42,694 --> 00:11:47,652; ;So that gives us 89% efficiency, certainly much more efficient than RAID 10.
95; ;00:11:47,652 --> 00:11:52,252; ;Then RAID 5-5, I've got 80% efficiency, right?
96; ;00:11:52,252 --> 00:12:02,571; ;So four of five drives in a group of five, four of them are data and one is for parity.
97; ;00:12:02,571 --> 00:12:06,758; ;So let's look at dual-redundant RAID and efficiency of it.
98; ;00:12:06,758 --> 00:12:08,875; ;So there's two components to that.
99; ;00:12:08,875 --> 00:12:13,540; ;There's RAID 10 dual mirror and then RAID 6.
100; ;00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:16,744; ;Okay, so RAID 10 dual mirror is 1-3.
101; ;00:12:16,744 --> 00:12:20,958; ;Remember I've got a data drive and then two mirror drives, okay?
102; ;00:12:20,958 --> 00:12:27,562; ;So everything about RAID 10 dual mirror is making sure the data is protected, but at what cost, right?
103; ;00:12:27,562 --> 00:12:31,301; ;So it's 33% efficient, RAID 10 dual mirror.
104; ;00:12:31,301 --> 00:12:41,063; ;We have RAID 6-10, right, which is 8 drives for data, 2 drives for parity, so out of a 10-drive grouping, so that's 80% efficient.
105; ;00:12:41,063 --> 00:12:48,271; ;And then RAID 6-6, which four drives for data in a group of six with two drives for parity.
106; ;00:12:48,271 --> 00:12:50,694; ;So that's 66% efficient.
107; ;00:12:50,694 --> 00:12:58,497; ;It gives you kind of an idea of the difference then between single and dual redundant RAID types, okay?
108; ;00:12:58,497 --> 00:13:09,192; ;So, depending on the tier mix, this will determine the overall efficiency of the array's protection at the device level, okay?
109; ;00:13:09,192 --> 00:13:19,697; ;The RAID mix within an individual tier, which is really more important to understand this RAID mix in a tier than even the efficiency of the whole system.
110; ;00:13:19,697 --> 00:13:27,059; ;But this RAID mix within a tier will determine the capacity efficiency for data stored within that tier.
111; ;00:13:27,059 --> 00:13:35,755; ;And this is especially critical when it comes to tier 1 because this will help determine how much capacity to purchase in tier 1, right?
112; ;00:13:35,755 --> 00:13:45,603; ;So let's kind of take a look first of all then at some guidelines for particularly dual redundancy usage, when it's recommended, and when it's required.
113; ;00:13:45,603 --> 00:13:49,439; ;And we're kind of showing that here on the bottom half of the screen.
114; ;00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:57,969; ;Okay, so dual redundancy is recommended and required based on the size of the drive, right?
115; ;00:13:57,969 --> 00:14:05,599; ;And the intent of this is to minimize the risk of a second drive failing before the RAID rebuild is complete.
116; ;00:14:05,599 --> 00:14:09,663; ;And that's the whole idea with dual redundancy anyway.
117; ;00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:19,808; ;So starting with SCOS version 7.0, all SSD drives greater than 4 terabytes require dual redundancy.
118; ;00:14:19,808 --> 00:14:30,556; ;In other words, it's a software, so you go into Dell Storage Manager, the software, if you've got SSDs greater than 4 terabytes, it will force dual redundancy, right?
119; ;00:14:30,556 --> 00:14:32,343; ;It's a requirement.
120; ;00:14:32,343 --> 00:14:41,451; ;However, Dell Storage recommends dual redundancy as a best practice for any SSDs greater than 1.7 terabytes.
121; ;00:14:41,451 --> 00:14:46,307; ;So it's not a requirement, however, it's highly recommended, okay?
122; ;00:14:46,307 --> 00:14:51,169; ;So that's what we're showing up here in the recommended as opposed to required.
123; ;00:14:51,169 --> 00:15:07,895; ;Now HDDs have lower limits because it takes a lot longer to rebuild spinning disks, so with hard disk all HDDs, 2 terabytes and above, the requirement is dual redundancy.
124; ;00:15:07,895 --> 00:15:16,437; ;Okay, now if you have an existing page pool, and that's what makes a distinction here between a new page pool and an existing page pool.
125; ;00:15:16,437 --> 00:15:25,636; ;So if it's an existing page pool, dual redundancy is required for drives greater than 2.8 terabytes, okay?
126; ;00:15:25,636 --> 00:15:37,983; ;So again, as a best practice, Dell Storage recommends dual redundancy for any HDDs that are above 1 terabyte, okay?
127; ;00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:48,779; ;All right, so let's look at an example, I'll kind of walk you through an example here to give you an idea of where we can use this chart, where this chart comes into play.
128; ;00:15:48,779 --> 00:16:01,043; ;We'll kind of start with an all-flash array using single redundancy RAID with 1.9 terabyte MRI drives, okay?
129; ;00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:03,898; ;So all drives are in one tier, right?
130; ;00:16:03,898 --> 00:16:05,992; ;That's what we're talking about with AFA.
131; ;00:16:05,992 --> 00:16:19,600; ;So RAID efficiency would be in the 70%-70% range, right, because that one tier is going to be a combination of RAID 10 and the default of RAID 5, which is 5-9.
132; ;00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:24,188; ;So, kind of a combination of 50% to 89% roughly.
133; ;00:16:24,188 --> 00:16:29,781; ;That's where we get that 70% to 77% range because of the combination.
134; ;00:16:29,781 --> 00:16:34,627; ;So, let's say a customer provides you with the desired usable capacity, okay?
135; ;00:16:34,627 --> 00:16:44,110; ;So if they say I want 10 terabytes of usable capacity, then this means you have to add the RAID overhead to the requested usable capacity.
136; ;00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:50,975; ;So in this example of 10 terabytes, we have to add our RAID calculations to this value.
137; ;00:16:50,975 --> 00:16:58,110; ;So, in an SC Series, it would be as follows, right, 20% percent of 10 terabytes is 2 terabytes.
138; ;00:16:58,110 --> 00:17:01,997; ;Right, 80% of 10 terabytes is 8 terabytes, okay.
139; ;00:17:01,997 --> 00:17:03,976; ;Keeping the math simple here.
140; ;00:17:03,976 --> 00:17:20,890; ;If we use the efficiency factors of RAID 10 and RAID 5-9 that we're seeing up here, we can easily calculate the combined overheads as we take 2 terabytes divided by 50%, right?
141; ;00:17:20,890 --> 00:17:23,090; ;And that's the efficiency rate.
142; ;00:17:23,090 --> 00:17:28,059; ;So that's going to be 4 terabytes we're going to need to handle that efficiency.
143; ;00:17:28,059 --> 00:17:34,367; ;And then 8 terabytes, we said is going to be at 89% efficient.
144; ;00:17:34,367 --> 00:17:38,469; ;So that's going to be actually 8.99 terabytes.
145; ;00:17:38,469 --> 00:17:46,368; ;So if we add these values together, we go from 10 terabytes to 12.99 total terabytes.
146; ;00:17:46,368 --> 00:17:48,733; ;Does that make sense?
147; ;00:17:48,733 --> 00:18:03,297; ;Okay, so if we divide the customer's desired capacity of 10 terabytes by the total amount of capacity of RAID overhead, we do get 0.77 if we take 10 terabytes, divide by 12.99.
148; ;00:18:03,297 --> 00:18:13,013; ;Okay, so as we said, 0.77 is the blended RAID or the efficiency factor, as we could call it, of how we estimate a blended RAID.
149; ;00:18:13,013 --> 00:18:27,394; ;This means that in order to achieve 10 terabytes of usable capacity, you have to have greater than or equal to 12.99 terabytes of space to account for RAID overhead in a tier, okay.
150; ;00:18:27,394 --> 00:18:36,089; ;Such that RAID 10 allocation makes up 20% of the capacity and RAID 5-9 makes up 80% of the capacity.
151; ;00:18:36,089 --> 00:18:45,639; ;So that's how you're going to use these RAID calculations to figure out how much actual space is required in a tier.
152; ;00:18:45,639 --> 00:18:49,262; ;And sure we size for tier 3 performance.
153; ;00:18:49,262 --> 00:18:57,576; ;So as we talked about earlier, the main focus of tier 3 is making sure we have plenty of capacity, right?
154; ;00:18:57,576 --> 00:19:00,607; ;But we really can't forget performance in tier 3.
155; ;00:19:00,607 --> 00:19:02,942; ;As it says there, it's often overlooked.
156; ;00:19:02,942 --> 00:19:06,738; ;Yeah, it can be the source of many production reads, so you might have...
157; ;00:19:06,738 --> 00:19:10,030; ;It might be that performance doesn't really matter, right?
158; ;00:19:10,030 --> 00:19:25,052; ;You're getting plenty good performance out of tier 3 drives, even though we're running in tier 3, everybody's happy from a performance standpoint, so let's keep doing production reads into tier 3.
159; ;00:19:25,052 --> 00:19:34,150; ;Now one thing you have to keep in mind as far as making sure there are IOPS on the back-end is some of the background processes.
160; ;00:19:34,150 --> 00:19:47,303; ;Such as data progression and compression and, you know, other processes that are running on the back-end, like encryption, they very often will use tier 3.
161; ;00:19:47,303 --> 00:19:53,058; ;So you have to have those IOPS down in that tier.
162; ;00:19:53,058 --> 00:19:59,729; ;An example is moving infrequently accessed or inaccessible pages from tier 1 down to tier 3.
163; ;00:19:59,729 --> 00:20:04,166; ;Okay, we want to do that as quick as we can so we have to make sure we have IOPS down there.
164; ;00:20:04,166 --> 00:20:07,891; ;Another one that we mentioned earlier was backups, right?
165; ;00:20:07,891 --> 00:20:16,959; ;So if you don't have enough drives in tier 3, that can result in very poor performance for backups, right?
166; ;00:20:16,959 --> 00:20:31,189; ;So, where that comes into play is we have had scenarios where customers actually have worse backup window after they got their SAN than with direct-attached storage.
167; ;00:20:31,189 --> 00:20:32,510; ;Why is that?
168; ;00:20:32,510 --> 00:20:38,014; ;Because the engineer didn't put in enough IOPS down in tier 3.
169; ;00:20:38,014 --> 00:20:48,833; ;So it's very important to keep that in mind as it says there, tier 3 should hold 20% of total IOPS, of the total IOPS potential, okay.
170; ;00:20:48,833 --> 00:20:55,445; ;So again, if you think about some of these sizing things, keep in mind that very often a single tier might even be the best fit.
171; ;00:20:57,358 --> 00:21:05,568; ;So the last preliminary sizing step that we talk about here in this module is a little discussion of thin provisioning.
172; ;00:21:05,568 --> 00:21:09,988; ;So you see the term dynamic capacity there in the parentheses.
173; ;00:21:09,988 --> 00:21:16,298; ;Dynamic capacity is the software term that we use for thin provisioning, right?
174; ;00:21:16,298 --> 00:21:25,349; ;So all of our volumes that are created are thinly provisioned by default, okay?
175; ;00:21:25,349 --> 00:21:30,942; ;Now the significance of this is you don't need to over-design for capacity.
176; ;00:21:30,942 --> 00:21:34,005; ;So what does that mean, don't over-design for capacity?
177; ;00:21:34,005 --> 00:21:45,032; ;Well, that means that because we thin provision volumes that we create, if a SAN, some of the older SANs that don't have thin provisioning.
178; ;00:21:45,032 --> 00:21:56,837; ;Very often, when you went to size a system, you would have to size a whole lot bigger than what they actually needed, right, and the customer actually needed because we're looking at growth potential.
179; ;00:21:56,837 --> 00:22:05,216; ;Or we need to get this many IOPS, we got to make sure that we have enough capacity to handle everything.
180; ;00:22:05,216 --> 00:22:15,226; ;So it's real important that you keep in mind that you don't have to design for that extra capacity that we don't have yet, right?
181; ;00:22:15,226 --> 00:22:23,675; ;So, a good best practice is look at DPACK, be mindful of that utilization rate, okay?
182; ;00:22:23,675 --> 00:22:38,078; ;And look at the utilization rate from DPACK is really a combination of current capacity needs, plus projected growth, plus replay space, okay?
183; ;00:22:38,078 --> 00:22:47,915; ;So, that's a good best practice to keep in mind when you're doing sizing and remembering that thin provisioning is part...
184; ;00:22:47,915 --> 00:22:52,871; ;That's how the SC Series, the Storage Center was built from the ground up.
185; ;00:22:55,218 --> 00:22:58,936; ;This slide shows disk drive considerations and limits.
186; ;00:22:58,936 --> 00:23:02,776; ;And we're going to focus initially on SSD drives.
187; ;00:23:02,776 --> 00:23:04,769; ;Notice the IOs per second.
188; ;00:23:04,769 --> 00:23:08,341; ;The hard disks all have a specific number.
189; ;00:23:08,341 --> 00:23:10,343; ;And even that number can vary a little bit.
190; ;00:23:10,343 --> 00:23:16,136; ;But it's nothing like the range that we see on IOs per second for an SSD drive.
191; ;00:23:16,136 --> 00:23:20,373; ;We have it anywhere from 2,000 to 10,000 IOPS, okay?
192; ;00:23:20,373 --> 00:23:35,728; ;And really, unfortunately, that's about as defined as you can get because there are two huge factors that determine IOPS in SSD environment, and they're block size of the application, and overall throughput.
193; ;00:23:35,728 --> 00:23:39,025; ;Those are the two main things that have to be taken into account.
194; ;00:23:39,025 --> 00:23:46,150; ;Now all storage arrays have a point of saturation in which no additional performance can be obtained, okay?
195; ;00:23:46,150 --> 00:23:50,274; ;And again, the point of that is that can be dependent on many factors.
196; ;00:23:50,274 --> 00:23:57,640; ;So therefore, the number of SSDs used in a design should be primarily based on capacity.
197; ;00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:00,149; ;Okay, that's what that bullet point says there.
198; ;00:24:00,149 --> 00:24:05,611; ;And a performance of the system needs to take into account the IOPS throughout the whole system.
199; ;00:24:08,112 --> 00:24:12,960; ;Now the type of disk drives that are chosen may have very different performance characteristics.
200; ;00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:17,369; ;And here's where these IOPS numbers come into play.
201; ;00:24:17,369 --> 00:24:21,004; ;So these averages are based on well-accepted industry guidelines.
202; ;00:24:21,004 --> 00:24:25,021; ;So there's nothing unique to Dell about these numbers, right?
203; ;00:24:25,021 --> 00:24:27,019; ;They are industry standards.
204; ;00:24:27,019 --> 00:24:38,426; ;Certainly, they're averages, so it will depend on the number of reads versus write, block size from the application, those will certainly affect these IOPS as well, okay?
205; ;00:24:38,426 --> 00:24:44,733; ;And then these IOPS can be delivered through the Storage Center at a latency of less than 20 milliseconds.
206; ;00:24:44,733 --> 00:24:47,071; ;So that's what these numbers really are for.
207; ;00:24:47,071 --> 00:24:55,326; ;And again, keep in mind these are just kind of a guideline for you to help in determining the sizing of a solution.
208; ;00:24:55,326 --> 00:24:59,616; ;So it's time to run through a few review questions here again.
209; ;00:24:59,616 --> 00:25:07,846; ;Our first one, how much snapshot overhead should be calculated when designing an SC Series solution?
210; ;00:25:07,846 --> 00:25:09,434; ;We talked about that.
211; ;00:25:11,012 --> 00:25:12,680; ;Good, 20%.
212; ;00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:14,229; ;Nice.
213; ;00:25:14,229 --> 00:25:21,395; ;Question number two, what is the typical RAID efficiency factor calculated in tier 3?
214; ;00:25:21,395 --> 00:25:22,887; ;Remember what that one was?
215; ;00:25:24,305 --> 00:25:26,514; ;That's 80%, right?
216; ;00:25:26,514 --> 00:25:30,511; ;So you might ask, "Where does that percentage come from?"
217; ;00:25:32,187 --> 00:25:36,789; ;Well that's because typically in tier 3 you have RAID 6-10.
218; ;00:25:36,789 --> 00:25:40,291; ;And RAID 6-10 provides 80% efficiency.
219; ;00:25:40,291 --> 00:25:43,479; ;So that's where that 80% number comes from.
220; ;00:25:43,479 --> 00:25:52,355; ;And then, finally how many IOPS can a 4 terabyte 7.2K drive generate?
221; ;00:25:52,355 --> 00:25:55,114; ;And that's generally around 80 IOPS.
222; ;00:25:55,114 --> 00:26:02,477; ;And remember, that was just from that chart we saw on the previous page, that's just taken from the public domain.
1; ;00:00:02,208 --> 00:00:09,110; ;So as we talk about design philosophy, there are really many different ways to build a system.
2; ;00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:11,900; ;So designing a SAN is like working with building blocks.
3; ;00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:20,092; ;The size, shape, the number of different blocks will differ depending on the project and really can be assembled in any fashion, right?
4; ;00:00:20,092 --> 00:00:24,115; ;The main goal here is that the customer's needs are met.
5; ;00:00:24,115 --> 00:00:34,447; ;So it might be with SSDs, it might be with 15K drives, it might be a single tier of storage, it might be two tiers, it might be flash-optimized.
6; ;00:00:34,447 --> 00:00:38,917; ;So there's a lot of different variables there as far as the design philosophy.
7; ;00:00:38,917 --> 00:00:43,541; ;Certainly, cost obviously is going to enter into that projection as well.
8; ;00:00:43,541 --> 00:00:48,359; ;But knowing the customer's growth rate helps ensure designs that will scale to meet those needs.
9; ;00:00:48,359 --> 00:00:52,612; ;We just talked about the 20% growth projected in.
10; ;00:00:52,612 --> 00:00:54,650; ;But that's a huge part of that.
11; ;00:00:54,650 --> 00:01:02,887; ;So really the first thing that we want to do in any design, right, is to define the targets for IOPS and capacity, right?
12; ;00:01:02,887 --> 00:01:06,833; ;So how we get there might differ.
13; ;00:01:06,833 --> 00:01:11,056; ;Customer IOPS, what does the customer need for IOPS?
14; ;00:01:11,056 --> 00:01:14,381; ;What is the customer looking for for capacity?
15; ;00:01:14,381 --> 00:01:16,908; ;And the IOPS can be gotten from DPACK.
16; ;00:01:16,908 --> 00:01:24,215; ;And the capacity, we can come up with an idea of what the customer wants based on what we're proposing.
17; ;00:01:24,215 --> 00:01:34,671; ;In the last bullet point there, designing to meet the bare minimums could prove costly certainly in terms of support calls, especially if those calls are due to poor performance.
18; ;00:01:34,671 --> 00:01:43,443; ;Not only is the customer unhappy because he has to call in and try to figure out why, but it's a huge burden on the support group as well, right?
19; ;00:01:43,443 --> 00:01:51,024; ;Because they don't know anything about the design philosophy that an engineer put together for this customer.
20; ;00:01:51,024 --> 00:01:55,909; ;So they're sort of grasping at straws to try to get performance improvements.
21; ;00:01:55,909 --> 00:02:00,146; ;So designing for the bare minimums is really, really problematic.
22; ;00:02:03,148 --> 00:02:05,716; ;Let's look at a design example.
23; ;00:02:05,716 --> 00:02:07,253; ;We'll look at a couple different examples.
24; ;00:02:07,253 --> 00:02:13,176; ;But as we look at the first one here kind of hitting a point over and over again here.
25; ;00:02:13,176 --> 00:02:19,187; ;But remember, the main objective is to size for performance.
26; ;00:02:19,187 --> 00:02:25,147; ;And that is meeting the customer's IOP requirements in tier 1, okay?
27; ;00:02:25,147 --> 00:02:26,417; ;Did you notice that bullet there?
28; ;00:02:26,417 --> 00:02:33,710; ;"If the system will deliver enough IOPS in tier 1, future capacity additions will be in tier 3."
29; ;00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:40,899; ;All right, so let's kind of look at a little example here to give you an idea of what we're talking about, okay?
30; ;00:02:40,899 --> 00:02:45,609; ;So in this example, we're sizing for 10,000 IOPS.
31; ;00:02:45,609 --> 00:02:50,221; ;So we can figure a single system should be able to certainly handle 10,000 IOPS.
32; ;00:02:50,221 --> 00:02:54,756; ;So an ideal design for a 10,000 IOPS system...
33; ;00:02:54,756 --> 00:03:00,043; ;Remember, we want 100% of the IOPS in tier 1, okay?
34; ;00:03:00,043 --> 00:03:02,735; ;So 20% of IOPS in tier 3.
35; ;00:03:02,735 --> 00:03:11,497; ;So that is, it might seem a head scratcher on the surface, but remember, we're talking about 20% for growth, okay?
36; ;00:03:11,497 --> 00:03:18,673; ;So that's again, back to this, making sure the customer has the performance requirements, has the IOPS requirements he needs in tier 1.
37; ;00:03:18,673 --> 00:03:26,476; ;So, the ideal design is 100% of IOPS in tier 1 and 20% of IOPS in tier 3.
38; ;00:03:26,476 --> 00:03:36,279; ;So using the math there, 10,000 in tier 1 and 2,000 in tier 3 if we're sizing for 10,000 IOPS, okay?
39; ;00:03:36,279 --> 00:03:41,270; ;Again, now consider what kind of drives work best, right?
40; ;00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:45,186; ;So 15,000 RPM drives.
41; ;00:03:45,186 --> 00:03:54,888; ;The 3.5-inch 15,000 RPM drives, we get this from the chart we just saw a couple slides back delivers about 180 IOPS.
42; ;00:03:54,888 --> 00:04:03,747; ;A 15,000 RPM drive, a 2.5-inch drive delivers about 210 IOPS, okay?
43; ;00:04:03,747 --> 00:04:14,154; ;A 10,000 RPM drive is about 140 IOPS and a 7,200 RPM drive is about 80 IOPS.
44; ;00:04:14,154 --> 00:04:18,460; ;So, remember that, we got that from the chart a moment ago.
45; ;00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:25,106; ;So, if the system delivers enough IOPS in tier 1, remember, future capacity will be in tier 3.
46; ;00:04:25,106 --> 00:04:38,022; ;So therefore, if a system can be designed to deliver 10,000 IOPS in tier 1, while still needing a sufficient number of tier 3 drives to provide at least 20%, that would be ideal.
47; ;00:04:38,022 --> 00:04:42,692; ;Remember we talked about you need some IOPS down in tier 3?
48; ;00:04:42,692 --> 00:04:54,945; ;So if we start by selecting the 2.5-inch 15,000 RPM drives, remember, we just said it's 210 IOPS per drive, okay?
49; ;00:04:54,945 --> 00:05:05,013; ;That would mean using about 48 active spindles, 15K spindles to get 10,000 IOPS, okay?
50; ;00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:15,246; ;So to determine the size of those drives, consider how many tier 3 drives will be used and how close the system is to target capacity, okay?
51; ;00:05:15,246 --> 00:05:25,602; ;So again, to allow about 2,000 IOPS in tier 3, the system will need to have approximately 25 7,200 RPM drives.
52; ;00:05:25,602 --> 00:05:30,208; ;Remember, we have the slower drives down in tier, okay?
53; ;00:05:30,208 --> 00:05:31,244; ;So this gives you the...
54; ;00:05:31,244 --> 00:05:35,356; ;Kind of doing the math there on that last bullet, right?
55; ;00:05:37,068 --> 00:05:39,096; ;Let's continue on with this example.
56; ;00:05:39,096 --> 00:05:44,147; ;So we designed for the IOPS needed on the last slide.
57; ;00:05:44,147 --> 00:05:49,369; ;So, now let's design from a capacity standpoint, okay?
58; ;00:05:49,369 --> 00:05:54,161; ;So, we want to meet the customer's capacity requirements.
59; ;00:05:54,161 --> 00:06:01,925; ;And let's say the customer has requested 48 terabytes, okay?
60; ;00:06:01,925 --> 00:06:04,764; ;So let's take the example here again.
61; ;00:06:04,764 --> 00:06:08,683; ;We're going to kind of piggyback on the same example we had on the previous slide.
62; ;00:06:08,683 --> 00:06:17,982; ;So sizing for 48 terabytes, right, that number comes from the fact that the customer said that's what he's looking for, 48 terabytes of usable space.
63; ;00:06:17,982 --> 00:06:25,561; ;Now the 80:20 read/write ratio, that's coming from a DPACK, okay?
64; ;00:06:25,561 --> 00:06:29,653; ;So we got a DPACK analysis of the customer environment, that's what we came back with.
65; ;00:06:29,653 --> 00:06:38,447; ;Now the customer says he wants 48 terabytes, we're going to add 20% for Data Instant Replay, okay?
66; ;00:06:38,447 --> 00:06:47,780; ;So we really don't know, we don't have a lot of insight into how often replays will be taken or how long they're going to keep those replays and how many changes they have.
67; ;00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:52,058; ;So that's why that 20% is a good kind of ballpark.
68; ;00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,640; ;So that's where the 9.6 terabytes comes from, adding on to the 48 terabyte request that the customer gave us, okay?
69; ;00:06:59,646 --> 00:07:11,844; ;So that 9.6 terabytes, the plan is to go down in tier 3, right, that was that whole plan of I want replays to be calculated into tier 3, okay?
70; ;00:07:11,844 --> 00:07:14,648; ;Now a couple of other assumptions will be made here.
71; ;00:07:14,648 --> 00:07:20,219; ;We're going to assume tier 1 data will be a combination of RAID 10 and RAID 5-9.
72; ;00:07:20,219 --> 00:07:24,311; ;So that would be single redundancy, okay?
73; ;00:07:24,311 --> 00:07:31,042; ;So, remember, we had from the DPACK, we said 80:20 read/write ratio.
74; ;00:07:31,042 --> 00:07:38,611; ;So that's going to be 20% RAID 10 and 80% RAID 5-9, okay?
75; ;00:07:38,611 --> 00:07:42,847; ;So in tier 1, we're going to have RAID 10 and RAID 5-9.
76; ;00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:49,266; ;Data in tier 3 is going to be RAID 6-10, right?
77; ;00:07:49,266 --> 00:07:58,847; ;So data in tier 1 will be split between, so we're talking about here, 20% RAID 10 and 80% RAID 5-9, okay?
78; ;00:08:00,305 --> 00:08:08,381; ;Just rounding this figure up, we'll have 10 terabytes of replay space to be allocated into tier 3, okay?
79; ;00:08:08,381 --> 00:08:11,405; ;So given all that information with...
80; ;00:08:11,405 --> 00:08:26,725; ;If I've got 146 15K drives, right, and again, we are just sort of, you know, examining this, the yield is about 5.65 terabytes of usable space, okay?
81; ;00:08:26,725 --> 00:08:31,917; ;That's only about half of what the customer is looking for in tier 1, okay?
82; ;00:08:31,917 --> 00:08:35,251; ;So let's go back to the drawing board, look at this, how about 300 gig?
83; ;00:08:35,251 --> 00:08:43,384; ;Let's go from a 146 gig, we have the option of 300 gig 15K drives, okay?
84; ;00:08:43,384 --> 00:08:49,998; ;Seems to be a lot better option because it's going to supply about 11.56 terabytes of space.
85; ;00:08:49,998 --> 00:08:52,544; ;This is in tier 1, okay?
86; ;00:08:52,544 --> 00:08:58,539; ;So this is in that 20% to 30% range that's ideal, okay?
87; ;00:08:58,539 --> 00:09:13,772; ;Remember, it's better to have more space in tier 1 than that's needed 'cause if the system runs out of tier 1 space, it will have a major impact on performance because the performance is going to be taken from tier 3, right?
88; ;00:09:13,772 --> 00:09:23,030; ;Okay, so we've now selected the tier 1 drive, the 300 gig, 15K RPM drives, now it's time to look at the tier 3 drive that we need, okay?
89; ;00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:31,646; ;So we need 58 terabytes, 58 total terabytes, 48 and 10, okay?
90; ;00:09:31,646 --> 00:09:44,604; ;If we subtract the 11.56, we just are seeing in tier 1, an additional 46.44 terabytes of space is needed, okay?
91; ;00:09:44,604 --> 00:09:58,783; ;So just fairly straightforward math there, by selecting 2.5-inch 7,200 RPM 1 terabyte drives.
92; ;00:09:58,783 --> 00:10:07,179; ;25 drives would be provided, okay?
93; ;00:10:07,179 --> 00:10:27,059; ;All right, so looking at that again, if I selected the 2.5-inch 1 terabyte 7,200 RPM drives, okay, 24 drives will provide about 18.19 terabytes of usable space after RAID overhead.
94; ;00:10:27,059 --> 00:10:34,760; ;This is still short of that 46.44 target that we have, okay?
95; ;00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:45,649; ;Therefore the number of drives needed for capacity is 64 'cause this will get us over that 46.44 terabyte target, okay?
96; ;00:10:45,649 --> 00:10:51,747; ;So that's where this option comes in, the 58.48 terabyte, okay?
97; ;00:10:51,747 --> 00:10:56,943; ;So that is very close to our total target of 58 terabytes, okay?
98; ;00:10:56,943 --> 00:10:58,831; ;Now again, because of the...
99; ;00:10:58,831 --> 00:11:07,818; ;You have a lot of different options there that these drives that we just put in, they may or may not be the most cost effective solutions, okay?
100; ;00:11:07,818 --> 00:11:14,403; ;So it might be different drives, it might provide different costs, and that's why you have to kind of look at each of them, okay?
101; ;00:11:14,403 --> 00:11:18,706; ;And this is where a sizing tool comes in handy.
102; ;00:11:18,706 --> 00:11:24,618; ;So these selections were chosen due to the fact that they are all 2.5-inch form factor.
103; ;00:11:24,618 --> 00:11:30,803; ;And the 15K drives filled exactly two enclosures with no room for spares, okay?
104; ;00:11:30,803 --> 00:11:40,638; ;Given the cost of the extra enclosures that would be needed if tier 3 was to use 3.5-inch form factors, that's why we went with the 2.5-inch form factors, okay?
105; ;00:11:40,638 --> 00:11:52,887; ;So again, just to give you an idea of how this works but also all of the different ways, you've got so much flexibility in how to design.
106; ;00:11:52,887 --> 00:11:59,745; ;But this hopefully will kind of give you an idea of how to go about sizing for capacity.
107; ;00:11:59,745 --> 00:12:14,206; ;With the release of deduplication in SCOS 7.0, there were some preconceived notions that customers can automatically purchase less capacity because of these features working together.
108; ;00:12:14,206 --> 00:12:21,584; ;For some, this may be true but only if they have a thorough understanding of the data sets they need to store.
109; ;00:12:21,584 --> 00:12:26,505; ;This comes from understanding their application data, right, and general file sets.
110; ;00:12:26,505 --> 00:12:33,759; ;Without having this data, it's at best to guess to try to figure out what dedupe and compression are going to do.
111; ;00:12:33,759 --> 00:12:42,027; ;Keep in mind that data varies by customer and results will vary even by customer within their own data sets, right?
112; ;00:12:42,027 --> 00:12:47,852; ;As an example, VDI workloads are very compressible compared to videos which are not.
113; ;00:12:47,852 --> 00:12:53,442; ;So that's why if you think about the customer, do they have more videos, do they have a VDI environment.
114; ;00:12:53,442 --> 00:13:02,748; ;So even within a customer, it's going to depend on what data is stored where, so what kind of impact compression and dedupe is actually going to have.
115; ;00:13:02,748 --> 00:13:08,933; ;So really, they're data reduction techniques designed to save money, right?
116; ;00:13:08,933 --> 00:13:19,166; ;However, the thing to kind of take away from those two features is we want to stick with our philosophy to size for performance first and capacity second.
1; ;00:00:01,556 --> 00:00:07,057; ;What do you think is step one in the process of sizing an SC Series solution?
2; ;00:00:07,057 --> 00:00:15,775; ;As you might guess, this next section coming up here is going to look at some of the steps involved in determining the sizing.
3; ;00:00:15,775 --> 00:00:21,133; ;So our answer here is, gather and interpret customer performance requirements.
4; ;00:00:21,133 --> 00:00:25,042; ;If you step back and think about it, you go, "Yeah, that kind of makes sense." Right?
5; ;00:00:25,042 --> 00:00:28,963; ;You have to get the requirements first before you can go forward.
6; ;00:00:28,963 --> 00:00:35,559; ;So let's look at process step by step and what's involved in sizing.
7; ;00:00:35,559 --> 00:00:47,014; ;So, there are really five different sizing steps that we're going to take a look at, so the first one is gather and interpret customer performance requirements.
8; ;00:00:48,471 --> 00:01:05,497; ;We're going to design first to meet the IOPS needed, fill in Tier 3 to meet the capacity needs, determine the number and type of front-end connections required, and determine the number of back-end connections required.
9; ;00:01:07,727 --> 00:01:12,934; ;So we're going to start by gather and interpret customer performance requirements.
10; ;00:01:15,016 --> 00:01:17,172; ;So data gathering.
11; ;00:01:17,172 --> 00:01:21,756; ;Now, as we've said, there are many methods of data gathering, okay?
12; ;00:01:21,756 --> 00:01:28,234; ;Really the choice of how you get this information is really on a personal preference, okay?
13; ;00:01:28,234 --> 00:01:35,474; ;Here are some of the things that you're going to need to make sure to keep an eye on, and that is determine the acceptable latency.
14; ;00:01:35,474 --> 00:01:40,697; ;As much as anything, this might be something that comes from the customer, okay?
15; ;00:01:43,804 --> 00:01:48,720; ;Load is measured in terms of IOPS, right?
16; ;00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:53,415; ;Throughput is measured in terms of megabytes per second.
17; ;00:01:53,415 --> 00:01:56,600; ;Okay, those are a couple of terms that you want to keep in mind.
18; ;00:01:56,600 --> 00:02:01,349; ;Load equates to IOPS and throughput equates to...
19; ;00:02:01,349 --> 00:02:02,853; ;Okay, let me bring up this here.
20; ;00:02:02,853 --> 00:02:04,372; ;So, this is what we're talking about.
21; ;00:02:04,372 --> 00:02:11,325; ;Load is measured in terms of IOPS, throughput is measured in terms of megabytes, okay?
22; ;00:02:11,325 --> 00:02:18,250; ;So performance expectation, very often, is based on latency, okay?
23; ;00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:22,386; ;Front-end IOPS can help gauge the maximum back-end load.
24; ;00:02:24,732 --> 00:02:29,004; ;Okay, and then couple of defaults in the SC Series.
25; ;00:02:29,004 --> 00:02:36,601; ;Writes go to Tier 1 at RAID 10 or RAID 10 dual mirror depending if you have single or dual redundancy.
26; ;00:02:36,601 --> 00:02:43,933; ;And you'll always use 2x factor for write IOs, right, because we are dualing data and then mirror, right?
27; ;00:02:43,933 --> 00:02:49,428; ;So that's like two writes there when we're writing into Tier 1, okay?
28; ;00:02:50,967 --> 00:02:56,643; ;So it's real critical that you're looking, here's a good point here.
29; ;00:02:56,643 --> 00:03:02,013; ;When you're sizing, if you're sizing below peak when the sample time is done in seconds.
30; ;00:03:02,013 --> 00:03:08,608; ;Now, again, very often, when we're sizing for an SC Series, we're going to be using Dell's DPACK tool.
31; ;00:03:08,608 --> 00:03:13,599; ;And we're going to talk, we've got some slides coming up to talk a little more about DPACK.
32; ;00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:26,102; ;But that isn't the only tool you can use, but if you're using DPACK, you want to size below peak when the sample time is in seconds, size to peak when the sample time is in minutes.
33; ;00:03:27,123 --> 00:03:29,209; ;And so these are some of the things to keep in mind.
34; ;00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:37,100; ;Always investigate sustained IO spikes, are they caused by backups, is it caused by, you know, highly sequential IO.
35; ;00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:43,804; ;Remember, when we're sizing with an SC Series, we're looking at random IO, okay?
36; ;00:03:45,069 --> 00:03:50,182; ;And certainly different applications will have different performance expectations, right?
37; ;00:03:50,182 --> 00:04:00,506; ;There's an example, if I'm doing Microsoft Exchange, it requires less than 20 milliseconds of latency on database volumes.
38; ;00:04:00,506 --> 00:04:07,247; ;And write latency on transaction log volumes has to be less than 10 milliseconds, okay?
39; ;00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:15,355; ;So, whichever method you use, whether it's DPACK or something else, you really want to look for the same type of information, okay?
40; ;00:04:18,853 --> 00:04:23,688; ;So let's run through a couple of review questions here covering the last few slides that we talked about.
41; ;00:04:23,688 --> 00:04:33,248; ;If capacity needs to be added, let's say, six months after we've already done an installation of a multi-tier SC system, what tier are those drives added to?
42; ;00:04:34,935 --> 00:04:36,355; ;Yep, you probably know that one.
43; ;00:04:36,355 --> 00:04:38,089; ;Tier 3. Good.
44; ;00:04:39,406 --> 00:04:46,141; ;How about six months after initial installation, I want more performance, what tier are those drives added to?
45; ;00:04:47,343 --> 00:04:48,722; ;Yep.
46; ;00:04:48,722 --> 00:04:50,544; ;Tier 1. Good.
47; ;00:04:52,223 --> 00:04:57,316; ;So why is it not a good idea to size an SC Series to the bare minimums?
48; ;00:04:57,316 --> 00:04:59,395; ;Well, we talked about this earlier.
49; ;00:04:59,395 --> 00:05:07,214; ;The customer is not going to be happy if their system grows and this will generate multiple support calls because of poor performance.
50; ;00:05:07,214 --> 00:05:12,699; ;And as we said, it's going to be difficult for the support folks to troubleshoot these issues.
51; ;00:05:12,699 --> 00:05:17,216; ;And certainly, the customer is probably not going to want to hear what the support people have to say.
52; ;00:05:17,216 --> 00:05:19,553; ;So, good.
53; ;00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:22,766; ;All right, discussion question here.
54; ;00:05:22,766 --> 00:05:28,212; ;What Dell tool is an important part of sizing an SC Series solution properly?
55; ;00:05:28,212 --> 00:05:31,551; ;All right, so we talked about this already. DPACK.
56; ;00:05:31,551 --> 00:05:34,894; ;We're going to talk a little bit more about DPACK here in the next few slides.
57; ;00:05:34,894 --> 00:05:40,126; ;But let's define what it is, right?
58; ;00:05:40,126 --> 00:05:44,892; ;So DPACK stands for Dell Performance Analysis Kit.
59; ;00:05:44,892 --> 00:05:53,140; ;Okay, it is a no cost workload performance analysis tool from Dell using open standards.
60; ;00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:53,868; ;Well, the significance of the open standards is that this is actually can be used in any environment.
Okay, it is a no cost workload performance analysis tool from Dell using open standards.
61; ;00:05:53,868 --> 00:06:03,320; ;Well, the significance of the open standards is that this is actually can be used in any environment.
62; ;00:06:03,323 --> 00:06:15,175; ;So we often see even systems that might have some other type of storage vendor in it, we use DPACK to try to analyze the sizing of their performance tool, okay?
63; ;00:06:15,175 --> 00:06:25,032; ;It's a highly interactive web interface takes advantage of HTML 5, so you can look at the tool from any device.
64; ;00:06:25,032 --> 00:06:28,459; ;Data is transmitted in near real-time, okay?
65; ;00:06:28,459 --> 00:06:36,555; ;So it's a lightweight, remote, agent-less tool, okay?
66; ;00:06:36,555 --> 00:06:44,465; ;The current revision of DPACK, and DPACK is constantly going through updates, right, so DPACK 2 is the current version.
67; ;00:06:44,465 --> 00:06:52,206; ;There is training available for DPACK 2, online-based training if you need to learn a little bit more about it.
68; ;00:06:52,206 --> 00:07:04,329; ;But it's very critical, really a critical piece in determining what size a customer's SC Series array at.
69; ;00:07:06,746 --> 00:07:22,526; ;So as we look at DPACK analysis, it's really a good idea to have DPACK record a system, a customer's environment for multiple days, right, rather than just a consistent period of time.
70; ;00:07:22,526 --> 00:07:27,330; ;Very often we hear, "We want to wait until the end of the month to capture a process."
71; ;00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:38,286; ;The problem is this process very likely is just a subset or likely overshadowed by different maintenance activities, backup, and other maintenance things that occur throughout the month.
72; ;00:07:38,286 --> 00:07:57,670; ;So instead of waiting for that end-of-month period, run a 24-hour collection, you know, and just continue on from a salesperson point of view, from a Dell salesperson slant, just keep working the sales processes you normally would.
73; ;00:07:57,670 --> 00:08:10,730; ;But again, try to run and try to get another DPACK for another 24, you know, you might do it three or four times, three or four different days in a month, perhaps, even longer periods of time if you need to.
74; ;00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:14,890; ;But I wouldn't put it on a particular set period of time.
75; ;00:08:14,890 --> 00:08:20,637; ;It's not going to give you an accurate reflection of what's happening in the environment on a continual basis.
76; ;00:08:23,526 --> 00:08:26,795; ;Okay, so we've gathered up the information with DPACK.
77; ;00:08:26,795 --> 00:08:30,569; ;Our next step of the process is the actual design.
78; ;00:08:30,569 --> 00:08:34,943; ;So remember, we want to design first to meet the IOPS needed.
79; ;00:08:34,943 --> 00:08:37,653; ;So this is almost by way of review.
80; ;00:08:37,653 --> 00:08:43,153; ;When designing Tier 1 for the IOPS load, what are some things to kind of keep in mind?
81; ;00:08:44,969 --> 00:08:47,256; ;You will hit these coming up here, but...
82; ;00:08:48,500 --> 00:09:01,063; ;Yep, couple of things, total IOPS needed, average IO size, it's the block size, read versus write ratio, and expected growth, right?
83; ;00:09:01,063 --> 00:09:09,136; ;These are all things that you want to keep in mind when you're sizing for the load in Tier 1.
84; ;00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:23,070; ;Okay, so adjust the IOPS for RAID and read-write ratio, then size Tier 1 for the IOPS and the remaining capacity goes into Tier 3.
85; ;00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:24,588; ;We've talked a lot about that.
86; ;00:09:24,588 --> 00:09:29,739; ;Again, this whole idea of making sure that you're sizing for a Tier 1 first.
87; ;00:09:29,739 --> 00:09:33,602; ;Apply the read-write ratio to the IOPS requirements, okay?
88; ;00:09:33,602 --> 00:09:38,770; ;That's going to come typically from DPACK or some other tool used for gathering.
89; ;00:09:39,842 --> 00:09:47,808; ;Okay, remember, you want to multiply the write IOPS by two to take into account that RAID overhead, okay?
90; ;00:09:47,808 --> 00:09:51,493; ;Now this is, remember, single redundancy.
91; ;00:09:51,493 --> 00:10:00,082; ;If it's dual redundancy, you need to multiply the write IOPS by 3 for RAID 10 DM.
92; ;00:10:00,082 --> 00:10:04,736; ;Okay, so we're just looking at single redundancy in this case, so it would be multiply the write IOPS by 2.
93; ;00:10:07,204 --> 00:10:12,391; ;Okay? Then add read IOPS for total adjusted back-end IOPS.
94; ;00:10:12,391 --> 00:10:21,304; ;Again, you're getting all of this from that ratio that came from DPACK, again, showing the value, the critical nature of DPACK.
95; ;00:10:22,748 --> 00:10:34,218; ;Okay, as we said, you want to make sure in size Tier 1 for 100% of the adjusted IOPS, again, by adjusted, we're talking about the RAID 10, okay?
96; ;00:10:36,708 --> 00:10:40,379; ;Determine the capacity of Tier 1 after sizing for IOPS.
97; ;00:10:40,379 --> 00:10:45,398; ;So you've already sized for IOPS, now let's figure out the capacity that we need.
98; ;00:10:48,141 --> 00:10:50,909; ;Size Tier 3 for whatever's left over.
99; ;00:10:53,782 --> 00:11:03,109; ;Okay, so, kind of, as a rule of thumb, the capacity split between Tier 1 and Tier 3 should be approximately match the read-write ratio.
100; ;00:11:03,109 --> 00:11:15,734; ;Okay, so as an example here, if that read-write ratio coming from DPACK is 80:20, otherwise, 80% read, 20% write, that's typical environment.
101; ;00:11:15,734 --> 00:11:25,692; ;So how we'd want to size for capacity, then is 20% of the capacity should be in Tier 1 and the 80% should be in Tier 3.
102; ;00:11:27,133 --> 00:11:36,857; ;Okay, so using that read-write ratio in reverse to come up with the capacity necessary if I've got a two tier solution.
103; ;00:11:38,804 --> 00:11:43,400; ;Okay, so let's take a look at an example then of gathering IOPS.
104; ;00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:51,443; ;So this is a graph that we would have obtained from a sizing tool as we were gathering our information, right?
105; ;00:11:51,443 --> 00:11:56,037; ;So what this is telling us, let's just kind of take a look at... We've highlighted a few data points on here.
106; ;00:11:56,037 --> 00:12:00,720; ;So let's say at 9 pm, obviously you can tell this is a 24-hour graph, okay?
107; ;00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,933; ;Total IOPS are in blue, the yellow line is reads, and the red is writes.
So let's say at 9 pm, obviously you can tell this is a 24-hour graph, okay?
108; ;00:12:01,933 --> 00:12:11,190; ;Total IOPS are in blue, the yellow line is reads, and the red is writes.
109; ;00:12:11,197 --> 00:12:17,651; ;Okay, so at 9 o'clock, our front-end IOPS is 6,200, right about that.
110; ;00:12:17,651 --> 00:12:25,290; ;And that's comprised of 2,600 writes which we're seeing here, and 3,600 reads, okay?
111; ;00:12:26,669 --> 00:12:40,201; ;Now then at about 4 am, there is a front-end peak, right just shy of 6,000 IOPS, about 5,900 IOPS, with 4, 000 writes.
112; ;00:12:40,201 --> 00:12:44,240; ;Okay, so huge spike in writes and 1,900 reads.
113; ;00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:50,455; ;Okay, so if I'm factoring in the write penalty for these times, remember the write penalty is times 2.
114; ;00:12:50,455 --> 00:12:59,873; ;So I've got 2,600 here, times 2, plus 3,600 equals 8,800, right?
115; ;00:12:59,873 --> 00:13:02,633; ;So there is where the write penalty comes in.
116; ;00:13:03,864 --> 00:13:11,449; ;And then I've got the 4 am time, 4,000 times 2, okay?
117; ;00:13:11,449 --> 00:13:19,591; ;Plus the 1,900, right here, just shy of 2,000, you get 9,900 IOPS.
118; ;00:13:21,506 --> 00:13:24,943; ;Sorry. You get 9,900 IOPS, okay?
119; ;00:13:24,943 --> 00:13:27,927; ;These are points in time on which to focus.
120; ;00:13:29,234 --> 00:13:40,631; ;Okay, so this is where, again, one of the keys here is this is a good time to have a discussion with the customer about what's going on at 9 pm and 4 am.
121; ;00:13:40,631 --> 00:13:42,403; ;Are there mission critical apps going on?
122; ;00:13:42,403 --> 00:13:45,461; ;Are there backups going on, is there something else?
123; ;00:13:45,461 --> 00:13:56,563; ;And so, again, it's critical to understand the customer's environment and how important performance is and the critical nature of performance, that's imperative.
124; ;00:13:56,563 --> 00:14:02,922; ;So in this example, the target design is for approximately 10,000 IOPS on the back-end.
125; ;00:14:04,183 --> 00:14:15,793; ;So in this example, this is customer performance data that came from just a generic graph resulting from a third party data gathering tool, wasn't necessarily DPACK, right?
126; ;00:14:15,793 --> 00:14:24,459; ;Now one of the nice things about DPACK is it simplifies the analysis by providing a summary report, okay?
127; ;00:14:24,459 --> 00:14:34,921; ;So here you'll notice the summary report includes IOPS at peak as well as the IOPS at 95 percentile, also gives you the read-write ratio.
128; ;00:14:36,304 --> 00:14:45,823; ;Okay, so the same conversation needs to happen with the customer regarding the business drivers behind the delta between 95% and peak.
129; ;00:14:45,823 --> 00:14:53,027; ;So that's quite a significant difference there between 95% and peak, so you just want to have a discussion as to why that is.
130; ;00:14:53,027 --> 00:14:55,385; ;So this is the summary.
131; ;00:14:55,385 --> 00:15:00,426; ;Then from here, you can also break down individual servers, right?
132; ;00:15:00,426 --> 00:15:13,031; ;So this is another way of using this tool to try to analyze and figure out where the peaks are and what is the difference, okay?
133; ;00:15:14,814 --> 00:15:18,672; ;All right, this chart should look familiar to you.
134; ;00:15:18,672 --> 00:15:20,313; ;It's got the drive IOPS chart.
135; ;00:15:20,313 --> 00:15:28,951; ;The one difference here is we look at 50/50 read-write ratio and these are more actual numbers than we had seen before.
136; ;00:15:28,951 --> 00:15:41,267; ;But we want to just show this here because we want to look at the calculation that's involved with figuring out how many drives we need based on our IOPS that we need, okay?
137; ;00:15:41,267 --> 00:15:52,271; ;So what you want to do is, you divide the customer's adjusted IOPS, and remember adjusted IOPS would be the case of RAID 10 writes, that's two IOPS,
138; ;00:15:52,271 --> 00:15:59,265; ;But divide the customer's adjusted IOPS by the drive IOPS that you see on this chart here, okay?
139; ;00:15:59,265 --> 00:16:03,433; ;To determine how many drives are required to provide the needed performance.
140; ;00:16:04,825 --> 00:16:14,568; ;Okay, then you multiply the number of drives that we needed, that we came up with on the previous step, by the drive capacity listed,
141; ;00:16:14,568 --> 00:16:20,438; ;You know, to determine the overall, to determine the raw capacity that is necessary.
142; ;00:16:20,438 --> 00:16:30,605; ;Then you would adjust the drive type, drive count, and drive capacity until you meet the required IOPS and as well as the capacity.
143; ;00:16:30,605 --> 00:16:43,382; ;Okay, so this chart can be a great resource, but again, it's based on, you know, 50/50 read-write percent that may not be what DPACK tells us that the customer's environment is.
144; ;00:16:43,382 --> 00:16:50,468; ;So I'm going to give you a calculation here, that's actually a little bit more exact.
145; ;00:16:51,479 --> 00:16:55,633; ;To get a more defined result, let's use this calculation here.
146; ;00:16:55,633 --> 00:17:07,609; ;So you take the write seek time times the write percent, you add the read seek time times the read percent, plus the rotational latency.
147; ;00:17:09,322 --> 00:17:15,509; ;Okay, so whatever that result is you take 1 divided by that result, okay.
148; ;00:17:15,509 --> 00:17:28,316; ;And that will actually provide an IOPS number, that's more accurate, you know, for an individual customer's solution because it's going to take their environment into the calculation.
149; ;00:17:28,316 --> 00:17:42,681; ;Okay, so some of those numbers that I mentioned in that calculation, write seek, and read seek, rotational latency, all those things can be found on the drive manufacturer's website, okay?
150; ;00:17:42,681 --> 00:17:57,778; ;So, again, some of these calculations certainly they can be done manually, some people will use a spreadsheet, there's also online disk calculators, and we'll show you where you can get the online disk calculators later on in this module.
151; ;00:18:01,544 --> 00:18:04,763; ;So let's finish up our discussion about designing for IOPS.
152; ;00:18:04,763 --> 00:18:13,981; ;We're going to go back to this example, if you remember this example had ended up targeting 10,000 back-end IOPS.
153; ;00:18:13,981 --> 00:18:18,691; ;Okay, so to meet those 10,000 back-end IOPS.
154; ;00:18:18,691 --> 00:18:31,525; ;What we need is to look at our chart here and kind of determine how we can best deliver those IOPS in Tier 1, and, again, of course, later on, we'll have capacity growing to Tier 3.
155; ;00:18:31,525 --> 00:18:37,833; ;So if you were to start, for example, by taking the 2.5-inch 15,000 RPM drives.
156; ;00:18:37,833 --> 00:18:51,997; ;As we see they deliver approximately 206 IOPS, 206, 210 right in there, that would mean about 48 active spindles to get 10,000 IOPS.
157; ;00:18:51,997 --> 00:19:02,562; ;So to determine the size of the drives, consider how many Tier 3 drives will be used and how close the system is to the target capacity, okay?
158; ;00:19:02,562 --> 00:19:15,503; ;So to allow for another 2,000 IOPS in Tier 3, back to our original example, the system will need to have approximately 25, 7,200 RPM drives.
159; ;00:19:17,610 --> 00:19:19,142; ;Okay?
160; ;00:19:19,142 --> 00:19:35,425; ;So again, when you're to kind of sum up our design Tier 1 for IOPS load, you want to consider the total IOPS needed, the average size of the IOPS, the number of reads versus writes, and the expected growth rate.
161; ;00:19:35,425 --> 00:19:40,467; ;So taking all of those together will help get you an...
162; ;00:19:41,588 --> 00:19:50,706; ;It gets as close as possible, let's put it that way, to a proper number of IOPS to get the proper amount of performance from Tier 1.
163; ;00:19:53,372 --> 00:19:55,900; ;All right, let's take a look at a couple review questions here.
164; ;00:19:58,841 --> 00:20:04,998; ;Designing Tier 1 for an SC Series for the proper load means designing for what?
165; ;00:20:04,998 --> 00:20:07,407; ;All right, so what does load refer to?
166; ;00:20:07,407 --> 00:20:08,738; ;IOPS, right?
167; ;00:20:08,738 --> 00:20:10,575; ;Yep. Good.
168; ;00:20:10,575 --> 00:20:15,088; ;What data collection tool is lightweight, remote, and agent-less?
169; ;00:20:16,395 --> 00:20:18,737; ;And this should be an easy one. DPACK.
170; ;00:20:20,279 --> 00:20:26,583; ;A 75:25 read-write ratio means what percent of capacity should be in Tier 3?
171; ;00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:29,367; ;Remember that one?
172; ;00:20:30,376 --> 00:20:33,070; ;Seventy five percent, right? Good.
173; ;00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:34,661; ;Yeah. That's correct.
174; ;00:20:36,875 --> 00:20:42,282; ;All right, as we get into the next section here, let's start with a discussion.
175; ;00:20:42,282 --> 00:20:46,176; ;When sizing Tier 3, what is the main consideration?
176; ;00:20:48,805 --> 00:20:49,843; ;Capacity, right?
177; ;00:20:49,843 --> 00:20:50,846; ;Yep.
178; ;00:20:50,846 --> 00:20:53,229; ;That's the main thing you want to be concerned with in Tier 3.
179; ;00:20:55,569 --> 00:21:01,442; ;So our next sizing step is to fill in Tier 3 to meet the capacity needs.
180; ;00:21:01,442 --> 00:21:04,448; ;Okay, we'll look at what's all involved with that.
181; ;00:21:04,448 --> 00:21:09,239; ;So as we said, Tier 3 we want to size for capacity, okay?
182; ;00:21:10,515 --> 00:21:18,499; ;So our next objective, after we've got the proper performance, we want to make sure we have the right capacity, right?
183; ;00:21:18,499 --> 00:21:31,231; ;So, you know, a couple of things to meet the capacity, to try to figure out how much capacity they need is the customer's current usable capacity, right?
184; ;00:21:31,231 --> 00:21:34,711; ;What's the customer's current use capacity?
185; ;00:21:34,711 --> 00:21:41,400; ;What are they looking at in terms of snapshots, as we call them replays, and what is the expected growth?
186; ;00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:41,951; ;Alright, so we're going to get this information, you know, ideally from the customer.
What are they looking at in terms of snapshots, as we call them replays, and what is the expected growth?
187; ;00:21:41,951 --> 00:21:45,660; ;Alright, so we're going to get this information, you know, ideally from the customer.
188; ;00:21:45,665 --> 00:21:54,552; ;Hopefully, we can get as good of a guess as, you know, as we can get very often, that's the best thing that we can hope for, it's just kind of a swag, okay?
189; ;00:21:56,031 --> 00:22:02,488; ;So in our example here, kind of building on what we had talked about earlier on some earlier slides.
190; ;00:22:02,488 --> 00:22:09,754; ;If you remember what we said, the customer has specified the desire to have at least 48 terabytes of usable space.
191; ;00:22:09,754 --> 00:22:19,105; ;And as we said, there also needs to be room to allow for replay space, so that took us up to 58 terabytes.
192; ;00:22:19,105 --> 00:22:24,520; ;Basing it on 20% growth rate would guess, if you recall...
193; ;00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:35,610; ;Sorry, 20% change rate which means replays, that's going to add 9.6 terabytes, so that's what got us up to our 58 terabytes.
194; ;00:22:35,610 --> 00:22:50,689; ;Okay, now again, we're not sure what the growth rate is but, again, we're thinking 20% there as well, so we'll add an additional 9.6 terabytes, so now we're up to 68 terabytes total, okay?
195; ;00:22:50,689 --> 00:22:57,525; ;So those are some assumptions that we're making, 20% growth rate and 20% change rate.
196; ;00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:11,735; ;And based on that, we're going to look at how the system treats information, sort of back-end information if you will, RAID overhead, for example.
197; ;00:23:11,735 --> 00:23:22,542; ;So data in Tier 1 will be RAID 10 and RAID 5-9 using single redundancy or RAID 10 dual mirror and RAID 6-10.
198; ;00:23:23,814 --> 00:23:26,520; ;Okay, now these are using the recommended what...
199; ;00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:31,097; ;This is a picture of, if you haven't seen it, this is a storage profile.
200; ;00:23:31,097 --> 00:23:40,448; ;And we're basing the information on RAID here based on the recommended storage profile.
201; ;00:23:40,448 --> 00:23:43,855; ;And most of our customers use the recommended storage profile.
202; ;00:23:44,873 --> 00:23:45,897; ;Right.
203; ;00:23:45,897 --> 00:23:56,293; ;Not everybody, again, but probably 75% to 80% of our customers use the recommended storage profile and this is what the recommended storage profile means.
204; ;00:23:56,293 --> 00:24:01,965; ;And that is the data in Tier 3, it's going to be RAID 6-10, that's dual redundancy.
205; ;00:24:03,553 --> 00:24:10,313; ;Data in Tier 1 will be typically split between RAID 10 and 5-9 or RAID 10 dual mirror and 6-10.
206; ;00:24:10,313 --> 00:24:19,009; ;And this is going to be based on the read-write percent and remember the replay space is calculated in Tier 3
207; ;00:24:19,009 --> 00:24:31,146; ;So that 20 terabytes of growth space that we talked about, the 20 terabytes of replay space, majority is going to be allocated into Tier 3, especially the replay space for sure.
208; ;00:24:31,146 --> 00:24:37,499; ;The growth space, some of that can be in Tier 1 but we'll just figure 20 terabytes down in Tier 3.
209; ;00:24:37,499 --> 00:24:54,814; ;All right, so given that, this is the kind of the base information we've got, if 146 gig 15,000 RPM drives are selected, right, that ends up being 5.65 terabytes of usable space, again, which is only about half of what we need, right?
210; ;00:24:54,814 --> 00:25:02,448; ;So we end up going with 300 gig 15,000 RPM and this is in the ideal range, okay?
211; ;00:25:02,448 --> 00:25:17,335; ;So just continuing on with this, and this is an example of what we had talked about earlier so, if anything, this is just to sort of reinforce what we talked about before, okay, adding the growth rate along with the replay rate, okay?
212; ;00:25:17,335 --> 00:25:26,740; ;So using that 300 gigabyte 15,000 RPM drive in Tier 1, we're now going to look at Tier 3, okay?
213; ;00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:38,878; ;And so we need 68 terabytes of space in total, right, including growth and replay and we used 11.56 of that in Tier 1, so we need an additional...
214; ;00:25:40,082 --> 00:25:45,217; ;The math ends up being 56.44 terabytes, okay?
215; ;00:25:45,217 --> 00:25:55,600; ;And then by selecting a 1 terabyte drive, then we get close to that, we actually get 68.20 terabytes, okay?
216; ;00:25:55,600 --> 00:26:01,073; ;Which is 68 terabytes, as you recall, was our goal, okay.
217; ;00:26:01,073 --> 00:26:13,831; ;So again, there are different options that you want to use here, but that's just one of the ways of coming up with an answer from the standpoint of sizing for capacity.
218; ;00:26:15,934 --> 00:26:29,503; ;So we want to include this chart because it calls attention to the difference between what drive manufacturers say that the available advertised space is, and the actual space on an individual drive.
219; ;00:26:29,503 --> 00:26:35,394; ;So you can see the advertised space on the left and this is what, for the most part, you and I are familiar with.
220; ;00:26:35,394 --> 00:26:42,521; ;This whole module, we've spoken in these numbers, and what they are, right, is base 10 numbers, okay?
221; ;00:26:42,521 --> 00:26:48,202; ;And that's what drive capacities are measured in and that's what the manufacturers measure them in.
222; ;00:26:48,202 --> 00:26:55,397; ;But most operating systems and file systems represent disk capacity in base 8 numbers, right?
223; ;00:26:55,397 --> 00:27:00,508; ;This is due to the 8-bit byte on which CPUs and software are designed.
224; ;00:27:00,508 --> 00:27:07,908; ;So the difference between base 10 gigabyte and base 8 gigabyte is about 7%.
225; ;00:27:07,908 --> 00:27:17,125; ;So when you're calculating the amount of storage needed for each tier of the solution being designed, you know, this discrepancy needs to be accommodated.
226; ;00:27:17,125 --> 00:27:28,953; ;Okay, so the easiest way to do it is you just take the stated capacity and multiply it by it's actually 0.931, okay?
227; ;00:27:28,953 --> 00:27:35,504; ;To be more specific, it is 0.93132257461548, okay?
228; ;00:27:35,504 --> 00:27:47,594; ;So as an example here then, you see 1000 gigabyte or 1 terabyte of advertised space is going to be 931.57 actual space.
229; ;00:27:47,594 --> 00:27:56,208; ;Now as it says over here on the right, online sizing calculators account for this difference, so you don't have to figure this when you're calculating it.
230; ;00:27:56,208 --> 00:28:07,982; ;Now if you're manually doing a calculation or manually doing sizing, you will want to take this 7% difference into account, okay?
231; ;00:28:07,982 --> 00:28:12,113; ;So that's really the way that you want to look at it.
232; ;00:28:12,113 --> 00:28:26,847; ;So when you're determining how many drives are required to store a certain amount of data, you know, multiply the amount of data, right, whether that's from DPACK or whatever, to be stored by 1.073.
233; ;00:28:27,941 --> 00:28:31,797; ;Right? And that will give you the actual space in binary.
234; ;00:28:33,584 --> 00:28:41,043; ;So now, we've determined the number of drives needed to provide adequate performance and capacity has been determined.
235; ;00:28:41,043 --> 00:28:46,846; ;Let's review the designs in terms of a couple of adjustments you might think about.
236; ;00:28:46,846 --> 00:28:52,598; ;So review this design in terms of how many spares do you need, okay?
237; ;00:28:52,598 --> 00:29:01,373; ;Now, another one that often is overlooked is how feasible is it to get active drive counts to a multiple of the RAID in that particular tier.
238; ;00:29:02,377 --> 00:29:08,455; ;Are we leaving one or two open drive bays, and then what about dual redundancy?
239; ;00:29:08,455 --> 00:29:18,139; ;Okay, so hot spare recommendations, so for most configurations, plan on one hot spare per 25 drives...
240; ;00:29:18,139 --> 00:29:21,218; ;Excuse me, 24 drives of the same drive type.
241; ;00:29:21,218 --> 00:29:32,412; ;Now this could be again depending on, you know, the deal and where you're at, it could be anywhere from 24 to maybe even up as high as 36.
242; ;00:29:32,412 --> 00:29:37,824; ;And again, this will depend on, for example, the quote tool.
243; ;00:29:37,824 --> 00:29:44,899; ;The quoting tool will actually size for one hot spare per enclosure, right?
244; ;00:29:44,899 --> 00:29:48,531; ;So if you have an enclosure with 3.5-inch drives in them, right, guess what?
245; ;00:29:48,531 --> 00:29:52,997; ;You're going to have 12 drives in the enclosure.
246; ;00:29:52,997 --> 00:29:56,812; ;It's not a requirement that you have a hot spare in there, okay?
247; ;00:29:56,812 --> 00:30:04,602; ;So as you're doing sizing, keep in mind this figure of one spare per 24 drives of the same drive type.
248; ;00:30:04,602 --> 00:30:17,509; ;Okay, so In that case, if there was a 3.5-inch drives with the same, you had two different enclosures fully populated with 12 drives in each, all you need is one spare across those two enclosures.
249; ;00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:34,920; ;So certainly depending on the size of the drive, you know, if you're talking about 6 terabyte drives for example, having 1 hot spare per twenty-four is a huge difference than having 1 hot spare for 12 and another hot spare for another 12, right?
250; ;00:30:34,925 --> 00:30:36,661; ;Okay.
251; ;00:30:36,661 --> 00:30:40,739; ;So this can be, you know, that is an example of how cost can come into play.
252; ;00:30:40,739 --> 00:30:46,955; ;Okay, so can the design be improved and still stay within the customer's budget, okay?
253; ;00:30:46,955 --> 00:30:56,407; ;So for example, here, mid to large configurations, it says when possible, try to match the active drive count to the largest RAID type in the tier.
254; ;00:30:56,407 --> 00:31:10,754; ;Okay, so for example, RAID 5-9, if you're going to have RAID 5-9 in a tier, if you can get to an active drives in multiples of 9, that's ideal.
255; ;00:31:10,754 --> 00:31:18,326; ;Not a requirement but it's ideal, okay, because remember we're striping across all the drives on a given tier, right?
256; ;00:31:18,326 --> 00:31:20,942; ;So if we can get to multiples of nine, that's great.
257; ;00:31:24,916 --> 00:31:29,330; ;And then 6-10, another example, active drives in multiples of 10.
258; ;00:31:29,330 --> 00:31:33,565; ;So if you're talking about RAID 10, you're just talking about multiples of 2.
259; ;00:31:33,565 --> 00:31:49,690; ;So if we're talking single redundancy in Tier 1, we're talking about, you know, like 18 drives, you wouldn't want to use necessarily just 9 because again that's going to be an odd number when you're talking about RAID 10.
260; ;00:31:49,690 --> 00:32:03,178; ;Okay, so it may not be feasible in every case, but this is something that can be built into the design that will help down the road as far as saving space, okay?
261; ;00:32:04,655 --> 00:32:15,081; ;Again, if you look at drive quantities, sometimes it would be appropriate to add two additional 15K drives and three 7K drives for hot spares.
262; ;00:32:15,081 --> 00:32:19,626; ;It might also be appropriate to add three additional active 7K drives.
263; ;00:32:19,626 --> 00:32:25,770; ;Again, this is going to give us benefit by filling up those empty drive bays, okay?
264; ;00:32:25,770 --> 00:32:36,575; ;Now It's going to, again, increase the cost of the system so you have to be mindful of that, and that's why we said, it kind of comes down to cost and where the customer's budget is.
265; ;00:32:36,575 --> 00:32:44,104; ;Again, we've talked about dual redundancy a few times considering the implications, but again, keep in mind that dual redundancy...
266; ;00:32:44,104 --> 00:32:54,574; ;Now this is starting with SCOS version 6.7, at least it may go back a little to 6.6 or 6.5 but in 6.7 for sure dual...
267; ;00:32:54,574 --> 00:33:01,122; ;Any drives that are larger than 2 terabytes in a particular tier is going to force dual redundancy.
268; ;00:33:02,224 --> 00:33:11,256; ;So for example, if RAID 10 is being used in Tier 1, RAID 10 will actually be RAID 10 dual mirror.
269; ;00:33:11,256 --> 00:33:17,365; ;Remember, so instead of a two times multiplier that you want to use, it's a three times multiplier, okay?
270; ;00:33:17,365 --> 00:33:34,853; ;And we'll see that as now some new read-intensive drives are coming out with the latest read-intensive drive, the MRIs as it is referred to Mainstream Read-Intensive drives, the most recent one is 3.8 terabytes.
271; ;00:33:34,853 --> 00:33:41,694; ;So if you put that in, even if it was an all-flash array, if that's in 1 tier.
272; ;00:33:41,694 --> 00:33:49,228; ;It's going to be in Tier 1, you have to take that into account as it is going to do dual redundancy because of the size of the drive.
273; ;00:33:51,493 --> 00:33:54,518; ;So that's pretty much going to wrap up our discussion of capacity.
274; ;00:33:54,518 --> 00:34:05,311; ;So let's look at the next step in the SC Series sizing steps and that is determining number and type of front-end connections, okay?
275; ;00:34:05,311 --> 00:34:11,089; ;So before we enter into that information, let's look at a discussion question.
276; ;00:34:11,089 --> 00:34:12,657; ;What size for...
277; ;00:34:12,657 --> 00:34:19,927; ;When sizing for front-end, what throughput percent should be used, 95th, 99th or peak?
278; ;00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:23,657; ;If you remember that discussion from earlier.
279; ;00:34:23,657 --> 00:34:25,582; ;Right. That needs to be peak throughput.
280; ;00:34:25,582 --> 00:34:35,125; ;Remember, it was 95th percentile for IOs, peak throughput number for throughput, okay?
281; ;00:34:35,125 --> 00:34:36,441; ;So keep that in mind.
282; ;00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:40,188; ;Okay, Designing front-end connections.
283; ;00:34:40,188 --> 00:34:49,093; ;So remember, by definition, front-end connections are connections from the storage center SAN out to servers or hosts.
284; ;00:34:50,116 --> 00:34:51,571; ;Okay?
285; ;00:34:51,571 --> 00:34:55,534; ;Storage center maintains separate ports for incoming IO from servers,
286; ;00:34:55,534 --> 00:35:06,409; ;As we said, referred to as the front-end versus connectivity to the disks, which we refer to as the back-end, and that's the next sizing tool, the next sizing discussion we'll have, okay?
287; ;00:35:06,409 --> 00:35:13,765; ;The specific type of front-end connectivity will be frequently driven by what's in the customer environment, right?
288; ;00:35:13,765 --> 00:35:15,935; ;So does the customer have Fibre Channel?
289; ;00:35:17,292 --> 00:35:18,539; ;How about iSCSI?
290; ;00:35:20,863 --> 00:35:24,260; ;In the iSCSI environment, is it a software initiator?
291; ;00:35:24,260 --> 00:35:26,416; ;Is it a hardware?
292; ;00:35:26,416 --> 00:35:32,668; ;iSCSI hardware which basically is going to be a TCP off-load engine, you may have heard, that's a TOE card.
293; ;00:35:33,995 --> 00:35:36,362; ;Do they have FC over Ethernet?
294; ;00:35:36,362 --> 00:35:41,071; ;We don't see a lot of that in our environments, but it's worth a question.
295; ;00:35:41,071 --> 00:35:44,696; ;And what's their current infrastructure? Is it Fibre Channel? Is it iSCSI?
296; ;00:35:44,696 --> 00:35:49,193; ;Are they thinking of moving away from one or the other, okay.
297; ;00:35:49,193 --> 00:35:51,149; ;And that's one thing nice about the storage center, right.
298; ;00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:57,523; ;It can do Fibre Channel, iSCSI or FCoE out to host, okay?
299; ;00:35:57,523 --> 00:36:08,878; ;So what we have to figure out here in designing the front-end connectivity is we have to figure out the appropriate number of ports that must be in design to accommodate the workload, okay?
300; ;00:36:08,878 --> 00:36:22,181; ;So when we look at the data we use here, it should be total aggregated front-end traffic, megabytes, might even be in kilobytes, okay, depending on what, if it's DPACK or some other form of data collection.
301; ;00:36:23,461 --> 00:36:24,483; ;Okay?
302; ;00:36:24,483 --> 00:36:30,966; ;So after you get that collection, you have to determine what the front-end throughput is.
303; ;00:36:30,966 --> 00:36:39,897; ;You know, remember, as we just had on that discussion question, once the maximum throughput value is identified, it's possible to figure out how many front-end connections are required.
304; ;00:36:39,897 --> 00:36:44,132; ;Remember, we're looking at the peak front-end throughput.
305; ;00:36:44,132 --> 00:36:46,319; ;Okay, that's the big thing, okay?
306; ;00:36:48,438 --> 00:36:56,648; ;As we move forward, that's what we want to look at, right, from a DPACK report in particular, it's the peak amount of throughput.
307; ;00:36:58,409 --> 00:37:00,466; ;So let's take a look at the...
308; ;00:37:00,466 --> 00:37:15,125; ;When we're talking about designing front-end connections, this chart gives us kind of a general guidance on what the bandwidth is in theory what the interface is, and what the port bandwidth actually is.
309; ;00:37:15,125 --> 00:37:18,330; ;Okay, you know, again, this is an average...
310; ;00:37:18,330 --> 00:37:21,127; ;Your mileage may vary type of thing.
311; ;00:37:21,127 --> 00:37:25,869; ;But notice the difference, for example, 10 gig iSCSI is 600 megabytes per second.
312; ;00:37:27,182 --> 00:37:35,246; ;Okay, 1 gig iSCSI is 60 megabytes per second, so it's definitely not what the advertised throughput is, okay?
313; ;00:37:35,246 --> 00:37:45,383; ;So you want to use these approximate port bandwidth numbers to determine the number of front-end ports required, okay.
314; ;00:37:45,383 --> 00:37:50,657; ;To accommodate data traffic going in and out of the environment from the host.
315; ;00:37:50,657 --> 00:38:07,165; ;Now one thing to call out here, we don't say it in the chart itself, but all of these connectors here, Fibre Channel, iSCSI, FCoE, they all have to go through a switch of some kind, Fibre Channel, or an iSCSI or an Ethernet switch, right?
316; ;00:38:07,165 --> 00:38:17,950; ;Remember that an SCv2000 does have the option to use direct connect SAS, right, it's 12 gig SAS when it's connecting out to host.
317; ;00:38:19,034 --> 00:38:26,595; ;So in a couple of slides, we're going to talk about connecting to the back-end and from a standpoint of throughput.
318; ;00:38:26,595 --> 00:38:36,097; ;You want to keep those numbers in mind or refer to those if you have an SCv200 and you need to determine if the bandwidth considerations for...
319; ;00:38:36,097 --> 00:38:39,805; ;You know, that particular model because it does have SAS on the front end.
320; ;00:38:39,805 --> 00:38:46,759; ;Today it's the only one of the SC Series models that supports SAS out to servers.
321; ;00:38:48,582 --> 00:38:54,484; ;All right, let's look at some other considerations around designing front-end connections, okay?
322; ;00:38:54,484 --> 00:39:01,777; ;So again, you want to use DPACK or some other tool to analyze the customer's throughput between host and storage.
323; ;00:39:01,777 --> 00:39:09,770; ;Again, remember, keep in mind the network type, whether it's iSCSI, whether it's Fibre Channel, and what are those requirements.
324; ;00:39:09,770 --> 00:39:14,397; ;In other words, what speed of Fibre Channel is it? Is it 8 gig, is it 16 gig?
325; ;00:39:14,397 --> 00:39:21,325; ;Always remember to use the customer's peak throughput from those analysis tools, right?
326; ;00:39:21,325 --> 00:39:30,087; ;Design front-end requirements to have enough active ports to accommodate the customer's doubled bandwidth.
327; ;00:39:30,087 --> 00:39:35,444; ;That's what we say there, doubled is the customer's peak throughput when you're designing front-end ports.
328; ;00:39:35,444 --> 00:39:37,676; ;So why would you do that?
329; ;00:39:37,676 --> 00:39:42,835; ;All right, while you would do it in the scenario of a dual controller environment which again...
330; ;00:39:44,087 --> 00:39:54,604; ;80-85% of our customers have a dual controller environment, in that type of scenario, right, the controllers are active-active, meaning that they share the total front-end throughput.
331; ;00:39:54,604 --> 00:40:06,399; ;So if one of the controllers goes down, either for maintenance or there's some type of failure, the single remaining controller runs but it has to handle all of the front-end traffic.
332; ;00:40:06,399 --> 00:40:13,418; ;If one controller is down, does the customer expect to run smoothly on just the remaining controller?
333; ;00:40:13,418 --> 00:40:17,919; ;Right, if he does, the throughput number should be double.
334; ;00:40:17,919 --> 00:40:20,108; ;It's as simple as that, right?
335; ;00:40:20,108 --> 00:40:35,365; ;So if a customer only has one controller, if you're only sizing for one, maybe it's a DR site, maybe it's a very small implementation, yeah, then you wouldn't have to worry about this doubling of the front-end ports, okay?
336; ;00:40:35,365 --> 00:40:39,171; ;Another thing is determine if the front-end ports are going to be used for replication.
337; ;00:40:39,171 --> 00:40:45,017; ;So if they're doing replication, keep that in mind in terms of bandwidth, okay?
338; ;00:40:45,017 --> 00:40:53,931; ;Consider again the network type, again, most of our customers use iSCSI for replication, so how many ports are you going to have do you have for iSCSI?
339; ;00:40:53,931 --> 00:40:59,046; ;Do you have iSCSI to the host as well as for replication?
340; ;00:40:59,046 --> 00:41:04,673; ;Okay, so that's another thing to consider if you've got replication in the environment.
341; ;00:41:04,673 --> 00:41:17,823; ;One thing to keep in mind, it may be necessary to convert, depending on the tool, it may be necessary to convert kilobytes per second to megabytes per second to really get an accurate analysis if you've got the front-end sized properly.
342; ;00:41:19,512 --> 00:41:29,891; ;So let's look at an example of taking information from a tool and using it in coming up with a sizing consideration for the front-end.
343; ;00:41:29,891 --> 00:41:31,726; ;So here's a DPACK report.
344; ;00:41:31,726 --> 00:41:35,270; ;If you look at the DPACK report, there's a peak there of about...
345; ;00:41:35,270 --> 00:41:40,862; ;It's hard to tell exactly, but let's say about 1, 900 megabytes per second.
346; ;00:41:40,862 --> 00:41:46,697; ;Okay, so that's total, it's showing 1,900 reads, okay?
347; ;00:41:46,697 --> 00:41:52,195; ;So that's what about 2200, right, about 8 o'clock.
348; ;00:41:54,301 --> 00:42:09,926; ;Now that 1,900 megabytes per second, remember we're sizing to the peak for the front-end, so that 1,900 is sustainable by three 8 gig Fibre Channel FC ports or two 16 gig Fibre Channel FC ports, right?
349; ;00:42:09,926 --> 00:42:14,187; ;That means recommending a four port Fiber Channel card.
350; ;00:42:15,411 --> 00:42:17,153; ;Right? In the case of an 8 gig.
351; ;00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:24,236; ;Because the 16 gig Fiber Channel port cards are only dual port anyway, okay?
352; ;00:42:24,236 --> 00:42:36,682; ;So in either case, whether the customer has 8 gig Fibre Channel in their environment or if they've got 16 gig Fibre Channel I would recommend having a second card in the controller, right?
353; ;00:42:36,682 --> 00:42:49,981; ;Just for future expansion if nothing else, so that would mean you'd have two Fibre Channel cards Fibre Channel HBAs in both controllers, okay?
354; ;00:42:49,981 --> 00:42:56,176; ;Now another thing to keep in mind is the average IO size, you want to make sure that isn't getting abnormally large.
355; ;00:42:56,176 --> 00:42:57,998; ;So how do we figure that out?
356; ;00:42:57,998 --> 00:43:05,993; ;So average IO size can be determined by dividing the total IOPS into the megabytes per second, right?
357; ;00:43:05,993 --> 00:43:13,252; ;So if we look at, for example, the 6 o'clock timeframe which is a little more of an average time, we see about...
358; ;00:43:17,122 --> 00:43:21,479; ;The throughput is about 1,100 megabytes per second, okay?
359; ;00:43:21,479 --> 00:43:33,671; ;And this is going back to our example of 10,000 front-end IOPS, we don't see that on this chart, but 10,000 front-end IOPS throughput is about 1,100 megabytes.
360; ;00:43:33,671 --> 00:43:36,105; ;That's where the 1100 is coming from.
361; ;00:43:36,105 --> 00:43:37,935; ;Therefore... Oops.
362; ;00:43:39,806 --> 00:43:40,825; ;Sorry.
363; ;00:43:40,825 --> 00:43:53,627; ;Therefore, 1100 divided by 10,000 is 0.11 which is 11 kilobyte average block size that would be considered in the normal range.
364; ;00:43:53,627 --> 00:44:02,920; ;So what we're looking for there is if you're going well beyond that average block size, that could have a definite impact on front-end throughput.
365; ;00:44:05,184 --> 00:44:07,869; ;Let's take a look at a couple of review questions again.
366; ;00:44:08,882 --> 00:44:11,336; ;And we're going to go ahead and start with...
367; ;00:44:12,546 --> 00:44:17,528; ;A 10 gig iSCSI interface has about how much port bandwidth?
368; ;00:44:19,233 --> 00:44:21,512; ;We had that chart earlier. Yep.
369; ;00:44:21,512 --> 00:44:25,760; ;About 600 megabytes in a 10 gig interface.
370; ;00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:30,849; ;What is the recommended number of spares in an SC Series?
371; ;00:44:30,849 --> 00:44:31,968; ;And we talked about that.
372; ;00:44:33,668 --> 00:44:38,019; ;One spare per twenty-four drives of the same drive type.
373; ;00:44:39,538 --> 00:44:40,819; ;Okay, good.
374; ;00:44:40,819 --> 00:44:46,161; ;And then finally, what RAID types indicate dual redundancy is applied in a tier?
375; ;00:44:48,161 --> 00:44:49,957; ;A couple different ones, right?
376; ;00:44:49,957 --> 00:44:50,958; ;Yep.
377; ;00:44:50,958 --> 00:44:55,353; ;RAID 10 dual mirror and RAID 6.
378; ;00:44:55,353 --> 00:45:01,723; ;Remember that RAID 10 and RAID 5 are single redundancy.
379; ;00:45:01,723 --> 00:45:05,293; ;RAID 10 dual mirror, RAID 6 are dual redundancy.
380; ;00:45:07,168 --> 00:45:15,509; ;So the final sizing step in an SC Series is to determine the number of back-end connections.
381; ;00:45:17,626 --> 00:45:24,590; ;So we determined the number and type of the front-end, now it's time to determine the number of back-end connections.
382; ;00:45:24,590 --> 00:45:28,442; ;So when we talk about determining the number of back-end connections.
383; ;00:45:28,442 --> 00:45:43,213; ;One thing that makes it a little bit easier is the fact that when we're connecting to the back-end, and remember the back-end connectivity refers to the link between the storage center controllers and the disk enclosures, so that's a direct connection.
384; ;00:45:43,213 --> 00:45:50,957; ;It's just SAS connectivity, so there's no Fibre Channel, there's no iSCSI determining which is which.
385; ;00:45:50,957 --> 00:45:58,516; ;It's direct connect, so we're not going through a switch, it's direct connect on an SC9000 and an SC8000.
386; ;00:45:58,516 --> 00:46:03,632; ;We're directly connecting between the controllers and the enclosures.
387; ;00:46:03,632 --> 00:46:15,802; ;So our example here is this is two SC9000 controllers and we're directly connected to one, two, three, four enclosures, okay?
388; ;00:46:15,802 --> 00:46:24,858; ;And we've got two half-height SAS cards in each, those are the two SAS cards, one on the top, second one on the bottom.
389; ;00:46:24,858 --> 00:46:28,381; ;And then we're coming up with two chains based on how we're connecting them.
390; ;00:46:28,381 --> 00:46:34,231; ;So let's talk a little bit more about this SAS port technology that we're seeing here.
391; ;00:46:34,231 --> 00:46:41,022; ;One thing to be aware of, the one physical port actually contains four virtual ports.
392; ;00:46:41,022 --> 00:46:48,675; ;They're often referred to as lanes, but they are physically there and there are 12 gigs per lane.
393; ;00:46:48,675 --> 00:47:01,272; ;So you'll hear this term 12 gig SAS, but realistically, it's 48 gigs of available bandwidth if we're talking about the physical SAS port, okay?
395; ;00:47:09,394 --> 00:47:19,319; ;One 2-port SAS card provides two SAS chains, you can have one chain on each port, 96 gigs of bandwidth, right.
394; ;00:47:04,207 --> 00:47:09,394; ;Now if you've got, as we know, there's a 2-port SAS card that we're seeing over here, right?
396; ;00:47:19,319 --> 00:47:33,241; ;384 drives as of this release, SCOS 7.0, when we developed this material, 192 drives per SAS chain was the max, okay?
397; ;00:47:33,241 --> 00:47:39,270; ;So again, that limit could certainly increase as future releases of SCOS come out.
398; ;00:47:39,270 --> 00:47:40,804; ;So keep that in mind.
399; ;00:47:41,954 --> 00:47:47,483; ;Future growth is definitely possible as different releases of SCOS come out.
400; ;00:47:47,483 --> 00:47:54,707; ;Now when you're sizing the back-end on an SC9000, here are a couple of things to kind of consider.
401; ;00:47:54,707 --> 00:48:02,229; ;You want to double the front-end bandwidth and we'll give you a little example here of what that means, but you want to double what the front-end bandwidth is.
402; ;00:48:02,229 --> 00:48:09,806; ;When you do that doubling, you want to convert from megabytes per second to gigabits per second on the back-end.
403; ;00:48:09,806 --> 00:48:17,669; ;I'll kind of explain what that means, and then we'll kind of estimate the number of SAS chains needed based on that.
404; ;00:48:17,669 --> 00:48:30,441; ;So as an example here, if I've got 312 drives, so we did an analysis, we found 312 drives is what the customer needs.
405; ;00:48:30,441 --> 00:48:38,244; ;If we divide that by the maximum number of drives per chain, that's going to give us 1.6 chains.
406; ;00:48:38,244 --> 00:48:43,204; ;And of course, again, you can't 1.6 chains, so you round that up to two chains.
407; ;00:48:43,204 --> 00:48:52,161; ;So first of all, if you have a system with 312 drives, you would need 2 SAS chains at a minimum just to get all those drives on there.
408; ;00:48:52,161 --> 00:49:00,990; ;And certainly, it's a good idea to leave some room on the SAS chains, especially on a new installation, so you don't want to fill up all the drives anyway.
409; ;00:49:00,990 --> 00:49:09,333; ;You know, in our case here, so if we had 192 drives, even that you'd want to make it on 2 chains, okay?
410; ;00:49:09,333 --> 00:49:19,367; ;Now one thing to keep in mind as you're figuring out the number of chains, if you're familiar with the SC8000, we'll talk more specifically about the SC8000 next.
411; ;00:49:19,367 --> 00:49:31,146; ;But on the SC8000, you had a back-end interconnect, some of you may be familiar with, that back-end interconnect is no longer needed on the SC9000.
412; ;00:49:31,146 --> 00:49:43,763; ;And when we talk about the SC8000, we'll explain the purpose of that back-end interconnect when we get there, but that's something you don't need on the SC9000, okay?
413; ;00:49:43,763 --> 00:49:52,525; ;Now as we mentioned a moment ago, it's important to ensure that back-end bandwidth is double that amount of front-end bandwidth, okay?
414; ;00:49:52,525 --> 00:49:59,698; ;The reason for that is to allow for additional overhead incurred by RAID, right, when you're writing to the disk.
415; ;00:49:59,698 --> 00:50:05,510; ;Your performance needs would generally be met by a single SAS card in each controller, okay.
416; ;00:50:05,510 --> 00:50:10,777; ;But be certain that you meet this 2x bandwidth requirement that we're talking about, okay.
417; ;00:50:10,777 --> 00:50:22,908; ;So in our example of 312 drives, we said we needed to chains, but now it doesn't take into consideration IO traffic from the front-end ports, okay?
418; ;00:50:22,908 --> 00:50:28,256; ;Remember though, that traffic is flowing through the controllers and down to the drives.
419; ;00:50:28,256 --> 00:50:37,110; ;Okay, so to address that traffic from the front-end, we go back to the front-end throughput numbers that we've talked about a little earlier.
420; ;00:50:38,285 --> 00:50:47,072; ;So look at this example, assume our data gathering analysis showed 700 megabytes of front-end traffic, okay?
421; ;00:50:47,072 --> 00:50:52,919; ;So when sizing the front-end, remember that it should accommodate a minimum of 1400 megabytes, right?
422; ;00:50:52,919 --> 00:50:59,364; ;So then if a controller fails, it can fail to that second controller and everything will keep running fine.
423; ;00:50:59,364 --> 00:51:13,440; ;So in our example of 312 drives, remember we want double the throughput of 1,400 megabytes per second, so best practices would dictate a back-end configuration that looks like this.
424; ;00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:23,510; ;If the front-end bandwidth is 400 megabytes per second, right, then back-end bandwidth should be twice that or 2, 800 megabytes per second.
425; ;00:51:23,510 --> 00:51:36,201; ;And if you recall, we said we want to convert that to gigabits so that's going to be 22.4 gigabits per second that we're going to need keeping that front-end throughput in mind.
426; ;00:51:38,344 --> 00:51:39,734; ;Okay?
427; ;00:51:39,734 --> 00:51:46,832; ;So keep that in mind when you're designing your SAS back-end on an SC9000.
428; ;00:51:46,832 --> 00:51:51,082; ;So that's back-end connectivity for an SC9000.
429; ;00:51:51,082 --> 00:51:56,485; ;Let's look at back-end connectivity for the SC8000, okay?
430; ;00:51:56,485 --> 00:52:06,385; ;This is a picture here of an SC8000 and we're going to do very similar to what we did with the SC9000 and then we've got dual controller SC8000s and we've got four enclosures.
431; ;00:52:06,385 --> 00:52:10,913; ;We've got full height SAS cards here as opposed to the half-height we have on the SC9000.
432; ;00:52:10,913 --> 00:52:24,922; ;Notice, it might be little bit hard to tell, but there are actually four ports up here as opposed to two on the SC9000 and of course, the reason for that is SC8000 has 6 gig SAS.
433; ;00:52:24,922 --> 00:52:34,495; ;And just as we discussed a moment ago with the SC9000, there are four lanes and each lane is 6 gig per second, okay?
434; ;00:52:34,495 --> 00:52:43,559; ;So then we end up with the 24 gig throughput here, okay, because we've got 6 gig of SAS, right?
435; ;00:52:43,559 --> 00:52:53,455; ;Now, one 4-port SAS card provides two SAS chains, 96 gig of bandwidth, and again up to 384 drives.
436; ;00:52:53,455 --> 00:53:08,041; ;So just like we saw on the SC9000, potentially, we could go over that 192 max per chain down the line, but as of right now, as of version 7.0, that's the max that we're at.
437; ;00:53:08,041 --> 00:53:16,901; ;And as we talked about with the SC9000, same kind of rules apply in terms of making sure we don't saturate a chain adding another card to a second...
438; ;00:53:18,491 --> 00:53:23,693; ;To a second controller if you want to go that route, it'd be highly recommend it.
439; ;00:53:23,693 --> 00:53:35,803; ;Now one thing to keep in mind, we touched on this briefly on the SC9000, but plan on using one SAS chain on an SC8000 as an interconnect between the two controllers.
440; ;00:53:37,134 --> 00:53:42,063; ;Okay? There's only one back-end SAS chain being used for this, okay.
441; ;00:53:42,063 --> 00:53:47,476; ;So if there's only one, you have to make sure that you've got an interconnect set up.
442; ;00:53:47,476 --> 00:53:53,552; ;Okay, so what that does, it provides a high-speed link within the system for back-end functions.
443; ;00:53:53,552 --> 00:53:58,649; ;And as much as anything, it's for write-cache mirroring, okay?
444; ;00:53:58,649 --> 00:54:08,509; ;So if the system requires two or more back-end SAS chains for disk enclosures, you don't necessarily have to have that cross-connect SAS cable, okay?
445; ;00:54:08,509 --> 00:54:14,453; ;But it is something to kind of keep in mind especially if you have smaller systems, okay?
446; ;00:54:14,453 --> 00:54:28,523; ;And the same kind of considerations are here in terms of making sure that you have plenty of bandwidth, so you want to size that SAS back in, again, double the front-end bandwidth.
447; ;00:54:28,523 --> 00:54:34,119; ;When you're doing the calculation, remember you want to convert megabytes per second on the front-end and gigabits per second.
448; ;00:54:34,119 --> 00:54:42,096; ;Which is what it would be on the back-end and then give yourself an estimate of the number of SAS chains needed.
1; ;00:00:01,556 --> 00:00:07,057; ;What do you think is step one in the process of sizing an SC Series solution?
2; ;00:00:07,057 --> 00:00:15,775; ;As you might guess, this next section coming up here is going to look at some of the steps involved in determining the sizing.
3; ;00:00:15,775 --> 00:00:21,133; ;So our answer here is, gather and interpret customer performance requirements.
4; ;00:00:21,133 --> 00:00:25,042; ;If you step back and think about it, you go, "Yeah, that kind of makes sense." Right?
5; ;00:00:25,042 --> 00:00:28,963; ;You have to get the requirements first before you can go forward.
6; ;00:00:28,963 --> 00:00:35,559; ;So let's look at process step by step and what's involved in sizing.
7; ;00:00:35,559 --> 00:00:47,014; ;So, there are really five different sizing steps that we're going to take a look at, so the first one is gather and interpret customer performance requirements.
8; ;00:00:48,471 --> 00:01:05,497; ;We're going to design first to meet the IOPS needed, fill in Tier 3 to meet the capacity needs, determine the number and type of front-end connections required, and determine the number of back-end connections required.
9; ;00:01:07,727 --> 00:01:12,934; ;So we're going to start by gather and interpret customer performance requirements.
10; ;00:01:15,016 --> 00:01:17,172; ;So data gathering.
11; ;00:01:17,172 --> 00:01:21,756; ;Now, as we've said, there are many methods of data gathering, okay?
12; ;00:01:21,756 --> 00:01:28,234; ;Really the choice of how you get this information is really on a personal preference, okay?
13; ;00:01:28,234 --> 00:01:35,474; ;Here are some of the things that you're going to need to make sure to keep an eye on, and that is determine the acceptable latency.
14; ;00:01:35,474 --> 00:01:40,697; ;As much as anything, this might be something that comes from the customer, okay?
15; ;00:01:43,804 --> 00:01:48,720; ;Load is measured in terms of IOPS, right?
16; ;00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:53,415; ;Throughput is measured in terms of megabytes per second.
17; ;00:01:53,415 --> 00:01:56,600; ;Okay, those are a couple of terms that you want to keep in mind.
18; ;00:01:56,600 --> 00:02:01,349; ;Load equates to IOPS and throughput equates to...
19; ;00:02:01,349 --> 00:02:02,853; ;Okay, let me bring up this here.
20; ;00:02:02,853 --> 00:02:04,372; ;So, this is what we're talking about.
21; ;00:02:04,372 --> 00:02:11,325; ;Load is measured in terms of IOPS, throughput is measured in terms of megabytes, okay?
22; ;00:02:11,325 --> 00:02:18,250; ;So performance expectation, very often, is based on latency, okay?
23; ;00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:22,386; ;Front-end IOPS can help gauge the maximum back-end load.
24; ;00:02:24,732 --> 00:02:29,004; ;Okay, and then couple of defaults in the SC Series.
25; ;00:02:29,004 --> 00:02:36,601; ;Writes go to Tier 1 at RAID 10 or RAID 10 dual mirror depending if you have single or dual redundancy.
26; ;00:02:36,601 --> 00:02:43,933; ;And you'll always use 2x factor for write IOs, right, because we are dualing data and then mirror, right?
27; ;00:02:43,933 --> 00:02:49,428; ;So that's like two writes there when we're writing into Tier 1, okay?
28; ;00:02:50,967 --> 00:02:56,643; ;So it's real critical that you're looking, here's a good point here.
29; ;00:02:56,643 --> 00:03:02,013; ;When you're sizing, if you're sizing below peak when the sample time is done in seconds.
30; ;00:03:02,013 --> 00:03:08,608; ;Now, again, very often, when we're sizing for an SC Series, we're going to be using Dell's DPACK tool.
31; ;00:03:08,608 --> 00:03:13,599; ;And we're going to talk, we've got some slides coming up to talk a little more about DPACK.
32; ;00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:26,102; ;But that isn't the only tool you can use, but if you're using DPACK, you want to size below peak when the sample time is in seconds, size to peak when the sample time is in minutes.
33; ;00:03:27,123 --> 00:03:29,209; ;And so these are some of the things to keep in mind.
34; ;00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:37,100; ;Always investigate sustained IO spikes, are they caused by backups, is it caused by, you know, highly sequential IO.
35; ;00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:43,804; ;Remember, when we're sizing with an SC Series, we're looking at random IO, okay?
36; ;00:03:45,069 --> 00:03:50,182; ;And certainly different applications will have different performance expectations, right?
37; ;00:03:50,182 --> 00:04:00,506; ;There's an example, if I'm doing Microsoft Exchange, it requires less than 20 milliseconds of latency on database volumes.
38; ;00:04:00,506 --> 00:04:07,247; ;And write latency on transaction log volumes has to be less than 10 milliseconds, okay?
39; ;00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:15,355; ;So, whichever method you use, whether it's DPACK or something else, you really want to look for the same type of information, okay?
40; ;00:04:18,853 --> 00:04:23,688; ;So let's run through a couple of review questions here covering the last few slides that we talked about.
41; ;00:04:23,688 --> 00:04:33,248; ;If capacity needs to be added, let's say, six months after we've already done an installation of a multi-tier SC system, what tier are those drives added to?
42; ;00:04:34,935 --> 00:04:36,355; ;Yep, you probably know that one.
43; ;00:04:36,355 --> 00:04:38,089; ;Tier 3. Good.
44; ;00:04:39,406 --> 00:04:46,141; ;How about six months after initial installation, I want more performance, what tier are those drives added to?
45; ;00:04:47,343 --> 00:04:48,722; ;Yep.
46; ;00:04:48,722 --> 00:04:50,544; ;Tier 1. Good.
47; ;00:04:52,223 --> 00:04:57,316; ;So why is it not a good idea to size an SC Series to the bare minimums?
48; ;00:04:57,316 --> 00:04:59,395; ;Well, we talked about this earlier.
49; ;00:04:59,395 --> 00:05:07,214; ;The customer is not going to be happy if their system grows and this will generate multiple support calls because of poor performance.
50; ;00:05:07,214 --> 00:05:12,699; ;And as we said, it's going to be difficult for the support folks to troubleshoot these issues.
51; ;00:05:12,699 --> 00:05:17,216; ;And certainly, the customer is probably not going to want to hear what the support people have to say.
52; ;00:05:17,216 --> 00:05:19,553; ;So, good.
53; ;00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:22,766; ;All right, discussion question here.
54; ;00:05:22,766 --> 00:05:28,212; ;What Dell tool is an important part of sizing an SC Series solution properly?
55; ;00:05:28,212 --> 00:05:31,551; ;All right, so we talked about this already. DPACK.
56; ;00:05:31,551 --> 00:05:34,894; ;We're going to talk a little bit more about DPACK here in the next few slides.
57; ;00:05:34,894 --> 00:05:40,126; ;But let's define what it is, right?
58; ;00:05:40,126 --> 00:05:44,892; ;So DPACK stands for Dell Performance Analysis Kit.
59; ;00:05:44,892 --> 00:05:53,140; ;Okay, it is a no cost workload performance analysis tool from Dell using open standards.
60; ;00:05:53,868 --> 00:06:03,320; ;Well, the significance of the open standards is that this is actually can be used in any environment.
61; ;00:06:03,323 --> 00:06:15,175; ;So we often see even systems that might have some other type of storage vendor in it, we use DPACK to try to analyze the sizing of their performance tool, okay?
62; ;00:06:15,175 --> 00:06:25,032; ;It's a highly interactive web interface takes advantage of HTML 5, so you can look at the tool from any device.
63; ;00:06:25,032 --> 00:06:28,459; ;Data is transmitted in near real-time, okay?
64; ;00:06:28,459 --> 00:06:36,555; ;So it's a lightweight, remote, agent-less tool, okay?
65; ;00:06:36,555 --> 00:06:44,465; ;The current revision of DPACK, and DPACK is constantly going through updates, right, so DPACK 2 is the current version.
66; ;00:06:44,465 --> 00:06:52,206; ;There is training available for DPACK 2, online-based training if you need to learn a little bit more about it.
67; ;00:06:52,206 --> 00:07:04,329; ;But it's very critical, really a critical piece in determining what size a customer's SC Series array at.
68; ;00:07:06,746 --> 00:07:22,526; ;So as we look at DPACK analysis, it's really a good idea to have DPACK record a system, a customer's environment for multiple days, right, rather than just a consistent period of time.
69; ;00:07:22,526 --> 00:07:27,330; ;Very often we hear, "We want to wait until the end of the month to capture a process."
70; ;00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:38,286; ;The problem is this process very likely is just a subset or likely overshadowed by different maintenance activities, backup, and other maintenance things that occur throughout the month.
71; ;00:07:38,286 --> 00:07:57,670; ;So instead of waiting for that end-of-month period, run a 24-hour collection, you know, and just continue on from a salesperson point of view, from a Dell salesperson slant, just keep working the sales processes you normally would.
72; ;00:07:57,670 --> 00:08:10,730; ;But again, try to run and try to get another DPACK for another 24, you know, you might do it three or four times, three or four different days in a month, perhaps, even longer periods of time if you need to.
73; ;00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:14,890; ;But I wouldn't put it on a particular set period of time.
74; ;00:08:14,890 --> 00:08:20,637; ;It's not going to give you an accurate reflection of what's happening in the environment on a continual basis.
75; ;00:08:23,526 --> 00:08:26,795; ;Okay, so we've gathered up the information with DPACK.
76; ;00:08:26,795 --> 00:08:30,569; ;Our next step of the process is the actual design.
77; ;00:08:30,569 --> 00:08:34,943; ;So remember, we want to design first to meet the IOPS needed.
78; ;00:08:34,943 --> 00:08:37,653; ;So this is almost by way of review.
79; ;00:08:37,653 --> 00:08:43,153; ;When designing Tier 1 for the IOPS load, what are some things to kind of keep in mind?
80; ;00:08:44,969 --> 00:08:47,256; ;You will hit these coming up here, but...
81; ;00:08:48,500 --> 00:09:01,063; ;Yep, couple of things, total IOPS needed, average IO size, it's the block size, read versus write ratio, and expected growth, right?
82; ;00:09:01,063 --> 00:09:09,136; ;These are all things that you want to keep in mind when you're sizing for the load in Tier 1.
83; ;00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:23,070; ;Okay, so adjust the IOPS for RAID and read-write ratio, then size Tier 1 for the IOPS and the remaining capacity goes into Tier 3.
84; ;00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:24,588; ;We've talked a lot about that.
85; ;00:09:24,588 --> 00:09:29,739; ;Again, this whole idea of making sure that you're sizing for a Tier 1 first.
86; ;00:09:29,739 --> 00:09:33,602; ;Apply the read-write ratio to the IOPS requirements, okay?
87; ;00:09:33,602 --> 00:09:38,770; ;That's going to come typically from DPACK or some other tool used for gathering.
88; ;00:09:39,842 --> 00:09:47,808; ;Okay, remember, you want to multiply the write IOPS by two to take into account that RAID overhead, okay?
89; ;00:09:47,808 --> 00:09:51,493; ;Now this is, remember, single redundancy.
90; ;00:09:51,493 --> 00:10:00,082; ;If it's dual redundancy, you need to multiply the write IOPS by 3 for RAID 10 DM.
91; ;00:10:00,082 --> 00:10:04,736; ;Okay, so we're just looking at single redundancy in this case, so it would be multiply the write IOPS by 2.
92; ;00:10:07,204 --> 00:10:12,391; ;Okay? Then add read IOPS for total adjusted back-end IOPS.
93; ;00:10:12,391 --> 00:10:21,304; ;Again, you're getting all of this from that ratio that came from DPACK, again, showing the value, the critical nature of DPACK.
94; ;00:10:22,748 --> 00:10:34,218; ;Okay, as we said, you want to make sure in size Tier 1 for 100% of the adjusted IOPS, again, by adjusted, we're talking about the RAID 10, okay?
95; ;00:10:36,708 --> 00:10:40,379; ;Determine the capacity of Tier 1 after sizing for IOPS.
96; ;00:10:40,379 --> 00:10:45,398; ;So you've already sized for IOPS, now let's figure out the capacity that we need.
97; ;00:10:48,141 --> 00:10:50,909; ;Size Tier 3 for whatever's left over.
98; ;00:10:53,782 --> 00:11:03,109; ;Okay, so, kind of, as a rule of thumb, the capacity split between Tier 1 and Tier 3 should be approximately match the read-write ratio.
99; ;00:11:03,109 --> 00:11:15,734; ;Okay, so as an example here, if that read-write ratio coming from DPACK is 80:20, otherwise, 80% read, 20% write, that's typical environment.
100; ;00:11:15,734 --> 00:11:25,692; ;So how we'd want to size for capacity, then is 20% of the capacity should be in Tier 1 and the 80% should be in Tier 3.
101; ;00:11:27,133 --> 00:11:36,857; ;Okay, so using that read-write ratio in reverse to come up with the capacity necessary if I've got a two tier solution.
102; ;00:11:38,804 --> 00:11:43,400; ;Okay, so let's take a look at an example then of gathering IOPS.
103; ;00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:51,443; ;So this is a graph that we would have obtained from a sizing tool as we were gathering our information, right?
104; ;00:11:51,443 --> 00:11:56,037; ;So what this is telling us, let's just kind of take a look at... We've highlighted a few data points on here.
105; ;00:11:56,037 --> 00:12:00,720; ;So let's say at 9 pm, obviously you can tell this is a 24-hour graph, okay?
106; ;00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,933; ;Total IOPS are in blue, the yellow line is reads, and the red is writes.
So let's say at 9 pm, obviously you can tell this is a 24-hour graph, okay?
107; ;00:12:01,933 --> 00:12:11,190; ;Total IOPS are in blue, the yellow line is reads, and the red is writes.
108; ;00:12:11,197 --> 00:12:17,651; ;Okay, so at 9 o'clock, our front-end IOPS is 6,200, right about that.
109; ;00:12:17,651 --> 00:12:25,290; ;And that's comprised of 2,600 writes which we're seeing here, and 3,600 reads, okay?
111; ;00:12:40,201 --> 00:12:44,240; ;Okay, so huge spike in writes and 1,900 reads.
110; ;00:12:26,669 --> 00:12:40,201; ;Now then at about 4 am, there is a front-end peak, right just shy of 6,000 IOPS, about 5,900 IOPS, with 4, 000 writes.
112; ;00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:50,455; ;Okay, so if I'm factoring in the write penalty for these times, remember the write penalty is times 2.
113; ;00:12:50,455 --> 00:12:59,873; ;So I've got 2,600 here, times 2, plus 3,600 equals 8,800, right?
114; ;00:12:59,873 --> 00:13:02,633; ;So there is where the write penalty comes in.
115; ;00:13:03,864 --> 00:13:11,449; ;And then I've got the 4 am time, 4,000 times 2, okay?
116; ;00:13:11,449 --> 00:13:19,591; ;Plus the 1,900, right here, just shy of 2,000, you get 9,900 IOPS.
117; ;00:13:21,506 --> 00:13:24,943; ;Sorry. You get 9,900 IOPS, okay?
118; ;00:13:24,943 --> 00:13:27,927; ;These are points in time on which to focus.
119; ;00:13:29,234 --> 00:13:40,631; ;Okay, so this is where, again, one of the keys here is this is a good time to have a discussion with the customer about what's going on at 9 pm and 4 am.
120; ;00:13:40,631 --> 00:13:42,403; ;Are there mission critical apps going on?
121; ;00:13:42,403 --> 00:13:45,461; ;Are there backups going on, is there something else?
122; ;00:13:45,461 --> 00:13:56,563; ;And so, again, it's critical to understand the customer's environment and how important performance is and the critical nature of performance, that's imperative.
123; ;00:13:56,563 --> 00:14:02,922; ;So in this example, the target design is for approximately 10,000 IOPS on the back-end.
124; ;00:14:04,183 --> 00:14:15,793; ;So in this example, this is customer performance data that came from just a generic graph resulting from a third party data gathering tool, wasn't necessarily DPACK, right?
125; ;00:14:15,793 --> 00:14:24,459; ;Now one of the nice things about DPACK is it simplifies the analysis by providing a summary report, okay?
126; ;00:14:24,459 --> 00:14:34,921; ;So here you'll notice the summary report includes IOPS at peak as well as the IOPS at 95 percentile, also gives you the read-write ratio.
127; ;00:14:36,304 --> 00:14:45,823; ;Okay, so the same conversation needs to happen with the customer regarding the business drivers behind the delta between 95% and peak.
128; ;00:14:45,823 --> 00:14:53,027; ;So that's quite a significant difference there between 95% and peak, so you just want to have a discussion as to why that is.
129; ;00:14:53,027 --> 00:14:55,385; ;So this is the summary.
130; ;00:14:55,385 --> 00:15:00,426; ;Then from here, you can also break down individual servers, right?
131; ;00:15:00,426 --> 00:15:13,031; ;So this is another way of using this tool to try to analyze and figure out where the peaks are and what is the difference, okay?
132; ;00:15:14,814 --> 00:15:18,672; ;All right, this chart should look familiar to you.
133; ;00:15:18,672 --> 00:15:20,313; ;It's got the drive IOPS chart.
134; ;00:15:20,313 --> 00:15:28,951; ;The one difference here is we look at 50/50 read-write ratio and these are more actual numbers than we had seen before.
135; ;00:15:28,951 --> 00:15:41,267; ;But we want to just show this here because we want to look at the calculation that's involved with figuring out how many drives we need based on our IOPS that we need, okay?
136; ;00:15:41,267 --> 00:15:52,271; ;So what you want to do is, you divide the customer's adjusted IOPS, and remember adjusted IOPS would be the case of RAID 10 writes, that's two IOPS,
137; ;00:15:52,271 --> 00:15:59,265; ;But divide the customer's adjusted IOPS by the drive IOPS that you see on this chart here, okay?
138; ;00:15:59,265 --> 00:16:03,433; ;To determine how many drives are required to provide the needed performance.
139; ;00:16:04,825 --> 00:16:14,568; ;Okay, then you multiply the number of drives that we needed, that we came up with on the previous step, by the drive capacity listed,
140; ;00:16:14,568 --> 00:16:20,438; ;You know, to determine the overall, to determine the raw capacity that is necessary.
141; ;00:16:20,438 --> 00:16:30,605; ;Then you would adjust the drive type, drive count, and drive capacity until you meet the required IOPS and as well as the capacity.
142; ;00:16:30,605 --> 00:16:43,382; ;Okay, so this chart can be a great resource, but again, it's based on, you know, 50/50 read-write percent that may not be what DPACK tells us that the customer's environment is.
143; ;00:16:43,382 --> 00:16:50,468; ;So I'm going to give you a calculation here, that's actually a little bit more exact.
144; ;00:16:51,479 --> 00:16:55,633; ;To get a more defined result, let's use this calculation here.
145; ;00:16:55,633 --> 00:17:07,609; ;So you take the write seek time times the write percent, you add the read seek time times the read percent, plus the rotational latency.
146; ;00:17:09,322 --> 00:17:15,509; ;Okay, so whatever that result is you take 1 divided by that result, okay.
147; ;00:17:15,509 --> 00:17:28,316; ;And that will actually provide an IOPS number, that's more accurate, you know, for an individual customer's solution because it's going to take their environment into the calculation.
148; ;00:17:28,316 --> 00:17:42,681; ;Okay, so some of those numbers that I mentioned in that calculation, write seek, and read seek, rotational latency, all those things can be found on the drive manufacturer's website, okay?
149; ;00:17:42,681 --> 00:17:57,778; ;So, again, some of these calculations certainly they can be done manually, some people will use a spreadsheet, there's also online disk calculators, and we'll show you where you can get the online disk calculators later on in this module.
150; ;00:18:01,544 --> 00:18:04,763; ;So let's finish up our discussion about designing for IOPS.
151; ;00:18:04,763 --> 00:18:13,981; ;We're going to go back to this example, if you remember this example had ended up targeting 10,000 back-end IOPS.
152; ;00:18:13,981 --> 00:18:18,691; ;Okay, so to meet those 10,000 back-end IOPS.
153; ;00:18:18,691 --> 00:18:31,525; ;What we need is to look at our chart here and kind of determine how we can best deliver those IOPS in Tier 1, and, again, of course, later on, we'll have capacity growing to Tier 3.
154; ;00:18:31,525 --> 00:18:37,833; ;So if you were to start, for example, by taking the 2.5-inch 15,000 RPM drives.
155; ;00:18:37,833 --> 00:18:51,997; ;As we see they deliver approximately 206 IOPS, 206, 210 right in there, that would mean about 48 active spindles to get 10,000 IOPS.
156; ;00:18:51,997 --> 00:19:02,562; ;So to determine the size of the drives, consider how many Tier 3 drives will be used and how close the system is to the target capacity, okay?
157; ;00:19:02,562 --> 00:19:15,503; ;So to allow for another 2,000 IOPS in Tier 3, back to our original example, the system will need to have approximately 25, 7,200 RPM drives.
158; ;00:19:17,610 --> 00:19:19,142; ;Okay?
159; ;00:19:19,142 --> 00:19:35,425; ;So again, when you're to kind of sum up our design Tier 1 for IOPS load, you want to consider the total IOPS needed, the average size of the IOPS, the number of reads versus writes, and the expected growth rate.
160; ;00:19:35,425 --> 00:19:40,467; ;So taking all of those together will help get you an...
161; ;00:19:41,588 --> 00:19:50,706; ;It gets as close as possible, let's put it that way, to a proper number of IOPS to get the proper amount of performance from Tier 1.
162; ;00:19:53,372 --> 00:19:55,900; ;All right, let's take a look at a couple review questions here.
163; ;00:19:58,841 --> 00:20:04,998; ;Designing Tier 1 for an SC Series for the proper load means designing for what?
164; ;00:20:04,998 --> 00:20:07,407; ;All right, so what does load refer to?
165; ;00:20:07,407 --> 00:20:08,738; ;IOPS, right?
166; ;00:20:08,738 --> 00:20:10,575; ;Yep. Good.
167; ;00:20:10,575 --> 00:20:15,088; ;What data collection tool is lightweight, remote, and agent-less?
168; ;00:20:16,395 --> 00:20:18,737; ;And this should be an easy one. DPACK.
169; ;00:20:20,279 --> 00:20:26,583; ;A 75:25 read-write ratio means what percent of capacity should be in Tier 3?
170; ;00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:29,367; ;Remember that one?
171; ;00:20:30,376 --> 00:20:33,070; ;Seventy five percent, right? Good.
172; ;00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:34,661; ;Yeah. That's correct.
173; ;00:20:36,875 --> 00:20:42,282; ;All right, as we get into the next section here, let's start with a discussion.
174; ;00:20:42,282 --> 00:20:46,176; ;When sizing Tier 3, what is the main consideration?
175; ;00:20:48,805 --> 00:20:49,843; ;Capacity, right?
176; ;00:20:49,843 --> 00:20:50,846; ;Yep.
177; ;00:20:50,846 --> 00:20:53,229; ;That's the main thing you want to be concerned with in Tier 3.
178; ;00:20:55,569 --> 00:21:01,442; ;So our next sizing step is to fill in Tier 3 to meet the capacity needs.
179; ;00:21:01,442 --> 00:21:04,448; ;Okay, we'll look at what's all involved with that.
180; ;00:21:04,448 --> 00:21:09,239; ;So as we said, Tier 3 we want to size for capacity, okay?
181; ;00:21:10,515 --> 00:21:18,499; ;So our next objective, after we've got the proper performance, we want to make sure we have the right capacity, right?
182; ;00:21:18,499 --> 00:21:31,231; ;So, you know, a couple of things to meet the capacity, to try to figure out how much capacity they need is the customer's current usable capacity, right?
183; ;00:21:31,231 --> 00:21:34,711; ;What's the customer's current use capacity?
184; ;00:21:34,711 --> 00:21:41,400; ;What are they looking at in terms of snapshots, as we call them replays, and what is the expected growth?
185; ;00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:41,951; ;Alright, so we're going to get this information, you know, ideally from the customer.
What are they looking at in terms of snapshots, as we call them replays, and what is the expected growth?
186; ;00:21:41,951 --> 00:21:45,660; ;Alright, so we're going to get this information, you know, ideally from the customer.
187; ;00:21:45,665 --> 00:21:54,552; ;Hopefully, we can get as good of a guess as, you know, as we can get very often, that's the best thing that we can hope for, it's just kind of a swag, okay?
188; ;00:21:56,031 --> 00:22:02,488; ;So in our example here, kind of building on what we had talked about earlier on some earlier slides.
189; ;00:22:02,488 --> 00:22:09,754; ;If you remember what we said, the customer has specified the desire to have at least 48 terabytes of usable space.
190; ;00:22:09,754 --> 00:22:19,105; ;And as we said, there also needs to be room to allow for replay space, so that took us up to 58 terabytes.
191; ;00:22:19,105 --> 00:22:24,520; ;Basing it on 20% growth rate would guess, if you recall...
192; ;00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:35,610; ;Sorry, 20% change rate which means replays, that's going to add 9.6 terabytes, so that's what got us up to our 58 terabytes.
193; ;00:22:35,610 --> 00:22:50,689; ;Okay, now again, we're not sure what the growth rate is but, again, we're thinking 20% there as well, so we'll add an additional 9.6 terabytes, so now we're up to 68 terabytes total, okay?
194; ;00:22:50,689 --> 00:22:57,525; ;So those are some assumptions that we're making, 20% growth rate and 20% change rate.
195; ;00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:11,735; ;And based on that, we're going to look at how the system treats information, sort of back-end information if you will, RAID overhead, for example.
196; ;00:23:11,735 --> 00:23:22,542; ;So data in Tier 1 will be RAID 10 and RAID 5-9 using single redundancy or RAID 10 dual mirror and RAID 6-10.
197; ;00:23:23,814 --> 00:23:26,520; ;Okay, now these are using the recommended what...
198; ;00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:31,097; ;This is a picture of, if you haven't seen it, this is a storage profile.
199; ;00:23:31,097 --> 00:23:40,448; ;And we're basing the information on RAID here based on the recommended storage profile.
200; ;00:23:40,448 --> 00:23:43,855; ;And most of our customers use the recommended storage profile.
201; ;00:23:44,873 --> 00:23:45,897; ;Right.
202; ;00:23:45,897 --> 00:23:56,293; ;Not everybody, again, but probably 75% to 80% of our customers use the recommended storage profile and this is what the recommended storage profile means.
203; ;00:23:56,293 --> 00:24:01,965; ;And that is the data in Tier 3, it's going to be RAID 6-10, that's dual redundancy.
204; ;00:24:03,553 --> 00:24:10,313; ;Data in Tier 1 will be typically split between RAID 10 and 5-9 or RAID 10 dual mirror and 6-10.
205; ;00:24:10,313 --> 00:24:19,009; ;And this is going to be based on the read-write percent and remember the replay space is calculated in Tier 3
206; ;00:24:19,009 --> 00:24:31,146; ;So that 20 terabytes of growth space that we talked about, the 20 terabytes of replay space, majority is going to be allocated into Tier 3, especially the replay space for sure.
207; ;00:24:31,146 --> 00:24:37,499; ;The growth space, some of that can be in Tier 1 but we'll just figure 20 terabytes down in Tier 3.
208; ;00:24:37,499 --> 00:24:54,814; ;All right, so given that, this is the kind of the base information we've got, if 146 gig 15,000 RPM drives are selected, right, that ends up being 5.65 terabytes of usable space, again, which is only about half of what we need, right?
209; ;00:24:54,814 --> 00:25:02,448; ;So we end up going with 300 gig 15,000 RPM and this is in the ideal range, okay?
210; ;00:25:02,448 --> 00:25:17,335; ;So just continuing on with this, and this is an example of what we had talked about earlier so, if anything, this is just to sort of reinforce what we talked about before, okay, adding the growth rate along with the replay rate, okay?
211; ;00:25:17,335 --> 00:25:26,740; ;So using that 300 gigabyte 15,000 RPM drive in Tier 1, we're now going to look at Tier 3, okay?
212; ;00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:38,878; ;And so we need 68 terabytes of space in total, right, including growth and replay and we used 11.56 of that in Tier 1, so we need an additional...
213; ;00:25:40,082 --> 00:25:45,217; ;The math ends up being 56.44 terabytes, okay?
214; ;00:25:45,217 --> 00:25:55,600; ;And then by selecting a 1 terabyte drive, then we get close to that, we actually get 68.20 terabytes, okay?
215; ;00:25:55,600 --> 00:26:01,073; ;Which is 68 terabytes, as you recall, was our goal, okay.
216; ;00:26:01,073 --> 00:26:13,831; ;So again, there are different options that you want to use here, but that's just one of the ways of coming up with an answer from the standpoint of sizing for capacity.
217; ;00:26:15,934 --> 00:26:29,503; ;So we want to include this chart because it calls attention to the difference between what drive manufacturers say that the available advertised space is, and the actual space on an individual drive.
218; ;00:26:29,503 --> 00:26:35,394; ;So you can see the advertised space on the left and this is what, for the most part, you and I are familiar with.
219; ;00:26:35,394 --> 00:26:42,521; ;This whole module, we've spoken in these numbers, and what they are, right, is base 10 numbers, okay?
220; ;00:26:42,521 --> 00:26:48,202; ;And that's what drive capacities are measured in and that's what the manufacturers measure them in.
221; ;00:26:48,202 --> 00:26:55,397; ;But most operating systems and file systems represent disk capacity in base 8 numbers, right?
222; ;00:26:55,397 --> 00:27:00,508; ;This is due to the 8-bit byte on which CPUs and software are designed.
223; ;00:27:00,508 --> 00:27:07,908; ;So the difference between base 10 gigabyte and base 8 gigabyte is about 7%.
224; ;00:27:07,908 --> 00:27:17,125; ;So when you're calculating the amount of storage needed for each tier of the solution being designed, you know, this discrepancy needs to be accommodated.
225; ;00:27:17,125 --> 00:27:28,953; ;Okay, so the easiest way to do it is you just take the stated capacity and multiply it by it's actually 0.931, okay?
226; ;00:27:28,953 --> 00:27:35,504; ;To be more specific, it is 0.93132257461548, okay?
227; ;00:27:35,504 --> 00:27:47,594; ;So as an example here then, you see 1000 gigabyte or 1 terabyte of advertised space is going to be 931.57 actual space.
228; ;00:27:47,594 --> 00:27:56,208; ;Now as it says over here on the right, online sizing calculators account for this difference, so you don't have to figure this when you're calculating it.
229; ;00:27:56,208 --> 00:28:07,982; ;Now if you're manually doing a calculation or manually doing sizing, you will want to take this 7% difference into account, okay?
230; ;00:28:07,982 --> 00:28:12,113; ;So that's really the way that you want to look at it.
231; ;00:28:12,113 --> 00:28:26,847; ;So when you're determining how many drives are required to store a certain amount of data, you know, multiply the amount of data, right, whether that's from DPACK or whatever, to be stored by 1.073.
232; ;00:28:27,941 --> 00:28:31,797; ;Right? And that will give you the actual space in binary.
233; ;00:28:33,584 --> 00:28:41,043; ;So now, we've determined the number of drives needed to provide adequate performance and capacity has been determined.
234; ;00:28:41,043 --> 00:28:46,846; ;Let's review the designs in terms of a couple of adjustments you might think about.
235; ;00:28:46,846 --> 00:28:52,598; ;So review this design in terms of how many spares do you need, okay?
236; ;00:28:52,598 --> 00:29:01,373; ;Now, another one that often is overlooked is how feasible is it to get active drive counts to a multiple of the RAID in that particular tier.
237; ;00:29:02,377 --> 00:29:08,455; ;Are we leaving one or two open drive bays, and then what about dual redundancy?
238; ;00:29:08,455 --> 00:29:18,139; ;Okay, so hot spare recommendations, so for most configurations, plan on one hot spare per 25 drives...
239; ;00:29:18,139 --> 00:29:21,218; ;Excuse me, 24 drives of the same drive type.
240; ;00:29:21,218 --> 00:29:32,412; ;Now this could be again depending on, you know, the deal and where you're at, it could be anywhere from 24 to maybe even up as high as 36.
241; ;00:29:32,412 --> 00:29:37,824; ;And again, this will depend on, for example, the quote tool.
242; ;00:29:37,824 --> 00:29:44,899; ;The quoting tool will actually size for one hot spare per enclosure, right?
243; ;00:29:44,899 --> 00:29:48,531; ;So if you have an enclosure with 3.5-inch drives in them, right, guess what?
244; ;00:29:48,531 --> 00:29:52,997; ;You're going to have 12 drives in the enclosure.
245; ;00:29:52,997 --> 00:29:56,812; ;It's not a requirement that you have a hot spare in there, okay?
246; ;00:29:56,812 --> 00:30:04,602; ;So as you're doing sizing, keep in mind this figure of one spare per 24 drives of the same drive type.
247; ;00:30:04,602 --> 00:30:17,509; ;Okay, so In that case, if there was a 3.5-inch drives with the same, you had two different enclosures fully populated with 12 drives in each, all you need is one spare across those two enclosures.
248; ;00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:34,920; ;So certainly depending on the size of the drive, you know, if you're talking about 6 terabyte drives for example, having 1 hot spare per twenty-four is a huge difference than having 1 hot spare for 12 and another hot spare for another 12, right?
249; ;00:30:34,925 --> 00:30:36,661; ;Okay.
250; ;00:30:36,661 --> 00:30:40,739; ;So this can be, you know, that is an example of how cost can come into play.
251; ;00:30:40,739 --> 00:30:46,955; ;Okay, so can the design be improved and still stay within the customer's budget, okay?
252; ;00:30:46,955 --> 00:30:56,407; ;So for example, here, mid to large configurations, it says when possible, try to match the active drive count to the largest RAID type in the tier.
253; ;00:30:56,407 --> 00:31:10,754; ;Okay, so for example, RAID 5-9, if you're going to have RAID 5-9 in a tier, if you can get to an active drives in multiples of 9, that's ideal.
254; ;00:31:10,754 --> 00:31:18,326; ;Not a requirement but it's ideal, okay, because remember we're striping across all the drives on a given tier, right?
255; ;00:31:18,326 --> 00:31:20,942; ;So if we can get to multiples of nine, that's great.
256; ;00:31:24,916 --> 00:31:29,330; ;And then 6-10, another example, active drives in multiples of 10.
257; ;00:31:29,330 --> 00:31:33,565; ;So if you're talking about RAID 10, you're just talking about multiples of 2.
258; ;00:31:33,565 --> 00:31:49,690; ;So if we're talking single redundancy in Tier 1, we're talking about, you know, like 18 drives, you wouldn't want to use necessarily just 9 because again that's going to be an odd number when you're talking about RAID 10.
259; ;00:31:49,690 --> 00:32:03,178; ;Okay, so it may not be feasible in every case, but this is something that can be built into the design that will help down the road as far as saving space, okay?
260; ;00:32:04,655 --> 00:32:15,081; ;Again, if you look at drive quantities, sometimes it would be appropriate to add two additional 15K drives and three 7K drives for hot spares.
261; ;00:32:15,081 --> 00:32:19,626; ;It might also be appropriate to add three additional active 7K drives.
262; ;00:32:19,626 --> 00:32:25,770; ;Again, this is going to give us benefit by filling up those empty drive bays, okay?
263; ;00:32:25,770 --> 00:32:36,575; ;Now It's going to, again, increase the cost of the system so you have to be mindful of that, and that's why we said, it kind of comes down to cost and where the customer's budget is.
264; ;00:32:36,575 --> 00:32:44,104; ;Again, we've talked about dual redundancy a few times considering the implications, but again, keep in mind that dual redundancy...
265; ;00:32:44,104 --> 00:32:54,574; ;Now this is starting with SCOS version 6.7, at least it may go back a little to 6.6 or 6.5 but in 6.7 for sure dual...
266; ;00:32:54,574 --> 00:33:01,122; ;Any drives that are larger than 2 terabytes in a particular tier is going to force dual redundancy.
267; ;00:33:02,224 --> 00:33:11,256; ;So for example, if RAID 10 is being used in Tier 1, RAID 10 will actually be RAID 10 dual mirror.
268; ;00:33:11,256 --> 00:33:17,365; ;Remember, so instead of a two times multiplier that you want to use, it's a three times multiplier, okay?
269; ;00:33:17,365 --> 00:33:34,853; ;And we'll see that as now some new read-intensive drives are coming out with the latest read-intensive drive, the MRIs as it is referred to Mainstream Read-Intensive drives, the most recent one is 3.8 terabytes.
270; ;00:33:34,853 --> 00:33:41,694; ;So if you put that in, even if it was an all-flash array, if that's in 1 tier.
271; ;00:33:41,694 --> 00:33:49,228; ;It's going to be in Tier 1, you have to take that into account as it is going to do dual redundancy because of the size of the drive.
272; ;00:33:51,493 --> 00:33:54,518; ;So that's pretty much going to wrap up our discussion of capacity.
273; ;00:33:54,518 --> 00:34:05,311; ;So let's look at the next step in the SC Series sizing steps and that is determining number and type of front-end connections, okay?
274; ;00:34:05,311 --> 00:34:11,089; ;So before we enter into that information, let's look at a discussion question.
275; ;00:34:11,089 --> 00:34:12,657; ;What size for...
276; ;00:34:12,657 --> 00:34:19,927; ;When sizing for front-end, what throughput percent should be used, 95th, 99th or peak?
277; ;00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:23,657; ;If you remember that discussion from earlier.
278; ;00:34:23,657 --> 00:34:25,582; ;Right. That needs to be peak throughput.
279; ;00:34:25,582 --> 00:34:35,125; ;Remember, it was 95th percentile for IOs, peak throughput number for throughput, okay?
280; ;00:34:35,125 --> 00:34:36,441; ;So keep that in mind.
281; ;00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:40,188; ;Okay, Designing front-end connections.
282; ;00:34:40,188 --> 00:34:49,093; ;So remember, by definition, front-end connections are connections from the storage center SAN out to servers or hosts.
283; ;00:34:50,116 --> 00:34:51,571; ;Okay?
284; ;00:34:51,571 --> 00:34:55,534; ;Storage center maintains separate ports for incoming IO from servers,
285; ;00:34:55,534 --> 00:35:06,409; ;As we said, referred to as the front-end versus connectivity to the disks, which we refer to as the back-end, and that's the next sizing tool, the next sizing discussion we'll have, okay?
286; ;00:35:06,409 --> 00:35:13,765; ;The specific type of front-end connectivity will be frequently driven by what's in the customer environment, right?
287; ;00:35:13,765 --> 00:35:15,935; ;So does the customer have Fibre Channel?
288; ;00:35:17,292 --> 00:35:18,539; ;How about iSCSI?
289; ;00:35:20,863 --> 00:35:24,260; ;In the iSCSI environment, is it a software initiator?
290; ;00:35:24,260 --> 00:35:26,416; ;Is it a hardware?
291; ;00:35:26,416 --> 00:35:32,668; ;iSCSI hardware which basically is going to be a TCP off-load engine, you may have heard, that's a TOE card.
292; ;00:35:33,995 --> 00:35:36,362; ;Do they have FC over Ethernet?
293; ;00:35:36,362 --> 00:35:41,071; ;We don't see a lot of that in our environments, but it's worth a question.
294; ;00:35:41,071 --> 00:35:44,696; ;And what's their current infrastructure? Is it Fibre Channel? Is it iSCSI?
295; ;00:35:44,696 --> 00:35:49,193; ;Are they thinking of moving away from one or the other, okay.
296; ;00:35:49,193 --> 00:35:51,149; ;And that's one thing nice about the storage center, right.
297; ;00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:57,523; ;It can do Fibre Channel, iSCSI or FCoE out to host, okay?
298; ;00:35:57,523 --> 00:36:08,878; ;So what we have to figure out here in designing the front-end connectivity is we have to figure out the appropriate number of ports that must be in design to accommodate the workload, okay?
299; ;00:36:08,878 --> 00:36:22,181; ;So when we look at the data we use here, it should be total aggregated front-end traffic, megabytes, might even be in kilobytes, okay, depending on what, if it's DPACK or some other form of data collection.
300; ;00:36:23,461 --> 00:36:24,483; ;Okay?
301; ;00:36:24,483 --> 00:36:30,966; ;So after you get that collection, you have to determine what the front-end throughput is.
302; ;00:36:30,966 --> 00:36:39,897; ;You know, remember, as we just had on that discussion question, once the maximum throughput value is identified, it's possible to figure out how many front-end connections are required.
303; ;00:36:39,897 --> 00:36:44,132; ;Remember, we're looking at the peak front-end throughput.
304; ;00:36:44,132 --> 00:36:46,319; ;Okay, that's the big thing, okay?
305; ;00:36:48,438 --> 00:36:56,648; ;As we move forward, that's what we want to look at, right, from a DPACK report in particular, it's the peak amount of throughput.
306; ;00:36:58,409 --> 00:37:00,466; ;So let's take a look at the...
307; ;00:37:00,466 --> 00:37:15,125; ;When we're talking about designing front-end connections, this chart gives us kind of a general guidance on what the bandwidth is in theory what the interface is, and what the port bandwidth actually is.
308; ;00:37:15,125 --> 00:37:18,330; ;Okay, you know, again, this is an average...
309; ;00:37:18,330 --> 00:37:21,127; ;Your mileage may vary type of thing.
310; ;00:37:21,127 --> 00:37:25,869; ;But notice the difference, for example, 10 gig iSCSI is 600 megabytes per second.
311; ;00:37:27,182 --> 00:37:35,246; ;Okay, 1 gig iSCSI is 60 megabytes per second, so it's definitely not what the advertised throughput is, okay?
312; ;00:37:35,246 --> 00:37:45,383; ;So you want to use these approximate port bandwidth numbers to determine the number of front-end ports required, okay.
313; ;00:37:45,383 --> 00:37:50,657; ;To accommodate data traffic going in and out of the environment from the host.
314; ;00:37:50,657 --> 00:38:07,165; ;Now one thing to call out here, we don't say it in the chart itself, but all of these connectors here, Fibre Channel, iSCSI, FCoE, they all have to go through a switch of some kind, Fibre Channel, or an iSCSI or an Ethernet switch, right?
315; ;00:38:07,165 --> 00:38:17,950; ;Remember that an SCv2000 does have the option to use direct connect SAS, right, it's 12 gig SAS when it's connecting out to host.
316; ;00:38:19,034 --> 00:38:26,595; ;So in a couple of slides, we're going to talk about connecting to the back-end and from a standpoint of throughput.
317; ;00:38:26,595 --> 00:38:36,097; ;You want to keep those numbers in mind or refer to those if you have an SCv200 and you need to determine if the bandwidth considerations for...
318; ;00:38:36,097 --> 00:38:39,805; ;You know, that particular model because it does have SAS on the front end.
319; ;00:38:39,805 --> 00:38:46,759; ;Today it's the only one of the SC Series models that supports SAS out to servers.
320; ;00:38:48,582 --> 00:38:54,484; ;All right, let's look at some other considerations around designing front-end connections, okay?
321; ;00:38:54,484 --> 00:39:01,777; ;So again, you want to use DPACK or some other tool to analyze the customer's throughput between host and storage.
322; ;00:39:01,777 --> 00:39:09,770; ;Again, remember, keep in mind the network type, whether it's iSCSI, whether it's Fibre Channel, and what are those requirements.
323; ;00:39:09,770 --> 00:39:14,397; ;In other words, what speed of Fibre Channel is it? Is it 8 gig, is it 16 gig?
324; ;00:39:14,397 --> 00:39:21,325; ;Always remember to use the customer's peak throughput from those analysis tools, right?
325; ;00:39:21,325 --> 00:39:30,087; ;Design front-end requirements to have enough active ports to accommodate the customer's doubled bandwidth.
326; ;00:39:30,087 --> 00:39:35,444; ;That's what we say there, doubled is the customer's peak throughput when you're designing front-end ports.
327; ;00:39:35,444 --> 00:39:37,676; ;So why would you do that?
328; ;00:39:37,676 --> 00:39:42,835; ;All right, while you would do it in the scenario of a dual controller environment which again...
329; ;00:39:44,087 --> 00:39:54,604; ;80-85% of our customers have a dual controller environment, in that type of scenario, right, the controllers are active-active, meaning that they share the total front-end throughput.
330; ;00:39:54,604 --> 00:40:06,399; ;So if one of the controllers goes down, either for maintenance or there's some type of failure, the single remaining controller runs but it has to handle all of the front-end traffic.
331; ;00:40:06,399 --> 00:40:13,418; ;If one controller is down, does the customer expect to run smoothly on just the remaining controller?
332; ;00:40:13,418 --> 00:40:17,919; ;Right, if he does, the throughput number should be double.
333; ;00:40:17,919 --> 00:40:20,108; ;It's as simple as that, right?
334; ;00:40:20,108 --> 00:40:35,365; ;So if a customer only has one controller, if you're only sizing for one, maybe it's a DR site, maybe it's a very small implementation, yeah, then you wouldn't have to worry about this doubling of the front-end ports, okay?
335; ;00:40:35,365 --> 00:40:39,171; ;Another thing is determine if the front-end ports are going to be used for replication.
336; ;00:40:39,171 --> 00:40:45,017; ;So if they're doing replication, keep that in mind in terms of bandwidth, okay?
337; ;00:40:45,017 --> 00:40:53,931; ;Consider again the network type, again, most of our customers use iSCSI for replication, so how many ports are you going to have do you have for iSCSI?
338; ;00:40:53,931 --> 00:40:59,046; ;Do you have iSCSI to the host as well as for replication?
339; ;00:40:59,046 --> 00:41:04,673; ;Okay, so that's another thing to consider if you've got replication in the environment.
340; ;00:41:04,673 --> 00:41:17,823; ;One thing to keep in mind, it may be necessary to convert, depending on the tool, it may be necessary to convert kilobytes per second to megabytes per second to really get an accurate analysis if you've got the front-end sized properly.
341; ;00:41:19,512 --> 00:41:29,891; ;So let's look at an example of taking information from a tool and using it in coming up with a sizing consideration for the front-end.
342; ;00:41:29,891 --> 00:41:31,726; ;So here's a DPACK report.
343; ;00:41:31,726 --> 00:41:35,270; ;If you look at the DPACK report, there's a peak there of about...
344; ;00:41:35,270 --> 00:41:40,862; ;It's hard to tell exactly, but let's say about 1, 900 megabytes per second.
345; ;00:41:40,862 --> 00:41:46,697; ;Okay, so that's total, it's showing 1,900 reads, okay?
346; ;00:41:46,697 --> 00:41:52,195; ;So that's what about 2200, right, about 8 o'clock.
347; ;00:41:54,301 --> 00:42:09,926; ;Now that 1,900 megabytes per second, remember we're sizing to the peak for the front-end, so that 1,900 is sustainable by three 8 gig Fibre Channel FC ports or two 16 gig Fibre Channel FC ports, right?
348; ;00:42:09,926 --> 00:42:14,187; ;That means recommending a four port Fiber Channel card.
349; ;00:42:15,411 --> 00:42:17,153; ;Right? In the case of an 8 gig.
350; ;00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:24,236; ;Because the 16 gig Fiber Channel port cards are only dual port anyway, okay?
351; ;00:42:24,236 --> 00:42:36,682; ;So in either case, whether the customer has 8 gig Fibre Channel in their environment or if they've got 16 gig Fibre Channel I would recommend having a second card in the controller, right?
352; ;00:42:36,682 --> 00:42:49,981; ;Just for future expansion if nothing else, so that would mean you'd have two Fibre Channel cards Fibre Channel HBAs in both controllers, okay?
353; ;00:42:49,981 --> 00:42:56,176; ;Now another thing to keep in mind is the average IO size, you want to make sure that isn't getting abnormally large.
354; ;00:42:56,176 --> 00:42:57,998; ;So how do we figure that out?
355; ;00:42:57,998 --> 00:43:05,993; ;So average IO size can be determined by dividing the total IOPS into the megabytes per second, right?
356; ;00:43:05,993 --> 00:43:13,252; ;So if we look at, for example, the 6 o'clock timeframe which is a little more of an average time, we see about...
357; ;00:43:17,122 --> 00:43:21,479; ;The throughput is about 1,100 megabytes per second, okay?
358; ;00:43:21,479 --> 00:43:33,671; ;And this is going back to our example of 10,000 front-end IOPS, we don't see that on this chart, but 10,000 front-end IOPS throughput is about 1,100 megabytes.
359; ;00:43:33,671 --> 00:43:36,105; ;That's where the 1100 is coming from.
360; ;00:43:36,105 --> 00:43:37,935; ;Therefore... Oops.
361; ;00:43:39,806 --> 00:43:40,825; ;Sorry.
362; ;00:43:40,825 --> 00:43:53,627; ;Therefore, 1100 divided by 10,000 is 0.11 which is 11 kilobyte average block size that would be considered in the normal range.
363; ;00:43:53,627 --> 00:44:02,920; ;So what we're looking for there is if you're going well beyond that average block size, that could have a definite impact on front-end throughput.
364; ;00:44:05,184 --> 00:44:07,869; ;Let's take a look at a couple of review questions again.
365; ;00:44:08,882 --> 00:44:11,336; ;And we're going to go ahead and start with...
366; ;00:44:12,546 --> 00:44:17,528; ;A 10 gig iSCSI interface has about how much port bandwidth?
367; ;00:44:19,233 --> 00:44:21,512; ;We had that chart earlier. Yep.
368; ;00:44:21,512 --> 00:44:25,760; ;About 600 megabytes in a 10 gig interface.
369; ;00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:30,849; ;What is the recommended number of spares in an SC Series?
370; ;00:44:30,849 --> 00:44:31,968; ;And we talked about that.
371; ;00:44:33,668 --> 00:44:38,019; ;One spare per twenty-four drives of the same drive type.
372; ;00:44:39,538 --> 00:44:40,819; ;Okay, good.
373; ;00:44:40,819 --> 00:44:46,161; ;And then finally, what RAID types indicate dual redundancy is applied in a tier?
374; ;00:44:48,161 --> 00:44:49,957; ;A couple different ones, right?
375; ;00:44:49,957 --> 00:44:50,958; ;Yep.
376; ;00:44:50,958 --> 00:44:55,353; ;RAID 10 dual mirror and RAID 6.
377; ;00:44:55,353 --> 00:45:01,723; ;Remember that RAID 10 and RAID 5 are single redundancy.
378; ;00:45:01,723 --> 00:45:05,293; ;RAID 10 dual mirror, RAID 6 are dual redundancy.
379; ;00:45:07,168 --> 00:45:15,509; ;So the final sizing step in an SC Series is to determine the number of back-end connections.
380; ;00:45:17,626 --> 00:45:24,590; ;So we determined the number and type of the front-end, now it's time to determine the number of back-end connections.
381; ;00:45:24,590 --> 00:45:28,442; ;So when we talk about determining the number of back-end connections.
382; ;00:45:28,442 --> 00:45:43,213; ;One thing that makes it a little bit easier is the fact that when we're connecting to the back-end, and remember the back-end connectivity refers to the link between the storage center controllers and the disk enclosures, so that's a direct connection.
383; ;00:45:43,213 --> 00:45:50,957; ;It's just SAS connectivity, so there's no Fibre Channel, there's no iSCSI determining which is which.
384; ;00:45:50,957 --> 00:45:58,516; ;It's direct connect, so we're not going through a switch, it's direct connect on an SC9000 and an SC8000.
385; ;00:45:58,516 --> 00:46:03,632; ;We're directly connecting between the controllers and the enclosures.
386; ;00:46:03,632 --> 00:46:15,802; ;So our example here is this is two SC9000 controllers and we're directly connected to one, two, three, four enclosures, okay?
387; ;00:46:15,802 --> 00:46:24,858; ;And we've got two half-height SAS cards in each, those are the two SAS cards, one on the top, second one on the bottom.
388; ;00:46:24,858 --> 00:46:28,381; ;And then we're coming up with two chains based on how we're connecting them.
389; ;00:46:28,381 --> 00:46:34,231; ;So let's talk a little bit more about this SAS port technology that we're seeing here.
390; ;00:46:34,231 --> 00:46:41,022; ;One thing to be aware of, the one physical port actually contains four virtual ports.
391; ;00:46:41,022 --> 00:46:48,675; ;They're often referred to as lanes, but they are physically there and there are 12 gigs per lane.
392; ;00:46:48,675 --> 00:47:01,272; ;So you'll hear this term 12 gig SAS, but realistically, it's 48 gigs of available bandwidth if we're talking about the physical SAS port, okay?
393; ;00:47:04,207 --> 00:47:09,394; ;Now if you've got, as we know, there's a 2-port SAS card that we're seeing over here, right?
395; ;00:47:19,319 --> 00:47:33,241; ;384 drives as of this release, SCOS 7.0, when we developed this material, 192 drives per SAS chain was the max, okay?
397; ;00:47:39,270 --> 00:47:40,804; ;So keep that in mind.
396; ;00:47:33,241 --> 00:47:39,270; ;So again, that limit could certainly increase as future releases of SCOS come out.
394; ;00:47:09,394 --> 00:47:19,319; ;One 2-port SAS card provides two SAS chains, you can have one chain on each port, 96 gigs of bandwidth, right.
398; ;00:47:41,954 --> 00:47:47,483; ;Future growth is definitely possible as different releases of SCOS come out.
399; ;00:47:47,483 --> 00:47:54,707; ;Now when you're sizing the back-end on an SC9000, here are a couple of things to kind of consider.
400; ;00:47:54,707 --> 00:48:02,229; ;You want to double the front-end bandwidth and we'll give you a little example here of what that means, but you want to double what the front-end bandwidth is.
401; ;00:48:02,229 --> 00:48:09,806; ;When you do that doubling, you want to convert from megabytes per second to gigabits per second on the back-end.
402; ;00:48:09,806 --> 00:48:17,669; ;I'll kind of explain what that means, and then we'll kind of estimate the number of SAS chains needed based on that.
403; ;00:48:17,669 --> 00:48:30,441; ;So as an example here, if I've got 312 drives, so we did an analysis, we found 312 drives is what the customer needs.
404; ;00:48:30,441 --> 00:48:38,244; ;If we divide that by the maximum number of drives per chain, that's going to give us 1.6 chains.
405; ;00:48:38,244 --> 00:48:43,204; ;And of course, again, you can't 1.6 chains, so you round that up to two chains.
406; ;00:48:43,204 --> 00:48:52,161; ;So first of all, if you have a system with 312 drives, you would need 2 SAS chains at a minimum just to get all those drives on there.
407; ;00:48:52,161 --> 00:49:00,990; ;And certainly, it's a good idea to leave some room on the SAS chains, especially on a new installation, so you don't want to fill up all the drives anyway.
408; ;00:49:00,990 --> 00:49:09,333; ;You know, in our case here, so if we had 192 drives, even that you'd want to make it on 2 chains, okay?
409; ;00:49:09,333 --> 00:49:19,367; ;Now one thing to keep in mind as you're figuring out the number of chains, if you're familiar with the SC8000, we'll talk more specifically about the SC8000 next.
410; ;00:49:19,367 --> 00:49:31,146; ;But on the SC8000, you had a back-end interconnect, some of you may be familiar with, that back-end interconnect is no longer needed on the SC9000.
411; ;00:49:31,146 --> 00:49:43,763; ;And when we talk about the SC8000, we'll explain the purpose of that back-end interconnect when we get there, but that's something you don't need on the SC9000, okay?
412; ;00:49:43,763 --> 00:49:52,525; ;Now as we mentioned a moment ago, it's important to ensure that back-end bandwidth is double that amount of front-end bandwidth, okay?
413; ;00:49:52,525 --> 00:49:59,698; ;The reason for that is to allow for additional overhead incurred by RAID, right, when you're writing to the disk.
414; ;00:49:59,698 --> 00:50:05,510; ;Your performance needs would generally be met by a single SAS card in each controller, okay.
415; ;00:50:05,510 --> 00:50:10,777; ;But be certain that you meet this 2x bandwidth requirement that we're talking about, okay.
416; ;00:50:10,777 --> 00:50:22,908; ;So in our example of 312 drives, we said we needed to chains, but now it doesn't take into consideration IO traffic from the front-end ports, okay?
417; ;00:50:22,908 --> 00:50:28,256; ;Remember though, that traffic is flowing through the controllers and down to the drives.
418; ;00:50:28,256 --> 00:50:37,110; ;Okay, so to address that traffic from the front-end, we go back to the front-end throughput numbers that we've talked about a little earlier.
419; ;00:50:38,285 --> 00:50:47,072; ;So look at this example, assume our data gathering analysis showed 700 megabytes of front-end traffic, okay?
420; ;00:50:47,072 --> 00:50:52,919; ;So when sizing the front-end, remember that it should accommodate a minimum of 1400 megabytes, right?
421; ;00:50:52,919 --> 00:50:59,364; ;So then if a controller fails, it can fail to that second controller and everything will keep running fine.
422; ;00:50:59,364 --> 00:51:13,440; ;So in our example of 312 drives, remember we want double the throughput of 1,400 megabytes per second, so best practices would dictate a back-end configuration that looks like this.
423; ;00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:23,510; ;If the front-end bandwidth is 400 megabytes per second, right, then back-end bandwidth should be twice that or 2, 800 megabytes per second.
424; ;00:51:23,510 --> 00:51:36,201; ;And if you recall, we said we want to convert that to gigabits so that's going to be 22.4 gigabits per second that we're going to need keeping that front-end throughput in mind.
425; ;00:51:38,344 --> 00:51:39,734; ;Okay?
426; ;00:51:39,734 --> 00:51:46,832; ;So keep that in mind when you're designing your SAS back-end on an SC9000.
427; ;00:51:46,832 --> 00:51:51,082; ;So that's back-end connectivity for an SC9000.
428; ;00:51:51,082 --> 00:51:56,485; ;Let's look at back-end connectivity for the SC8000, okay?
429; ;00:51:56,485 --> 00:52:06,385; ;This is a picture here of an SC8000 and we're going to do very similar to what we did with the SC9000 and then we've got dual controller SC8000s and we've got four enclosures.
430; ;00:52:06,385 --> 00:52:10,913; ;We've got full height SAS cards here as opposed to the half-height we have on the SC9000.
431; ;00:52:10,913 --> 00:52:24,922; ;Notice, it might be little bit hard to tell, but there are actually four ports up here as opposed to two on the SC9000 and of course, the reason for that is SC8000 has 6 gig SAS.
432; ;00:52:24,922 --> 00:52:34,495; ;And just as we discussed a moment ago with the SC9000, there are four lanes and each lane is 6 gig per second, okay?
433; ;00:52:34,495 --> 00:52:43,559; ;So then we end up with the 24 gig throughput here, okay, because we've got 6 gig of SAS, right?
434; ;00:52:43,559 --> 00:52:53,455; ;Now, one 4-port SAS card provides two SAS chains, 96 gig of bandwidth, and again up to 384 drives.
435; ;00:52:53,455 --> 00:53:08,041; ;So just like we saw on the SC9000, potentially, we could go over that 192 max per chain down the line, but as of right now, as of version 7.0, that's the max that we're at.
436; ;00:53:08,041 --> 00:53:16,901; ;And as we talked about with the SC9000, same kind of rules apply in terms of making sure we don't saturate a chain adding another card to a second...
437; ;00:53:18,491 --> 00:53:23,693; ;To a second controller if you want to go that route, it'd be highly recommend it.
438; ;00:53:23,693 --> 00:53:35,803; ;Now one thing to keep in mind, we touched on this briefly on the SC9000, but plan on using one SAS chain on an SC8000 as an interconnect between the two controllers.
439; ;00:53:37,134 --> 00:53:42,063; ;Okay? There's only one back-end SAS chain being used for this, okay.
440; ;00:53:42,063 --> 00:53:47,476; ;So if there's only one, you have to make sure that you've got an interconnect set up.
441; ;00:53:47,476 --> 00:53:53,552; ;Okay, so what that does, it provides a high-speed link within the system for back-end functions.
442; ;00:53:53,552 --> 00:53:58,649; ;And as much as anything, it's for write-cache mirroring, okay?
443; ;00:53:58,649 --> 00:54:08,509; ;So if the system requires two or more back-end SAS chains for disk enclosures, you don't necessarily have to have that cross-connect SAS cable, okay?
444; ;00:54:08,509 --> 00:54:14,453; ;But it is something to kind of keep in mind especially if you have smaller systems, okay?
445; ;00:54:14,453 --> 00:54:28,523; ;And the same kind of considerations are here in terms of making sure that you have plenty of bandwidth, so you want to size that SAS back in, again, double the front-end bandwidth.
446; ;00:54:28,523 --> 00:54:34,119; ;When you're doing the calculation, remember you want to convert megabytes per second on the front-end and gigabits per second.
447; ;00:54:34,119 --> 00:54:42,096; ;Which is what it would be on the back-end and then give yourself an estimate of the number of SAS chains needed.
1; ;00:00:01,556 --> 00:00:07,057; ;What do you think is step one in the process of sizing an SC Series solution?
2; ;00:00:07,057 --> 00:00:15,775; ;As you might guess, this next section coming up here is going to look at some of the steps involved in determining the sizing.
3; ;00:00:15,775 --> 00:00:21,133; ;So our answer here is, gather and interpret customer performance requirements.
4; ;00:00:21,133 --> 00:00:25,042; ;If you step back and think about it, you go, "Yeah, that kind of makes sense." Right?
5; ;00:00:25,042 --> 00:00:28,963; ;You have to get the requirements first before you can go forward.
6; ;00:00:28,963 --> 00:00:35,559; ;So let's look at process step by step and what's involved in sizing.
7; ;00:00:35,559 --> 00:00:47,014; ;So, there are really five different sizing steps that we're going to take a look at, so the first one is gather and interpret customer performance requirements.
8; ;00:00:48,471 --> 00:01:05,497; ;We're going to design first to meet the IOPS needed, fill in Tier 3 to meet the capacity needs, determine the number and type of front-end connections required, and determine the number of back-end connections required.
9; ;00:01:07,727 --> 00:01:12,934; ;So we're going to start by gather and interpret customer performance requirements.
10; ;00:01:15,016 --> 00:01:17,172; ;So data gathering.
11; ;00:01:17,172 --> 00:01:21,756; ;Now, as we've said, there are many methods of data gathering, okay?
12; ;00:01:21,756 --> 00:01:28,234; ;Really the choice of how you get this information is really on a personal preference, okay?
13; ;00:01:28,234 --> 00:01:35,474; ;Here are some of the things that you're going to need to make sure to keep an eye on, and that is determine the acceptable latency.
14; ;00:01:35,474 --> 00:01:40,697; ;As much as anything, this might be something that comes from the customer, okay?
15; ;00:01:43,804 --> 00:01:48,720; ;Load is measured in terms of IOPS, right?
16; ;00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:53,415; ;Throughput is measured in terms of megabytes per second.
17; ;00:01:53,415 --> 00:01:56,600; ;Okay, those are a couple of terms that you want to keep in mind.
18; ;00:01:56,600 --> 00:02:01,349; ;Load equates to IOPS and throughput equates to...
19; ;00:02:01,349 --> 00:02:02,853; ;Okay, let me bring up this here.
20; ;00:02:02,853 --> 00:02:04,372; ;So, this is what we're talking about.
21; ;00:02:04,372 --> 00:02:11,325; ;Load is measured in terms of IOPS, throughput is measured in terms of megabytes, okay?
22; ;00:02:11,325 --> 00:02:18,250; ;So performance expectation, very often, is based on latency, okay?
23; ;00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:22,386; ;Front-end IOPS can help gauge the maximum back-end load.
24; ;00:02:24,732 --> 00:02:29,004; ;Okay, and then couple of defaults in the SC Series.
25; ;00:02:29,004 --> 00:02:36,601; ;Writes go to Tier 1 at RAID 10 or RAID 10 dual mirror depending if you have single or dual redundancy.
26; ;00:02:36,601 --> 00:02:43,933; ;And you'll always use 2x factor for write IOs, right, because we are dualing data and then mirror, right?
27; ;00:02:43,933 --> 00:02:49,428; ;So that's like two writes there when we're writing into Tier 1, okay?
28; ;00:02:50,967 --> 00:02:56,643; ;So it's real critical that you're looking, here's a good point here.
29; ;00:02:56,643 --> 00:03:02,013; ;When you're sizing, if you're sizing below peak when the sample time is done in seconds.
30; ;00:03:02,013 --> 00:03:08,608; ;Now, again, very often, when we're sizing for an SC Series, we're going to be using Dell's DPACK tool.
31; ;00:03:08,608 --> 00:03:13,599; ;And we're going to talk, we've got some slides coming up to talk a little more about DPACK.
32; ;00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:26,102; ;But that isn't the only tool you can use, but if you're using DPACK, you want to size below peak when the sample time is in seconds, size to peak when the sample time is in minutes.
33; ;00:03:27,123 --> 00:03:29,209; ;And so these are some of the things to keep in mind.
34; ;00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:37,100; ;Always investigate sustained IO spikes, are they caused by backups, is it caused by, you know, highly sequential IO.
35; ;00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:43,804; ;Remember, when we're sizing with an SC Series, we're looking at random IO, okay?
36; ;00:03:45,069 --> 00:03:50,182; ;And certainly different applications will have different performance expectations, right?
37; ;00:03:50,182 --> 00:04:00,506; ;There's an example, if I'm doing Microsoft Exchange, it requires less than 20 milliseconds of latency on database volumes.
38; ;00:04:00,506 --> 00:04:07,247; ;And write latency on transaction log volumes has to be less than 10 milliseconds, okay?
39; ;00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:15,355; ;So, whichever method you use, whether it's DPACK or something else, you really want to look for the same type of information, okay?
40; ;00:04:18,853 --> 00:04:23,688; ;So let's run through a couple of review questions here covering the last few slides that we talked about.
41; ;00:04:23,688 --> 00:04:33,248; ;If capacity needs to be added, let's say, six months after we've already done an installation of a multi-tier SC system, what tier are those drives added to?
42; ;00:04:34,935 --> 00:04:36,355; ;Yep, you probably know that one.
43; ;00:04:36,355 --> 00:04:38,089; ;Tier 3. Good.
44; ;00:04:39,406 --> 00:04:46,141; ;How about six months after initial installation, I want more performance, what tier are those drives added to?
45; ;00:04:47,343 --> 00:04:48,722; ;Yep.
46; ;00:04:48,722 --> 00:04:50,544; ;Tier 1. Good.
47; ;00:04:52,223 --> 00:04:57,316; ;So why is it not a good idea to size an SC Series to the bare minimums?
48; ;00:04:57,316 --> 00:04:59,395; ;Well, we talked about this earlier.
49; ;00:04:59,395 --> 00:05:07,214; ;The customer is not going to be happy if their system grows and this will generate multiple support calls because of poor performance.
50; ;00:05:07,214 --> 00:05:12,699; ;And as we said, it's going to be difficult for the support folks to troubleshoot these issues.
51; ;00:05:12,699 --> 00:05:17,216; ;And certainly, the customer is probably not going to want to hear what the support people have to say.
52; ;00:05:17,216 --> 00:05:19,553; ;So, good.
53; ;00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:22,766; ;All right, discussion question here.
54; ;00:05:22,766 --> 00:05:28,212; ;What Dell tool is an important part of sizing an SC Series solution properly?
55; ;00:05:28,212 --> 00:05:31,551; ;All right, so we talked about this already. DPACK.
56; ;00:05:31,551 --> 00:05:34,894; ;We're going to talk a little bit more about DPACK here in the next few slides.
57; ;00:05:34,894 --> 00:05:40,126; ;But let's define what it is, right?
58; ;00:05:40,126 --> 00:05:44,892; ;So DPACK stands for Dell Performance Analysis Kit.
59; ;00:05:44,892 --> 00:05:53,140; ;Okay, it is a no cost workload performance analysis tool from Dell using open standards.
60; ;00:05:53,868 --> 00:06:03,320; ;Well, the significance of the open standards is that this is actually can be used in any environment.
61; ;00:06:03,323 --> 00:06:15,175; ;So we often see even systems that might have some other type of storage vendor in it, we use DPACK to try to analyze the sizing of their performance tool, okay?
62; ;00:06:15,175 --> 00:06:25,032; ;It's a highly interactive web interface takes advantage of HTML 5, so you can look at the tool from any device.
63; ;00:06:25,032 --> 00:06:28,459; ;Data is transmitted in near real-time, okay?
64; ;00:06:28,459 --> 00:06:36,555; ;So it's a lightweight, remote, agent-less tool, okay?
65; ;00:06:36,555 --> 00:06:44,465; ;The current revision of DPACK, and DPACK is constantly going through updates, right, so DPACK 2 is the current version.
66; ;00:06:44,465 --> 00:06:52,206; ;There is training available for DPACK 2, online-based training if you need to learn a little bit more about it.
67; ;00:06:52,206 --> 00:07:04,329; ;But it's very critical, really a critical piece in determining what size a customer's SC Series array at.
68; ;00:07:06,746 --> 00:07:22,526; ;So as we look at DPACK analysis, it's really a good idea to have DPACK record a system, a customer's environment for multiple days, right, rather than just a consistent period of time.
69; ;00:07:22,526 --> 00:07:27,330; ;Very often we hear, "We want to wait until the end of the month to capture a process."
70; ;00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:38,286; ;The problem is this process very likely is just a subset or likely overshadowed by different maintenance activities, backup, and other maintenance things that occur throughout the month.
71; ;00:07:38,286 --> 00:07:57,670; ;So instead of waiting for that end-of-month period, run a 24-hour collection, you know, and just continue on from a salesperson point of view, from a Dell salesperson slant, just keep working the sales processes you normally would.
72; ;00:07:57,670 --> 00:08:10,730; ;But again, try to run and try to get another DPACK for another 24, you know, you might do it three or four times, three or four different days in a month, perhaps, even longer periods of time if you need to.
73; ;00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:14,890; ;But I wouldn't put it on a particular set period of time.
74; ;00:08:14,890 --> 00:08:20,637; ;It's not going to give you an accurate reflection of what's happening in the environment on a continual basis.
75; ;00:08:23,526 --> 00:08:26,795; ;Okay, so we've gathered up the information with DPACK.
76; ;00:08:26,795 --> 00:08:30,569; ;Our next step of the process is the actual design.
77; ;00:08:30,569 --> 00:08:34,943; ;So remember, we want to design first to meet the IOPS needed.
78; ;00:08:34,943 --> 00:08:37,653; ;So this is almost by way of review.
79; ;00:08:37,653 --> 00:08:43,153; ;When designing Tier 1 for the IOPS load, what are some things to kind of keep in mind?
80; ;00:08:44,969 --> 00:08:47,256; ;You will hit these coming up here, but...
81; ;00:08:48,500 --> 00:09:01,063; ;Yep, couple of things, total IOPS needed, average IO size, it's the block size, read versus write ratio, and expected growth, right?
82; ;00:09:01,063 --> 00:09:09,136; ;These are all things that you want to keep in mind when you're sizing for the load in Tier 1.
83; ;00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:23,070; ;Okay, so adjust the IOPS for RAID and read-write ratio, then size Tier 1 for the IOPS and the remaining capacity goes into Tier 3.
84; ;00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:24,588; ;We've talked a lot about that.
85; ;00:09:24,588 --> 00:09:29,739; ;Again, this whole idea of making sure that you're sizing for a Tier 1 first.
86; ;00:09:29,739 --> 00:09:33,602; ;Apply the read-write ratio to the IOPS requirements, okay?
87; ;00:09:33,602 --> 00:09:38,770; ;That's going to come typically from DPACK or some other tool used for gathering.
88; ;00:09:39,842 --> 00:09:47,808; ;Okay, remember, you want to multiply the write IOPS by two to take into account that RAID overhead, okay?
89; ;00:09:47,808 --> 00:09:51,493; ;Now this is, remember, single redundancy.
90; ;00:09:51,493 --> 00:10:00,082; ;If it's dual redundancy, you need to multiply the write IOPS by 3 for RAID 10 DM.
91; ;00:10:00,082 --> 00:10:04,736; ;Okay, so we're just looking at single redundancy in this case, so it would be multiply the write IOPS by 2.
92; ;00:10:07,204 --> 00:10:12,391; ;Okay? Then add read IOPS for total adjusted back-end IOPS.
93; ;00:10:12,391 --> 00:10:21,304; ;Again, you're getting all of this from that ratio that came from DPACK, again, showing the value, the critical nature of DPACK.
94; ;00:10:22,748 --> 00:10:34,218; ;Okay, as we said, you want to make sure in size Tier 1 for 100% of the adjusted IOPS, again, by adjusted, we're talking about the RAID 10, okay?
95; ;00:10:36,708 --> 00:10:40,379; ;Determine the capacity of Tier 1 after sizing for IOPS.
96; ;00:10:40,379 --> 00:10:45,398; ;So you've already sized for IOPS, now let's figure out the capacity that we need.
97; ;00:10:48,141 --> 00:10:50,909; ;Size Tier 3 for whatever's left over.
98; ;00:10:53,782 --> 00:11:03,109; ;Okay, so, kind of, as a rule of thumb, the capacity split between Tier 1 and Tier 3 should be approximately match the read-write ratio.
99; ;00:11:03,109 --> 00:11:15,734; ;Okay, so as an example here, if that read-write ratio coming from DPACK is 80:20, otherwise, 80% read, 20% write, that's typical environment.
100; ;00:11:15,734 --> 00:11:25,692; ;So how we'd want to size for capacity, then is 20% of the capacity should be in Tier 1 and the 80% should be in Tier 3.
101; ;00:11:27,133 --> 00:11:36,857; ;Okay, so using that read-write ratio in reverse to come up with the capacity necessary if I've got a two tier solution.
102; ;00:11:38,804 --> 00:11:43,400; ;Okay, so let's take a look at an example then of gathering IOPS.
103; ;00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:51,443; ;So this is a graph that we would have obtained from a sizing tool as we were gathering our information, right?
104; ;00:11:51,443 --> 00:11:56,037; ;So what this is telling us, let's just kind of take a look at... We've highlighted a few data points on here.
105; ;00:11:56,037 --> 00:12:00,720; ;So let's say at 9 pm, obviously you can tell this is a 24-hour graph, okay?
106; ;00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,933; ;Total IOPS are in blue, the yellow line is reads, and the red is writes.
So let's say at 9 pm, obviously you can tell this is a 24-hour graph, okay?
107; ;00:12:01,933 --> 00:12:11,190; ;Total IOPS are in blue, the yellow line is reads, and the red is writes.
108; ;00:12:11,197 --> 00:12:17,651; ;Okay, so at 9 o'clock, our front-end IOPS is 6,200, right about that.
109; ;00:12:17,651 --> 00:12:25,290; ;And that's comprised of 2,600 writes which we're seeing here, and 3,600 reads, okay?
110; ;00:12:26,669 --> 00:12:40,201; ;Now then at about 4 am, there is a front-end peak, right just shy of 6,000 IOPS, about 5,900 IOPS, with 4, 000 writes.
111; ;00:12:40,201 --> 00:12:44,240; ;Okay, so huge spike in writes and 1,900 reads.
112; ;00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:50,455; ;Okay, so if I'm factoring in the write penalty for these times, remember the write penalty is times 2.
113; ;00:12:50,455 --> 00:12:59,873; ;So I've got 2,600 here, times 2, plus 3,600 equals 8,800, right?
114; ;00:12:59,873 --> 00:13:02,633; ;So there is where the write penalty comes in.
115; ;00:13:03,864 --> 00:13:11,449; ;And then I've got the 4 am time, 4,000 times 2, okay?
116; ;00:13:11,449 --> 00:13:19,591; ;Plus the 1,900, right here, just shy of 2,000, you get 9,900 IOPS.
117; ;00:13:21,506 --> 00:13:24,943; ;Sorry. You get 9,900 IOPS, okay?
118; ;00:13:24,943 --> 00:13:27,927; ;These are points in time on which to focus.
119; ;00:13:29,234 --> 00:13:40,631; ;Okay, so this is where, again, one of the keys here is this is a good time to have a discussion with the customer about what's going on at 9 pm and 4 am.
120; ;00:13:40,631 --> 00:13:42,403; ;Are there mission critical apps going on?
121; ;00:13:42,403 --> 00:13:45,461; ;Are there backups going on, is there something else?
122; ;00:13:45,461 --> 00:13:56,563; ;And so, again, it's critical to understand the customer's environment and how important performance is and the critical nature of performance, that's imperative.
123; ;00:13:56,563 --> 00:14:02,922; ;So in this example, the target design is for approximately 10,000 IOPS on the back-end.
124; ;00:14:04,183 --> 00:14:15,793; ;So in this example, this is customer performance data that came from just a generic graph resulting from a third party data gathering tool, wasn't necessarily DPACK, right?
125; ;00:14:15,793 --> 00:14:24,459; ;Now one of the nice things about DPACK is it simplifies the analysis by providing a summary report, okay?
126; ;00:14:24,459 --> 00:14:34,921; ;So here you'll notice the summary report includes IOPS at peak as well as the IOPS at 95 percentile, also gives you the read-write ratio.
127; ;00:14:36,304 --> 00:14:45,823; ;Okay, so the same conversation needs to happen with the customer regarding the business drivers behind the delta between 95% and peak.
128; ;00:14:45,823 --> 00:14:53,027; ;So that's quite a significant difference there between 95% and peak, so you just want to have a discussion as to why that is.
129; ;00:14:53,027 --> 00:14:55,385; ;So this is the summary.
130; ;00:14:55,385 --> 00:15:00,426; ;Then from here, you can also break down individual servers, right?
131; ;00:15:00,426 --> 00:15:13,031; ;So this is another way of using this tool to try to analyze and figure out where the peaks are and what is the difference, okay?
132; ;00:15:14,814 --> 00:15:18,672; ;All right, this chart should look familiar to you.
133; ;00:15:18,672 --> 00:15:20,313; ;It's got the drive IOPS chart.
134; ;00:15:20,313 --> 00:15:28,951; ;The one difference here is we look at 50/50 read-write ratio and these are more actual numbers than we had seen before.
135; ;00:15:28,951 --> 00:15:41,267; ;But we want to just show this here because we want to look at the calculation that's involved with figuring out how many drives we need based on our IOPS that we need, okay?
136; ;00:15:41,267 --> 00:15:52,271; ;So what you want to do is, you divide the customer's adjusted IOPS, and remember adjusted IOPS would be the case of RAID 10 writes, that's two IOPS,
137; ;00:15:52,271 --> 00:15:59,265; ;But divide the customer's adjusted IOPS by the drive IOPS that you see on this chart here, okay?
138; ;00:15:59,265 --> 00:16:03,433; ;To determine how many drives are required to provide the needed performance.
139; ;00:16:04,825 --> 00:16:14,568; ;Okay, then you multiply the number of drives that we needed, that we came up with on the previous step, by the drive capacity listed,
140; ;00:16:14,568 --> 00:16:20,438; ;You know, to determine the overall, to determine the raw capacity that is necessary.
141; ;00:16:20,438 --> 00:16:30,605; ;Then you would adjust the drive type, drive count, and drive capacity until you meet the required IOPS and as well as the capacity.
142; ;00:16:30,605 --> 00:16:43,382; ;Okay, so this chart can be a great resource, but again, it's based on, you know, 50/50 read-write percent that may not be what DPACK tells us that the customer's environment is.
143; ;00:16:43,382 --> 00:16:50,468; ;So I'm going to give you a calculation here, that's actually a little bit more exact.
144; ;00:16:51,479 --> 00:16:55,633; ;To get a more defined result, let's use this calculation here.
145; ;00:16:55,633 --> 00:17:07,609; ;So you take the write seek time times the write percent, you add the read seek time times the read percent, plus the rotational latency.
146; ;00:17:09,322 --> 00:17:15,509; ;Okay, so whatever that result is you take 1 divided by that result, okay.
147; ;00:17:15,509 --> 00:17:28,316; ;And that will actually provide an IOPS number, that's more accurate, you know, for an individual customer's solution because it's going to take their environment into the calculation.
148; ;00:17:28,316 --> 00:17:42,681; ;Okay, so some of those numbers that I mentioned in that calculation, write seek, and read seek, rotational latency, all those things can be found on the drive manufacturer's website, okay?
149; ;00:17:42,681 --> 00:17:57,778; ;So, again, some of these calculations certainly they can be done manually, some people will use a spreadsheet, there's also online disk calculators, and we'll show you where you can get the online disk calculators later on in this module.
150; ;00:18:01,544 --> 00:18:04,763; ;So let's finish up our discussion about designing for IOPS.
151; ;00:18:04,763 --> 00:18:13,981; ;We're going to go back to this example, if you remember this example had ended up targeting 10,000 back-end IOPS.
152; ;00:18:13,981 --> 00:18:18,691; ;Okay, so to meet those 10,000 back-end IOPS.
153; ;00:18:18,691 --> 00:18:31,525; ;What we need is to look at our chart here and kind of determine how we can best deliver those IOPS in Tier 1, and, again, of course, later on, we'll have capacity growing to Tier 3.
154; ;00:18:31,525 --> 00:18:37,833; ;So if you were to start, for example, by taking the 2.5-inch 15,000 RPM drives.
155; ;00:18:37,833 --> 00:18:51,997; ;As we see they deliver approximately 206 IOPS, 206, 210 right in there, that would mean about 48 active spindles to get 10,000 IOPS.
156; ;00:18:51,997 --> 00:19:02,562; ;So to determine the size of the drives, consider how many Tier 3 drives will be used and how close the system is to the target capacity, okay?
157; ;00:19:02,562 --> 00:19:15,503; ;So to allow for another 2,000 IOPS in Tier 3, back to our original example, the system will need to have approximately 25, 7,200 RPM drives.
158; ;00:19:17,610 --> 00:19:19,142; ;Okay?
159; ;00:19:19,142 --> 00:19:35,425; ;So again, when you're to kind of sum up our design Tier 1 for IOPS load, you want to consider the total IOPS needed, the average size of the IOPS, the number of reads versus writes, and the expected growth rate.
160; ;00:19:35,425 --> 00:19:40,467; ;So taking all of those together will help get you an...
161; ;00:19:41,588 --> 00:19:50,706; ;It gets as close as possible, let's put it that way, to a proper number of IOPS to get the proper amount of performance from Tier 1.
162; ;00:19:53,372 --> 00:19:55,900; ;All right, let's take a look at a couple review questions here.
163; ;00:19:58,841 --> 00:20:04,998; ;Designing Tier 1 for an SC Series for the proper load means designing for what?
164; ;00:20:04,998 --> 00:20:07,407; ;All right, so what does load refer to?
165; ;00:20:07,407 --> 00:20:08,738; ;IOPS, right?
166; ;00:20:08,738 --> 00:20:10,575; ;Yep. Good.
167; ;00:20:10,575 --> 00:20:15,088; ;What data collection tool is lightweight, remote, and agent-less?
168; ;00:20:16,395 --> 00:20:18,737; ;And this should be an easy one. DPACK.
169; ;00:20:20,279 --> 00:20:26,583; ;A 75:25 read-write ratio means what percent of capacity should be in Tier 3?
170; ;00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:29,367; ;Remember that one?
171; ;00:20:30,376 --> 00:20:33,070; ;Seventy five percent, right? Good.
172; ;00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:34,661; ;Yeah. That's correct.
173; ;00:20:36,875 --> 00:20:42,282; ;All right, as we get into the next section here, let's start with a discussion.
174; ;00:20:42,282 --> 00:20:46,176; ;When sizing Tier 3, what is the main consideration?
175; ;00:20:48,805 --> 00:20:49,843; ;Capacity, right?
176; ;00:20:49,843 --> 00:20:50,846; ;Yep.
177; ;00:20:50,846 --> 00:20:53,229; ;That's the main thing you want to be concerned with in Tier 3.
178; ;00:20:55,569 --> 00:21:01,442; ;So our next sizing step is to fill in Tier 3 to meet the capacity needs.
179; ;00:21:01,442 --> 00:21:04,448; ;Okay, we'll look at what's all involved with that.
180; ;00:21:04,448 --> 00:21:09,239; ;So as we said, Tier 3 we want to size for capacity, okay?
181; ;00:21:10,515 --> 00:21:18,499; ;So our next objective, after we've got the proper performance, we want to make sure we have the right capacity, right?
182; ;00:21:18,499 --> 00:21:31,231; ;So, you know, a couple of things to meet the capacity, to try to figure out how much capacity they need is the customer's current usable capacity, right?
183; ;00:21:31,231 --> 00:21:34,711; ;What's the customer's current use capacity?
184; ;00:21:34,711 --> 00:21:41,400; ;What are they looking at in terms of snapshots, as we call them replays, and what is the expected growth?
185; ;00:21:41,951 --> 00:21:45,660; ;Alright, so we're going to get this information, you know, ideally from the customer.
186; ;00:21:45,665 --> 00:21:54,552; ;Hopefully, we can get as good of a guess as, you know, as we can get very often, that's the best thing that we can hope for, it's just kind of a swag, okay?
187; ;00:21:56,031 --> 00:22:02,488; ;So in our example here, kind of building on what we had talked about earlier on some earlier slides.
188; ;00:22:02,488 --> 00:22:09,754; ;If you remember what we said, the customer has specified the desire to have at least 48 terabytes of usable space.
189; ;00:22:09,754 --> 00:22:19,105; ;And as we said, there also needs to be room to allow for replay space, so that took us up to 58 terabytes.
190; ;00:22:19,105 --> 00:22:24,520; ;Basing it on 20% growth rate would guess, if you recall...
191; ;00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:35,610; ;Sorry, 20% change rate which means replays, that's going to add 9.6 terabytes, so that's what got us up to our 58 terabytes.
192; ;00:22:35,610 --> 00:22:50,689; ;Okay, now again, we're not sure what the growth rate is but, again, we're thinking 20% there as well, so we'll add an additional 9.6 terabytes, so now we're up to 68 terabytes total, okay?
193; ;00:22:50,689 --> 00:22:57,525; ;So those are some assumptions that we're making, 20% growth rate and 20% change rate.
194; ;00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:11,735; ;And based on that, we're going to look at how the system treats information, sort of back-end information if you will, RAID overhead, for example.
195; ;00:23:11,735 --> 00:23:22,542; ;So data in Tier 1 will be RAID 10 and RAID 5-9 using single redundancy or RAID 10 dual mirror and RAID 6-10.
196; ;00:23:23,814 --> 00:23:26,520; ;Okay, now these are using the recommended what...
197; ;00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:31,097; ;This is a picture of, if you haven't seen it, this is a storage profile.
198; ;00:23:31,097 --> 00:23:40,448; ;And we're basing the information on RAID here based on the recommended storage profile.
199; ;00:23:40,448 --> 00:23:43,855; ;And most of our customers use the recommended storage profile.
200; ;00:23:44,873 --> 00:23:45,897; ;Right.
201; ;00:23:45,897 --> 00:23:56,293; ;Not everybody, again, but probably 75% to 80% of our customers use the recommended storage profile and this is what the recommended storage profile means.
202; ;00:23:56,293 --> 00:24:01,965; ;And that is the data in Tier 3, it's going to be RAID 6-10, that's dual redundancy.
203; ;00:24:03,553 --> 00:24:10,313; ;Data in Tier 1 will be typically split between RAID 10 and 5-9 or RAID 10 dual mirror and 6-10.
204; ;00:24:10,313 --> 00:24:19,009; ;And this is going to be based on the read-write percent and remember the replay space is calculated in Tier 3
205; ;00:24:19,009 --> 00:24:31,146; ;So that 20 terabytes of growth space that we talked about, the 20 terabytes of replay space, majority is going to be allocated into Tier 3, especially the replay space for sure.
206; ;00:24:31,146 --> 00:24:37,499; ;The growth space, some of that can be in Tier 1 but we'll just figure 20 terabytes down in Tier 3.
207; ;00:24:37,499 --> 00:24:54,814; ;All right, so given that, this is the kind of the base information we've got, if 146 gig 15,000 RPM drives are selected, right, that ends up being 5.65 terabytes of usable space, again, which is only about half of what we need, right?
208; ;00:24:54,814 --> 00:25:02,448; ;So we end up going with 300 gig 15,000 RPM and this is in the ideal range, okay?
209; ;00:25:02,448 --> 00:25:17,335; ;So just continuing on with this, and this is an example of what we had talked about earlier so, if anything, this is just to sort of reinforce what we talked about before, okay, adding the growth rate along with the replay rate, okay?
210; ;00:25:17,335 --> 00:25:26,740; ;So using that 300 gigabyte 15,000 RPM drive in Tier 1, we're now going to look at Tier 3, okay?
211; ;00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:38,878; ;And so we need 68 terabytes of space in total, right, including growth and replay and we used 11.56 of that in Tier 1, so we need an additional...
212; ;00:25:40,082 --> 00:25:45,217; ;The math ends up being 56.44 terabytes, okay?
213; ;00:25:45,217 --> 00:25:55,600; ;And then by selecting a 1 terabyte drive, then we get close to that, we actually get 68.20 terabytes, okay?
214; ;00:25:55,600 --> 00:26:01,073; ;Which is 68 terabytes, as you recall, was our goal, okay.
215; ;00:26:01,073 --> 00:26:13,831; ;So again, there are different options that you want to use here, but that's just one of the ways of coming up with an answer from the standpoint of sizing for capacity.
216; ;00:26:15,934 --> 00:26:29,503; ;So we want to include this chart because it calls attention to the difference between what drive manufacturers say that the available advertised space is, and the actual space on an individual drive.
217; ;00:26:29,503 --> 00:26:35,394; ;So you can see the advertised space on the left and this is what, for the most part, you and I are familiar with.
218; ;00:26:35,394 --> 00:26:42,521; ;This whole module, we've spoken in these numbers, and what they are, right, is base 10 numbers, okay?
219; ;00:26:42,521 --> 00:26:48,202; ;And that's what drive capacities are measured in and that's what the manufacturers measure them in.
220; ;00:26:48,202 --> 00:26:55,397; ;But most operating systems and file systems represent disk capacity in base 8 numbers, right?
221; ;00:26:55,397 --> 00:27:00,508; ;This is due to the 8-bit byte on which CPUs and software are designed.
222; ;00:27:00,508 --> 00:27:07,908; ;So the difference between base 10 gigabyte and base 8 gigabyte is about 7%.
223; ;00:27:07,908 --> 00:27:17,125; ;So when you're calculating the amount of storage needed for each tier of the solution being designed, you know, this discrepancy needs to be accommodated.
224; ;00:27:17,125 --> 00:27:28,953; ;Okay, so the easiest way to do it is you just take the stated capacity and multiply it by it's actually 0.931, okay?
225; ;00:27:28,953 --> 00:27:35,504; ;To be more specific, it is 0.93132257461548, okay?
226; ;00:27:35,504 --> 00:27:47,594; ;So as an example here then, you see 1000 gigabyte or 1 terabyte of advertised space is going to be 931.57 actual space.
227; ;00:27:47,594 --> 00:27:56,208; ;Now as it says over here on the right, online sizing calculators account for this difference, so you don't have to figure this when you're calculating it.
228; ;00:27:56,208 --> 00:28:07,982; ;Now if you're manually doing a calculation or manually doing sizing, you will want to take this 7% difference into account, okay?
229; ;00:28:07,982 --> 00:28:12,113; ;So that's really the way that you want to look at it.
230; ;00:28:12,113 --> 00:28:26,847; ;So when you're determining how many drives are required to store a certain amount of data, you know, multiply the amount of data, right, whether that's from DPACK or whatever, to be stored by 1.073.
231; ;00:28:27,941 --> 00:28:31,797; ;Right? And that will give you the actual space in binary.
232; ;00:28:33,584 --> 00:28:41,043; ;So now, we've determined the number of drives needed to provide adequate performance and capacity has been determined.
233; ;00:28:41,043 --> 00:28:46,846; ;Let's review the designs in terms of a couple of adjustments you might think about.
234; ;00:28:46,846 --> 00:28:52,598; ;So review this design in terms of how many spares do you need, okay?
235; ;00:28:52,598 --> 00:29:01,373; ;Now, another one that often is overlooked is how feasible is it to get active drive counts to a multiple of the RAID in that particular tier.
236; ;00:29:02,377 --> 00:29:08,455; ;Are we leaving one or two open drive bays, and then what about dual redundancy?
237; ;00:29:08,455 --> 00:29:18,139; ;Okay, so hot spare recommendations, so for most configurations, plan on one hot spare per 25 drives...
238; ;00:29:18,139 --> 00:29:21,218; ;Excuse me, 24 drives of the same drive type.
239; ;00:29:21,218 --> 00:29:32,412; ;Now this could be again depending on, you know, the deal and where you're at, it could be anywhere from 24 to maybe even up as high as 36.
240; ;00:29:32,412 --> 00:29:37,824; ;And again, this will depend on, for example, the quote tool.
241; ;00:29:37,824 --> 00:29:44,899; ;The quoting tool will actually size for one hot spare per enclosure, right?
242; ;00:29:44,899 --> 00:29:48,531; ;So if you have an enclosure with 3.5-inch drives in them, right, guess what?
243; ;00:29:48,531 --> 00:29:52,997; ;You're going to have 12 drives in the enclosure.
244; ;00:29:52,997 --> 00:29:56,812; ;It's not a requirement that you have a hot spare in there, okay?
245; ;00:29:56,812 --> 00:30:04,602; ;So as you're doing sizing, keep in mind this figure of one spare per 24 drives of the same drive type.
246; ;00:30:04,602 --> 00:30:17,509; ;Okay, so In that case, if there was a 3.5-inch drives with the same, you had two different enclosures fully populated with 12 drives in each, all you need is one spare across those two enclosures.
247; ;00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:34,920; ;So certainly depending on the size of the drive, you know, if you're talking about 6 terabyte drives for example, having 1 hot spare per twenty-four is a huge difference than having 1 hot spare for 12 and another hot spare for another 12, right?
248; ;00:30:34,925 --> 00:30:36,661; ;Okay.
249; ;00:30:36,661 --> 00:30:40,739; ;So this can be, you know, that is an example of how cost can come into play.
250; ;00:30:40,739 --> 00:30:46,955; ;Okay, so can the design be improved and still stay within the customer's budget, okay?
251; ;00:30:46,955 --> 00:30:56,407; ;So for example, here, mid to large configurations, it says when possible, try to match the active drive count to the largest RAID type in the tier.
252; ;00:30:56,407 --> 00:31:10,754; ;Okay, so for example, RAID 5-9, if you're going to have RAID 5-9 in a tier, if you can get to an active drives in multiples of 9, that's ideal.
253; ;00:31:10,754 --> 00:31:18,326; ;Not a requirement but it's ideal, okay, because remember we're striping across all the drives on a given tier, right?
254; ;00:31:18,326 --> 00:31:20,942; ;So if we can get to multiples of nine, that's great.
255; ;00:31:24,916 --> 00:31:29,330; ;And then 6-10, another example, active drives in multiples of 10.
256; ;00:31:29,330 --> 00:31:33,565; ;So if you're talking about RAID 10, you're just talking about multiples of 2.
257; ;00:31:33,565 --> 00:31:49,690; ;So if we're talking single redundancy in Tier 1, we're talking about, you know, like 18 drives, you wouldn't want to use necessarily just 9 because again that's going to be an odd number when you're talking about RAID 10.
258; ;00:31:49,690 --> 00:32:03,178; ;Okay, so it may not be feasible in every case, but this is something that can be built into the design that will help down the road as far as saving space, okay?
259; ;00:32:04,655 --> 00:32:15,081; ;Again, if you look at drive quantities, sometimes it would be appropriate to add two additional 15K drives and three 7K drives for hot spares.
260; ;00:32:15,081 --> 00:32:19,626; ;It might also be appropriate to add three additional active 7K drives.
261; ;00:32:19,626 --> 00:32:25,770; ;Again, this is going to give us benefit by filling up those empty drive bays, okay?
262; ;00:32:25,770 --> 00:32:36,575; ;Now It's going to, again, increase the cost of the system so you have to be mindful of that, and that's why we said, it kind of comes down to cost and where the customer's budget is.
263; ;00:32:36,575 --> 00:32:44,104; ;Again, we've talked about dual redundancy a few times considering the implications, but again, keep in mind that dual redundancy...
264; ;00:32:44,104 --> 00:32:54,574; ;Now this is starting with SCOS version 6.7, at least it may go back a little to 6.6 or 6.5 but in 6.7 for sure dual...
265; ;00:32:54,574 --> 00:33:01,122; ;Any drives that are larger than 2 terabytes in a particular tier is going to force dual redundancy.
266; ;00:33:02,224 --> 00:33:11,256; ;So for example, if RAID 10 is being used in Tier 1, RAID 10 will actually be RAID 10 dual mirror.
267; ;00:33:11,256 --> 00:33:17,365; ;Remember, so instead of a two times multiplier that you want to use, it's a three times multiplier, okay?
268; ;00:33:17,365 --> 00:33:34,853; ;And we'll see that as now some new read-intensive drives are coming out with the latest read-intensive drive, the MRIs as it is referred to Mainstream Read-Intensive drives, the most recent one is 3.8 terabytes.
269; ;00:33:34,853 --> 00:33:41,694; ;So if you put that in, even if it was an all-flash array, if that's in 1 tier.
270; ;00:33:41,694 --> 00:33:49,228; ;It's going to be in Tier 1, you have to take that into account as it is going to do dual redundancy because of the size of the drive.
271; ;00:33:51,493 --> 00:33:54,518; ;So that's pretty much going to wrap up our discussion of capacity.
272; ;00:33:54,518 --> 00:34:05,311; ;So let's look at the next step in the SC Series sizing steps and that is determining number and type of front-end connections, okay?
273; ;00:34:05,311 --> 00:34:11,089; ;So before we enter into that information, let's look at a discussion question.
274; ;00:34:11,089 --> 00:34:12,657; ;What size for...
275; ;00:34:12,657 --> 00:34:19,927; ;When sizing for front-end, what throughput percent should be used, 95th, 99th or peak?
276; ;00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:23,657; ;If you remember that discussion from earlier.
277; ;00:34:23,657 --> 00:34:25,582; ;Right. That needs to be peak throughput.
278; ;00:34:25,582 --> 00:34:35,125; ;Remember, it was 95th percentile for IOs, peak throughput number for throughput, okay?
279; ;00:34:35,125 --> 00:34:36,441; ;So keep that in mind.
280; ;00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:40,188; ;Okay, Designing front-end connections.
281; ;00:34:40,188 --> 00:34:49,093; ;So remember, by definition, front-end connections are connections from the storage center SAN out to servers or hosts.
282; ;00:34:50,116 --> 00:34:51,571; ;Okay?
283; ;00:34:51,571 --> 00:34:55,534; ;Storage center maintains separate ports for incoming IO from servers,
284; ;00:34:55,534 --> 00:35:06,409; ;As we said, referred to as the front-end versus connectivity to the disks, which we refer to as the back-end, and that's the next sizing tool, the next sizing discussion we'll have, okay?
285; ;00:35:06,409 --> 00:35:13,765; ;The specific type of front-end connectivity will be frequently driven by what's in the customer environment, right?
286; ;00:35:13,765 --> 00:35:15,935; ;So does the customer have Fibre Channel?
287; ;00:35:17,292 --> 00:35:18,539; ;How about iSCSI?
288; ;00:35:20,863 --> 00:35:24,260; ;In the iSCSI environment, is it a software initiator?
289; ;00:35:24,260 --> 00:35:26,416; ;Is it a hardware?
290; ;00:35:26,416 --> 00:35:32,668; ;iSCSI hardware which basically is going to be a TCP off-load engine, you may have heard, that's a TOE card.
291; ;00:35:33,995 --> 00:35:36,362; ;Do they have FC over Ethernet?
292; ;00:35:36,362 --> 00:35:41,071; ;We don't see a lot of that in our environments, but it's worth a question.
293; ;00:35:41,071 --> 00:35:44,696; ;And what's their current infrastructure? Is it Fibre Channel? Is it iSCSI?
294; ;00:35:44,696 --> 00:35:49,193; ;Are they thinking of moving away from one or the other, okay.
295; ;00:35:49,193 --> 00:35:51,149; ;And that's one thing nice about the storage center, right.
296; ;00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:57,523; ;It can do Fibre Channel, iSCSI or FCoE out to host, okay?
297; ;00:35:57,523 --> 00:36:08,878; ;So what we have to figure out here in designing the front-end connectivity is we have to figure out the appropriate number of ports that must be in design to accommodate the workload, okay?
298; ;00:36:08,878 --> 00:36:22,181; ;So when we look at the data we use here, it should be total aggregated front-end traffic, megabytes, might even be in kilobytes, okay, depending on what, if it's DPACK or some other form of data collection.
299; ;00:36:23,461 --> 00:36:24,483; ;Okay?
300; ;00:36:24,483 --> 00:36:30,966; ;So after you get that collection, you have to determine what the front-end throughput is.
301; ;00:36:30,966 --> 00:36:39,897; ;You know, remember, as we just had on that discussion question, once the maximum throughput value is identified, it's possible to figure out how many front-end connections are required.
302; ;00:36:39,897 --> 00:36:44,132; ;Remember, we're looking at the peak front-end throughput.
303; ;00:36:44,132 --> 00:36:46,319; ;Okay, that's the big thing, okay?
304; ;00:36:48,438 --> 00:36:56,648; ;As we move forward, that's what we want to look at, right, from a DPACK report in particular, it's the peak amount of throughput.
305; ;00:36:58,409 --> 00:37:00,466; ;So let's take a look at the...
306; ;00:37:00,466 --> 00:37:15,125; ;When we're talking about designing front-end connections, this chart gives us kind of a general guidance on what the bandwidth is in theory what the interface is, and what the port bandwidth actually is.
307; ;00:37:15,125 --> 00:37:18,330; ;Okay, you know, again, this is an average...
308; ;00:37:18,330 --> 00:37:21,127; ;Your mileage may vary type of thing.
309; ;00:37:21,127 --> 00:37:25,869; ;But notice the difference, for example, 10 gig iSCSI is 600 megabytes per second.
310; ;00:37:27,182 --> 00:37:35,246; ;Okay, 1 gig iSCSI is 60 megabytes per second, so it's definitely not what the advertised throughput is, okay?
311; ;00:37:35,246 --> 00:37:45,383; ;So you want to use these approximate port bandwidth numbers to determine the number of front-end ports required, okay.
312; ;00:37:45,383 --> 00:37:50,657; ;To accommodate data traffic going in and out of the environment from the host.
313; ;00:37:50,657 --> 00:38:07,165; ;Now one thing to call out here, we don't say it in the chart itself, but all of these connectors here, Fibre Channel, iSCSI, FCoE, they all have to go through a switch of some kind, Fibre Channel, or an iSCSI or an Ethernet switch, right?
314; ;00:38:07,165 --> 00:38:17,950; ;Remember that an SCv2000 does have the option to use direct connect SAS, right, it's 12 gig SAS when it's connecting out to host.
315; ;00:38:19,034 --> 00:38:26,595; ;So in a couple of slides, we're going to talk about connecting to the back-end and from a standpoint of throughput.
316; ;00:38:26,595 --> 00:38:36,097; ;You want to keep those numbers in mind or refer to those if you have an SCv200 and you need to determine if the bandwidth considerations for...
317; ;00:38:36,097 --> 00:38:39,805; ;You know, that particular model because it does have SAS on the front end.
318; ;00:38:39,805 --> 00:38:46,759; ;Today it's the only one of the SC Series models that supports SAS out to servers.
319; ;00:38:48,582 --> 00:38:54,484; ;All right, let's look at some other considerations around designing front-end connections, okay?
320; ;00:38:54,484 --> 00:39:01,777; ;So again, you want to use DPACK or some other tool to analyze the customer's throughput between host and storage.
321; ;00:39:01,777 --> 00:39:09,770; ;Again, remember, keep in mind the network type, whether it's iSCSI, whether it's Fibre Channel, and what are those requirements.
322; ;00:39:09,770 --> 00:39:14,397; ;In other words, what speed of Fibre Channel is it? Is it 8 gig, is it 16 gig?
323; ;00:39:14,397 --> 00:39:21,325; ;Always remember to use the customer's peak throughput from those analysis tools, right?
324; ;00:39:21,325 --> 00:39:30,087; ;Design front-end requirements to have enough active ports to accommodate the customer's doubled bandwidth.
325; ;00:39:30,087 --> 00:39:35,444; ;That's what we say there, doubled is the customer's peak throughput when you're designing front-end ports.
326; ;00:39:35,444 --> 00:39:37,676; ;So why would you do that?
327; ;00:39:37,676 --> 00:39:42,835; ;All right, while you would do it in the scenario of a dual controller environment which again...
328; ;00:39:44,087 --> 00:39:54,604; ;80-85% of our customers have a dual controller environment, in that type of scenario, right, the controllers are active-active, meaning that they share the total front-end throughput.
329; ;00:39:54,604 --> 00:40:06,399; ;So if one of the controllers goes down, either for maintenance or there's some type of failure, the single remaining controller runs but it has to handle all of the front-end traffic.
330; ;00:40:06,399 --> 00:40:13,418; ;If one controller is down, does the customer expect to run smoothly on just the remaining controller?
331; ;00:40:13,418 --> 00:40:17,919; ;Right, if he does, the throughput number should be double.
332; ;00:40:17,919 --> 00:40:20,108; ;It's as simple as that, right?
333; ;00:40:20,108 --> 00:40:35,365; ;So if a customer only has one controller, if you're only sizing for one, maybe it's a DR site, maybe it's a very small implementation, yeah, then you wouldn't have to worry about this doubling of the front-end ports, okay?
334; ;00:40:35,365 --> 00:40:39,171; ;Another thing is determine if the front-end ports are going to be used for replication.
335; ;00:40:39,171 --> 00:40:45,017; ;So if they're doing replication, keep that in mind in terms of bandwidth, okay?
336; ;00:40:45,017 --> 00:40:53,931; ;Consider again the network type, again, most of our customers use iSCSI for replication, so how many ports are you going to have do you have for iSCSI?
337; ;00:40:53,931 --> 00:40:59,046; ;Do you have iSCSI to the host as well as for replication?
338; ;00:40:59,046 --> 00:41:04,673; ;Okay, so that's another thing to consider if you've got replication in the environment.
339; ;00:41:04,673 --> 00:41:17,823; ;One thing to keep in mind, it may be necessary to convert, depending on the tool, it may be necessary to convert kilobytes per second to megabytes per second to really get an accurate analysis if you've got the front-end sized properly.
340; ;00:41:19,512 --> 00:41:29,891; ;So let's look at an example of taking information from a tool and using it in coming up with a sizing consideration for the front-end.
341; ;00:41:29,891 --> 00:41:31,726; ;So here's a DPACK report.
342; ;00:41:31,726 --> 00:41:35,270; ;If you look at the DPACK report, there's a peak there of about...
343; ;00:41:35,270 --> 00:41:40,862; ;It's hard to tell exactly, but let's say about 1, 900 megabytes per second.
344; ;00:41:40,862 --> 00:41:46,697; ;Okay, so that's total, it's showing 1,900 reads, okay?
345; ;00:41:46,697 --> 00:41:52,195; ;So that's what about 2200, right, about 8 o'clock.
346; ;00:41:54,301 --> 00:42:09,926; ;Now that 1,900 megabytes per second, remember we're sizing to the peak for the front-end, so that 1,900 is sustainable by three 8 gig Fibre Channel FC ports or two 16 gig Fibre Channel FC ports, right?
347; ;00:42:09,926 --> 00:42:14,187; ;That means recommending a four port Fiber Channel card.
348; ;00:42:15,411 --> 00:42:17,153; ;Right? In the case of an 8 gig.
349; ;00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:24,236; ;Because the 16 gig Fiber Channel port cards are only dual port anyway, okay?
350; ;00:42:24,236 --> 00:42:36,682; ;So in either case, whether the customer has 8 gig Fibre Channel in their environment or if they've got 16 gig Fibre Channel I would recommend having a second card in the controller, right?
351; ;00:42:36,682 --> 00:42:49,981; ;Just for future expansion if nothing else, so that would mean you'd have two Fibre Channel cards Fibre Channel HBAs in both controllers, okay?
352; ;00:42:49,981 --> 00:42:56,176; ;Now another thing to keep in mind is the average IO size, you want to make sure that isn't getting abnormally large.
353; ;00:42:56,176 --> 00:42:57,998; ;So how do we figure that out?
354; ;00:42:57,998 --> 00:43:05,993; ;So average IO size can be determined by dividing the total IOPS into the megabytes per second, right?
355; ;00:43:05,993 --> 00:43:13,252; ;So if we look at, for example, the 6 o'clock timeframe which is a little more of an average time, we see about...
356; ;00:43:17,122 --> 00:43:21,479; ;The throughput is about 1,100 megabytes per second, okay?
357; ;00:43:21,479 --> 00:43:33,671; ;And this is going back to our example of 10,000 front-end IOPS, we don't see that on this chart, but 10,000 front-end IOPS throughput is about 1,100 megabytes.
358; ;00:43:33,671 --> 00:43:36,105; ;That's where the 1100 is coming from.
359; ;00:43:36,105 --> 00:43:37,935; ;Therefore... Oops.
360; ;00:43:39,806 --> 00:43:40,825; ;Sorry.
361; ;00:43:40,825 --> 00:43:53,627; ;Therefore, 1100 divided by 10,000 is 0.11 which is 11 kilobyte average block size that would be considered in the normal range.
362; ;00:43:53,627 --> 00:44:02,920; ;So what we're looking for there is if you're going well beyond that average block size, that could have a definite impact on front-end throughput.
363; ;00:44:05,184 --> 00:44:07,869; ;Let's take a look at a couple of review questions again.
364; ;00:44:08,882 --> 00:44:11,336; ;And we're going to go ahead and start with...
365; ;00:44:12,546 --> 00:44:17,528; ;A 10 gig iSCSI interface has about how much port bandwidth?
366; ;00:44:19,233 --> 00:44:21,512; ;We had that chart earlier. Yep.
367; ;00:44:21,512 --> 00:44:25,760; ;About 600 megabytes in a 10 gig interface.
368; ;00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:30,849; ;What is the recommended number of spares in an SC Series?
369; ;00:44:30,849 --> 00:44:31,968; ;And we talked about that.
370; ;00:44:33,668 --> 00:44:38,019; ;One spare per twenty-four drives of the same drive type.
371; ;00:44:39,538 --> 00:44:40,819; ;Okay, good.
372; ;00:44:40,819 --> 00:44:46,161; ;And then finally, what RAID types indicate dual redundancy is applied in a tier?
373; ;00:44:48,161 --> 00:44:49,957; ;A couple different ones, right?
374; ;00:44:49,957 --> 00:44:50,958; ;Yep.
375; ;00:44:50,958 --> 00:44:55,353; ;RAID 10 dual mirror and RAID 6.
376; ;00:44:55,353 --> 00:45:01,723; ;Remember that RAID 10 and RAID 5 are single redundancy.
377; ;00:45:01,723 --> 00:45:05,293; ;RAID 10 dual mirror, RAID 6 are dual redundancy.
378; ;00:45:07,168 --> 00:45:15,509; ;So the final sizing step in an SC Series is to determine the number of back-end connections.
379; ;00:45:17,626 --> 00:45:24,590; ;So we determined the number and type of the front-end, now it's time to determine the number of back-end connections.
380; ;00:45:24,590 --> 00:45:28,442; ;So when we talk about determining the number of back-end connections.
381; ;00:45:28,442 --> 00:45:43,213; ;One thing that makes it a little bit easier is the fact that when we're connecting to the back-end, and remember the back-end connectivity refers to the link between the storage center controllers and the disk enclosures, so that's a direct connection.
382; ;00:45:43,213 --> 00:45:50,957; ;It's just SAS connectivity, so there's no Fibre Channel, there's no iSCSI determining which is which.
383; ;00:45:50,957 --> 00:45:58,516; ;It's direct connect, so we're not going through a switch, it's direct connect on an SC9000 and an SC8000.
384; ;00:45:58,516 --> 00:46:03,632; ;We're directly connecting between the controllers and the enclosures.
385; ;00:46:03,632 --> 00:46:15,802; ;So our example here is this is two SC9000 controllers and we're directly connected to one, two, three, four enclosures, okay?
386; ;00:46:15,802 --> 00:46:24,858; ;And we've got two half-height SAS cards in each, those are the two SAS cards, one on the top, second one on the bottom.
387; ;00:46:24,858 --> 00:46:28,381; ;And then we're coming up with two chains based on how we're connecting them.
388; ;00:46:28,381 --> 00:46:34,231; ;So let's talk a little bit more about this SAS port technology that we're seeing here.
389; ;00:46:34,231 --> 00:46:41,022; ;One thing to be aware of, the one physical port actually contains four virtual ports.
390; ;00:46:41,022 --> 00:46:48,675; ;They're often referred to as lanes, but they are physically there and there are 12 gigs per lane.
391; ;00:46:48,675 --> 00:47:01,272; ;So you'll hear this term 12 gig SAS, but realistically, it's 48 gigs of available bandwidth if we're talking about the physical SAS port, okay?
392; ;00:47:04,207 --> 00:47:09,394; ;Now if you've got, as we know, there's a 2-port SAS card that we're seeing over here, right?
393; ;00:47:09,394 --> 00:47:19,319; ;One 2-port SAS card provides two SAS chains, you can have one chain on each port, 96 gigs of bandwidth, right.
394; ;00:47:19,319 --> 00:47:33,241; ;384 drives as of this release, SCOS 7.0, when we developed this material, 192 drives per SAS chain was the max, okay?
395; ;00:47:33,241 --> 00:47:39,270; ;So again, that limit could certainly increase as future releases of SCOS come out.
396; ;00:47:39,270 --> 00:47:40,804; ;So keep that in mind.
397; ;00:47:41,954 --> 00:47:47,483; ;Future growth is definitely possible as different releases of SCOS come out.
398; ;00:47:47,483 --> 00:47:54,707; ;Now when you're sizing the back-end on an SC9000, here are a couple of things to kind of consider.
399; ;00:47:54,707 --> 00:48:02,229; ;You want to double the front-end bandwidth and we'll give you a little example here of what that means, but you want to double what the front-end bandwidth is.
400; ;00:48:02,229 --> 00:48:09,806; ;When you do that doubling, you want to convert from megabytes per second to gigabits per second on the back-end.
401; ;00:48:09,806 --> 00:48:17,669; ;I'll kind of explain what that means, and then we'll kind of estimate the number of SAS chains needed based on that.
402; ;00:48:17,669 --> 00:48:30,441; ;So as an example here, if I've got 312 drives, so we did an analysis, we found 312 drives is what the customer needs.
403; ;00:48:30,441 --> 00:48:38,244; ;If we divide that by the maximum number of drives per chain, that's going to give us 1.6 chains.
404; ;00:48:38,244 --> 00:48:43,204; ;And of course, again, you can't 1.6 chains, so you round that up to two chains.
405; ;00:48:43,204 --> 00:48:52,161; ;So first of all, if you have a system with 312 drives, you would need 2 SAS chains at a minimum just to get all those drives on there.
406; ;00:48:52,161 --> 00:49:00,990; ;And certainly, it's a good idea to leave some room on the SAS chains, especially on a new installation, so you don't want to fill up all the drives anyway.
407; ;00:49:00,990 --> 00:49:09,333; ;You know, in our case here, so if we had 192 drives, even that you'd want to make it on 2 chains, okay?
408; ;00:49:09,333 --> 00:49:19,367; ;Now one thing to keep in mind as you're figuring out the number of chains, if you're familiar with the SC8000, we'll talk more specifically about the SC8000 next.
409; ;00:49:19,367 --> 00:49:31,146; ;But on the SC8000, you had a back-end interconnect, some of you may be familiar with, that back-end interconnect is no longer needed on the SC9000.
410; ;00:49:31,146 --> 00:49:43,763; ;And when we talk about the SC8000, we'll explain the purpose of that back-end interconnect when we get there, but that's something you don't need on the SC9000, okay?
411; ;00:49:43,763 --> 00:49:52,525; ;Now as we mentioned a moment ago, it's important to ensure that back-end bandwidth is double that amount of front-end bandwidth, okay?
412; ;00:49:52,525 --> 00:49:59,698; ;The reason for that is to allow for additional overhead incurred by RAID, right, when you're writing to the disk.
413; ;00:49:59,698 --> 00:50:05,510; ;Your performance needs would generally be met by a single SAS card in each controller, okay.
414; ;00:50:05,510 --> 00:50:10,777; ;But be certain that you meet this 2x bandwidth requirement that we're talking about, okay.
415; ;00:50:10,777 --> 00:50:22,908; ;So in our example of 312 drives, we said we needed to chains, but now it doesn't take into consideration IO traffic from the front-end ports, okay?
416; ;00:50:22,908 --> 00:50:28,256; ;Remember though, that traffic is flowing through the controllers and down to the drives.
417; ;00:50:28,256 --> 00:50:37,110; ;Okay, so to address that traffic from the front-end, we go back to the front-end throughput numbers that we've talked about a little earlier.
418; ;00:50:38,285 --> 00:50:47,072; ;So look at this example, assume our data gathering analysis showed 700 megabytes of front-end traffic, okay?
419; ;00:50:47,072 --> 00:50:52,919; ;So when sizing the front-end, remember that it should accommodate a minimum of 1400 megabytes, right?
420; ;00:50:52,919 --> 00:50:59,364; ;So then if a controller fails, it can fail to that second controller and everything will keep running fine.
421; ;00:50:59,364 --> 00:51:13,440; ;So in our example of 312 drives, remember we want double the throughput of 1,400 megabytes per second, so best practices would dictate a back-end configuration that looks like this.
422; ;00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:23,510; ;If the front-end bandwidth is 400 megabytes per second, right, then back-end bandwidth should be twice that or 2, 800 megabytes per second.
423; ;00:51:23,510 --> 00:51:36,201; ;And if you recall, we said we want to convert that to gigabits so that's going to be 22.4 gigabits per second that we're going to need keeping that front-end throughput in mind.
424; ;00:51:38,344 --> 00:51:39,734; ;Okay?
425; ;00:51:39,734 --> 00:51:46,832; ;So keep that in mind when you're designing your SAS back-end on an SC9000.
426; ;00:51:46,832 --> 00:51:51,082; ;So that's back-end connectivity for an SC9000.
427; ;00:51:51,082 --> 00:51:56,485; ;Let's look at back-end connectivity for the SC8000, okay?
428; ;00:51:56,485 --> 00:52:06,385; ;This is a picture here of an SC8000 and we're going to do very similar to what we did with the SC9000 and then we've got dual controller SC8000s and we've got four enclosures.
429; ;00:52:06,385 --> 00:52:10,913; ;We've got full height SAS cards here as opposed to the half-height we have on the SC9000.
430; ;00:52:10,913 --> 00:52:24,922; ;Notice, it might be little bit hard to tell, but there are actually four ports up here as opposed to two on the SC9000 and of course, the reason for that is SC8000 has 6 gig SAS.
431; ;00:52:24,922 --> 00:52:34,495; ;And just as we discussed a moment ago with the SC9000, there are four lanes and each lane is 6 gig per second, okay?
432; ;00:52:34,495 --> 00:52:43,559; ;So then we end up with the 24 gig throughput here, okay, because we've got 6 gig of SAS, right?
433; ;00:52:43,559 --> 00:52:53,455; ;Now, one 4-port SAS card provides two SAS chains, 96 gig of bandwidth, and again up to 384 drives.
434; ;00:52:53,455 --> 00:53:08,041; ;So just like we saw on the SC9000, potentially, we could go over that 192 max per chain down the line, but as of right now, as of version 7.0, that's the max that we're at.
435; ;00:53:08,041 --> 00:53:16,901; ;And as we talked about with the SC9000, same kind of rules apply in terms of making sure we don't saturate a chain adding another card to a second...
436; ;00:53:18,491 --> 00:53:23,693; ;To a second controller if you want to go that route, it'd be highly recommend it.
437; ;00:53:23,693 --> 00:53:35,803; ;Now one thing to keep in mind, we touched on this briefly on the SC9000, but plan on using one SAS chain on an SC8000 as an interconnect between the two controllers.
438; ;00:53:37,134 --> 00:53:42,063; ;Okay? There's only one back-end SAS chain being used for this, okay.
439; ;00:53:42,063 --> 00:53:47,476; ;So if there's only one, you have to make sure that you've got an interconnect set up.
440; ;00:53:47,476 --> 00:53:53,552; ;Okay, so what that does, it provides a high-speed link within the system for back-end functions.
441; ;00:53:53,552 --> 00:53:58,649; ;And as much as anything, it's for write-cache mirroring, okay?
442; ;00:53:58,649 --> 00:54:08,509; ;So if the system requires two or more back-end SAS chains for disk enclosures, you don't necessarily have to have that cross-connect SAS cable, okay?
443; ;00:54:08,509 --> 00:54:14,453; ;But it is something to kind of keep in mind especially if you have smaller systems, okay?
444; ;00:54:14,453 --> 00:54:28,523; ;And the same kind of considerations are here in terms of making sure that you have plenty of bandwidth, so you want to size that SAS back in, again, double the front-end bandwidth.
445; ;00:54:28,523 --> 00:54:34,119; ;When you're doing the calculation, remember you want to convert megabytes per second on the front-end and gigabits per second.
446; ;00:54:34,119 --> 00:54:42,096; ;Which is what it would be on the back-end and then give yourself an estimate of the number of SAS chains needed.
1; ;00:00:01,735 --> 00:00:14,273; ;So before we get into specific discussions about SSD, what do you think is a critical consideration when sizing an All Flash Array, often referred to as AFA?
2; ;00:00:14,273 --> 00:00:18,466; ;Yup, the amount of throughput generated by the SSDs.
3; ;00:00:19,556 --> 00:00:23,840; ;Okay, that's a big part of, when you look at an all-flash array.
4; ;00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:33,779; ;Right, so let's look at flash solutions and SSD design considerations in the SC Series.
5; ;00:00:33,779 --> 00:00:45,814; ;So let's start our discussion of design considerations in the SSD world by looking at the difference between SSDs and HDDs or spinning disks, okay?
6; ;00:00:45,814 --> 00:00:50,284; ;So we really want to understand how SSD drives differ from spinning drives.
7; ;00:00:50,284 --> 00:00:55,272; ;That's really critical to implementing a Storage Center design when using SSDs.
8; ;00:00:55,272 --> 00:00:58,020; ;It's a huge part of the solution.
9; ;00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:04,744; ;So couple things to remember, SSDs provide more IOPS than spinning disks.
10; ;00:01:04,744 --> 00:01:15,191; ;They do not scale throughput the way they scale IOPS, that's an important one that some people overlook when they are designing with SSDs.
11; ;00:01:15,191 --> 00:01:24,082; ;They have varying throughput depending on the application block size, talked about that earlier, that's a huge part of this, what is the application that's running?
12; ;00:01:24,082 --> 00:01:29,627; ;And we really introduce SSDs to minimize latency, okay?
13; ;00:01:29,627 --> 00:01:40,598; ;Now the main concern isn't really how many IOPS a drive can provide, as it is with HDDs, but how much throughput, given an average block size?
14; ;00:01:40,598 --> 00:01:57,994; ;So when you're designing a flash solution, you still need to provide the required IOPS but since data can move to another tier depending on the configuration, you can consider the IOPS of both tier 1 and tier 2 when determining the number of drives to be used.
15; ;00:01:57,994 --> 00:02:09,052; ;Of course that makes the calculation a little more complex since you are starting with the block size and determining IOPS from the maximum throughput of the SSD drive.
16; ;00:02:09,052 --> 00:02:18,638; ;All right, with flash optimized you also need to consider how many reads are happening from tier 1 before data progression moves the data to tier 2.
17; ;00:02:18,638 --> 00:02:27,154; ;Now this is not the case in a single tier solution where the SSD drives are all the same type, okay?
18; ;00:02:27,154 --> 00:02:42,639; ;So again, what you are seeing more and more of now because of the size of the SSD drives are increasing, the lower cost of these SSD drives, the industry is seeing more and more all-flash solutions, okay?
19; ;00:02:42,639 --> 00:02:45,095; ;And here at Dell, we are no exception.
20; ;00:02:45,095 --> 00:02:57,835; ;In the second half of 2015, in fact, there were about the same number of all-flash arrays sold as there were Dell's flash-optimized solution.
21; ;00:02:59,403 --> 00:03:09,105; ;So let's kind of do a quick review of the flash solution not only in the SC Series but also in general, okay?
22; ;00:03:09,105 --> 00:03:15,987; ;So using SSDs in the SC Series allows for a large increase in system IOPS, right?
23; ;00:03:15,987 --> 00:03:20,346; ;Reduced latencies and higher storage densities.
24; ;00:03:20,346 --> 00:03:27,854; ;And this is especially true as SSDs actually become larger than the spinning disks, okay?
25; ;00:03:27,854 --> 00:03:35,974; ;The beauty of the Dell solution with SSD is you can afford to put all your workloads on flash, okay?
26; ;00:03:35,974 --> 00:03:41,323; ;Turbocharging application performance without breaking the IT budget, okay?
27; ;00:03:41,323 --> 00:03:46,452; ;So let's look at a couple of flash solutions that are available, right?
28; ;00:03:46,452 --> 00:03:49,003; ;One is a single tier flash.
29; ;00:03:49,003 --> 00:04:00,606; ;Okay, now a single tier flash can support either write-intensive, WI, and read-intensive, RI, SSD drives.
30; ;00:04:00,606 --> 00:04:07,489; ;Now just be aware that both of these can't exist in the same tier, okay?
31; ;00:04:07,489 --> 00:04:19,921; ;So if you did have them both, writes would go into tier 1, write-intensive SSDs in RAID10, when a snapshot's taken, data is converted to RAID5 or RAID6 on that same tier of drives, okay?
32; ;00:04:19,921 --> 00:04:29,461; ;So when you convert from RAID10 to RAID5 and RAID6, it allows for better performance and much greater efficiency, okay?
33; ;00:04:29,461 --> 00:04:34,878; ;Now you can certainly on a single tier of flash, you could have all read-intensive, right?
34; ;00:04:34,878 --> 00:04:43,903; ;If they are all read-intensive, it would all be convertible from RAID10 to RAID5 and RAID6 on that single tier of flash, okay?
35; ;00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:53,550; ;Then the other solution, this is actually the original flash solution was a flash optimized solution, and that's defined as using two tiers of flash.
36; ;00:04:53,550 --> 00:05:08,907; ;So writes go into tier 1, which would be the specific write-intensive SSDs in RAID10, then when a snapshot's taken, data is moved into tier 2 which are the read-intensive SSDs, okay?
37; ;00:05:08,907 --> 00:05:17,192; ;So the easiest way to think of the two, between single tier of flash and flash optimized is that if you've got more than one type of SSD drives.
38; ;00:05:17,192 --> 00:05:23,644; ;So if you've got write-intensive and read-intensive, that's going to be a flash optimized solution.
39; ;00:05:23,644 --> 00:05:28,946; ;If you've got one type of SSD, that's going to be an all-flash array, okay?
40; ;00:05:28,946 --> 00:05:38,719; ;It's going to be either write-intensive or read-intensive but it's gonna be a single tier of flash, and that makes it not flash optimized.
41; ;00:05:40,664 --> 00:05:50,480; ;Okay, so let's continue on with our flash solution review, and here we're gonna look at the movement of data between tiers, okay?
42; ;00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:56,503; ;And this is done by something that we refer to as on-demand data progression.
43; ;00:05:56,503 --> 00:06:03,399; ;Now on-demand data progression works specifically with the flash optimized solution.
44; ;00:06:03,399 --> 00:06:18,702; ;And what it does, it makes it possible to move data from the tier 1 drives to more cost-effective tier 2 drives which are going to be the read-intensive SSDs after every snapshot is taken, okay?
45; ;00:06:18,702 --> 00:06:27,176; ;Now it allows for data to continuously move out of tier 1 'cause again if you have the write-intensive SSDs, they're more expensive, okay?
46; ;00:06:27,176 --> 00:06:31,122; ;So we want to free up that space, that's what on-demand data progression does.
47; ;00:06:31,122 --> 00:06:37,709; ;And it provides SSD read performance for those read-intensive drives that are in tier 2.
48; ;00:06:39,408 --> 00:06:48,059; ;Okay, now from a flash usage standpoint, realistically today, most customers only need a single tier of flash.
49; ;00:06:48,059 --> 00:07:00,326; ;As that single tier is going to provide very high performance and it's also at the same time going to help to lower the cost of an all-flash array as well as a hybrid solution, okay?
50; ;00:07:00,326 --> 00:07:09,828; ;As we said flash optimized is also an option that can help lower the cost and keep high endurance levels for those flash drives.
51; ;00:07:11,602 --> 00:07:17,174; ;So let's look at some single tier design considerations with SSDs, right?
52; ;00:07:17,174 --> 00:07:22,472; ;So let's kinda look at these all-flash array considerations, right?
53; ;00:07:22,472 --> 00:07:23,725; ;'Cause that's typically what...
54; ;00:07:23,725 --> 00:07:28,324; ;When we talk about a single tier design, we're talking about an all-flash array, okay?
55; ;00:07:28,324 --> 00:07:36,669; ;So you want to make sure you size to provide the required IOPS, just like you would with any HDD or spinning disk system.
56; ;00:07:36,669 --> 00:07:44,637; ;And use the Storage Center sizing calculator rather than complex manual calculators of block size, IOPS, and throughput.
57; ;00:07:44,637 --> 00:07:50,369; ;And we're gonna talk about where that calculator is coming up in a couple of slides.
58; ;00:07:50,369 --> 00:07:56,990; ;Here's some other things to kind of keep in mind when you start designing all-flash.
59; ;00:07:56,990 --> 00:08:02,521; ;Drives may have to be added with little regard to drive size when you're looking for IOPS here.
60; ;00:08:02,521 --> 00:08:07,218; ;So when adding new drives, use the minimum number of drives to meet the IO requirements.
61; ;00:08:07,218 --> 00:08:11,968; ;Again, you're looking at from a cost standpoint here as much as anything.
62; ;00:08:11,968 --> 00:08:16,941; ;Follow the dual redundancy recommendations and requirements that we talked about earlier.
63; ;00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:25,384; ;Now one thing to keep in mind is this adding 0.7 percent capacity for dedupe metadata.
64; ;00:08:25,384 --> 00:08:28,140; ;So especially when you're sizing large systems.
65; ;00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:31,165; ;So we haven't talked a lot about that but that's one thing to keep in mind.
66; ;00:08:31,165 --> 00:08:36,162; ;And again the calculator will take that into account.
67; ;00:08:36,162 --> 00:08:39,107; ;Avoid taking frequent snapshots, all right?
68; ;00:08:39,107 --> 00:08:45,712; ;So, for example, don't schedule snapshots to run every minute or even every five minutes, okay?
69; ;00:08:45,712 --> 00:08:53,165; ;That's a critical piece that you don't want too many snapshots filling up those SSD drives, okay?
70; ;00:08:53,165 --> 00:08:59,574; ;So you want to get that acceptable RPO and go from there.
71; ;00:08:59,574 --> 00:09:04,289; ;Write cache is disabled by default, this will actually improve your throughput.
72; ;00:09:04,289 --> 00:09:10,973; ;And write-intensive and read-intensive drives, keep in mind, they can't exist within the same tier.
73; ;00:09:10,973 --> 00:09:20,778; ;So if you have write-intensive and read-intensive drives, that is no longer going to be a single tier solution, that's going to be a flash-optimized solution.
74; ;00:09:22,924 --> 00:09:30,498; ;Let's review some SSD performance characteristics, some of the stuff we've talked about earlier but just to kind of reinforce it.
75; ;00:09:30,498 --> 00:09:36,918; ;There are some things that need to be taken into consideration when you are designing a system with SSD drives, right?
76; ;00:09:38,487 --> 00:09:45,118; ;SSDs provide significantly more IOPS than spinning drives, as we've talked about, and greatly reduces latency.
77; ;00:09:45,118 --> 00:09:49,161; ;It can really have two to three times the throughput of spinning drives.
78; ;00:09:49,161 --> 00:09:54,361; ;Hence, obviously that's why they are becoming more and more popular.
79; ;00:09:54,361 --> 00:10:01,263; ;Designing with spinning drives you need to be concerned with having enough of them to provide the needed IOPS.
80; ;00:10:01,263 --> 00:10:07,389; ;Now with SSD drives, the concern is providing enough throughput and capacity.
81; ;00:10:07,389 --> 00:10:10,024; ;So those are, you know, obviously two different things.
82; ;00:10:10,024 --> 00:10:15,603; ;So you really need to keep that in mind when you are designing for the SSDs, that is different.
83; ;00:10:15,603 --> 00:10:22,027; ;You want to use the Storage Center design sizing calculator for optimal sizing.
84; ;00:10:22,027 --> 00:10:28,537; ;We are going to talk more about the calculator in the next few slides.
1; ;00:00:01,243 --> 00:00:08,019; ;So let's look at the SC sizing tool and then some other available resources that we can use along with the tool.
2; ;00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:20,298; ;An update to the SC sizing tool was released with the release of a SCOS 7.0 and you can see the version there, it's SC calculator 1.2.
3; ;00:00:20,298 --> 00:00:26,339; ;So it was a considerable upgrade from the sizing tool we had previously.
4; ;00:00:26,339 --> 00:00:37,480; ;And this is where all of the sizing information that the sizing calculators are going to be going forward as far as where they are in the network and we'll show you that in a minute.
5; ;00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:52,422; ;So the SC Series sizing calculator 1.2 is for the SC9000, SC8000, SC7020, and SC4020 and we'll see it soon for the SCv2000.
6; ;00:00:52,422 --> 00:00:56,154; ;So we're going to continue to upgrade it as we move forward.
7; ;00:00:57,238 --> 00:01:12,572; ;The SC calculator 1.2, the sizing is based on either all-flash or all-spinning or a combination of flash and spinning disks, you have the choice when you fill out the calculator.
8; ;00:01:12,572 --> 00:01:21,854; ;You input data from DPACK, you may have another source certainly as well, but DPACK is the one we would recommend as far as filling out the calculator.
9; ;00:01:21,854 --> 00:01:26,114; ;Adjust disk type and capacity to meet the design requirement.
10; ;00:01:27,778 --> 00:01:34,216; ;And the beauty of it of course is that the sizing calculations are built in to the calculator.
11; ;00:01:34,216 --> 00:01:44,299; ;So some of the things that we've been talking about, it's good to have an understanding of how that works, but certainly it's nicer to be able to plug the numbers into a calculator and have it come back.
12; ;00:01:44,299 --> 00:01:46,806; ;So this is what the calculator looks like.
13; ;00:01:46,806 --> 00:01:55,040; ;And the next slide, we'll dig a little bit deeper into some of the fields and some of the choices but this is what the calculator looks like.
14; ;00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:58,852; ;Down here, this is where it can be found, okay?
15; ;00:01:58,852 --> 00:02:16,363; ;So basically, it's kind of tied to the DPACK 2, so dpack2.dell.com/tools/sccalculator that is the location and it's accessible from the outside, so it's not just for Dell folks, it's also for partners.
16; ;00:02:16,363 --> 00:02:21,458; ;So as long as you have a login to the DPACK site, you can access the calculator.
17; ;00:02:23,483 --> 00:02:30,568; ;Now the other thing that is available on that same site is a Design Guide, okay?
18; ;00:02:30,568 --> 00:02:36,463; ;So that's what you click on here, the View Design Guide to access the design guide itself, okay?
19; ;00:02:36,463 --> 00:02:40,728; ;So SC Series Array design and Scalability Guide, okay?
20; ;00:02:40,728 --> 00:02:42,600; ;And again, this is updated.
21; ;00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:47,553; ;It was updated as you can see this particular version is July 2016.
22; ;00:02:47,553 --> 00:03:02,778; ;But really what it is it's a technical white paper that contains design philosophies, recommendations, sizing calculations, spinning sizing considerations and examples, and SSD drive spinning...
23; ;00:03:02,778 --> 00:03:07,051; ;Excuse me, SSD drive sizing consideration's an example, okay?
24; ;00:03:07,051 --> 00:03:11,893; ;So there's a lot of great information here in the design and scalability guide.
25; ;00:03:11,893 --> 00:03:14,941; ;It's an excellent supplement to this course as a matter of fact.
26; ;00:03:14,941 --> 00:03:19,952; ;It's really recommended to take a look at the guide before using the calculator.
27; ;00:03:19,952 --> 00:03:24,890; ;It really helps improve how you use the calculator.
28; ;00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:31,292; ;Here's what the calculator looks like, gives you a bigger picture than we saw on the last slide.
29; ;00:03:31,292 --> 00:03:39,289; ;So what you'll do is you follow the steps of the outline in this course and you'll input your customer's data into the SC calculator, okay?
30; ;00:03:39,289 --> 00:03:46,940; ;Now the tool's output provides suggested configurations modeled on the data that you've provided.
31; ;00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:53,462; ;Now you can adjust the configurations certainly if you need to and most likely you'll need to fine tune your design.
32; ;00:03:53,462 --> 00:03:57,000; ;But let's just take a look at some of the options that you can set up here.
33; ;00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:07,991; ;So first of all, you have the system selection, so we mentioned the four different systems, the SC4020, SC7020, SC8000, and SC9000, you can select any of those.
34; ;00:04:07,991 --> 00:04:13,210; ;You have the capacity and again, here's where you're getting a lot of those numbers from DPACK.
35; ;00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:16,569; ;What's the capacity that the customer requires?
36; ;00:04:16,569 --> 00:04:17,884; ;What kind of IOPS?
37; ;00:04:17,884 --> 00:04:22,343; ;Okay, again, that's going to come from the, typically, DPACK.
38; ;00:04:22,343 --> 00:04:24,911; ;What's the average IO size?
39; ;00:04:24,911 --> 00:04:27,889; ;What percentage of read/write does the customer have?
40; ;00:04:27,889 --> 00:04:36,453; ;So again, that's all going to be coming from the DPACK report, okay?
41; ;00:04:36,453 --> 00:04:39,239; ;Are you going to have deduplication or compression?
42; ;00:04:39,239 --> 00:04:43,235; ;Okay, that certainly is going to come into play here, okay?
43; ;00:04:43,235 --> 00:04:46,498; ;And notice, there's a Workload Selector down here.
44; ;00:04:46,498 --> 00:04:49,287; ;So what kind of workload do you have?
45; ;00:04:49,287 --> 00:04:52,198; ;Do you have more virtual desktops?
46; ;00:04:52,198 --> 00:04:54,342; ;Okay, how much VM do you have?
47; ;00:04:54,342 --> 00:04:56,858; ;File share, SQL, et cetera, right?
48; ;00:04:56,858 --> 00:05:05,228; ;So you fill all that in just based on really what the customer's environment is, okay?
49; ;00:05:05,228 --> 00:05:10,977; ;And then you're going to have some of the outputs from the calculator and we'll look at these coming up here.
50; ;00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:20,894; ;You get Tier 1, there's peak values for Tier 1, IOPS, there's an estimated performance for Tier 1.
51; ;00:05:20,894 --> 00:05:25,344; ;And then as well Tier 3 results are down here, okay?
52; ;00:05:25,344 --> 00:05:30,787; ;So there's a lot of details that you get right on the screen one of the calculator.
53; ;00:05:30,787 --> 00:05:43,755; ;When you first get into the calculator, you'll have to acknowledge the disclaimer and, basically, it's just saying is going to help estimate size and analyze the capacity and IOPS.
54; ;00:05:43,755 --> 00:05:53,060; ;But certainly, not a guarantee that the storage array will meet the actual design, so that's really what the disclaimer is all about, okay?
55; ;00:05:53,060 --> 00:06:07,059; ;So once you check that that you acknowledge the disclaimer, it's probably a good idea to uncollapse the left hand margin here 'cause the beauty of it is you see everything that you get inside the calculator.
56; ;00:06:07,059 --> 00:06:14,481; ;So first, this is a Dashboard, Request DPACK Capture, you can actually do that right from the calculator.
57; ;00:06:14,481 --> 00:06:17,545; ;Projects, that you're currently perhaps working on.
58; ;00:06:17,545 --> 00:06:20,282; ;Collector Runs of DPACK.
59; ;00:06:20,282 --> 00:06:24,707; ;There's User Management and then the different tools, okay?
60; ;00:06:24,707 --> 00:06:27,123; ;There's a FluidFS Sizing Tool.
61; ;00:06:27,123 --> 00:06:33,917; ;We're going to obviously, we're going to focus on the SC calculator but you can see everything that you've got right here.
62; ;00:06:33,917 --> 00:06:42,217; ;So it's a really good idea to uncollapse that and see all of your choices there in the right margin, okay?
63; ;00:06:42,217 --> 00:06:47,291; ;So again, there are our options up here, our different systems that we can select.
64; ;00:06:47,291 --> 00:06:51,501; ;This is an example of how this was filled in, right?
65; ;00:06:51,501 --> 00:06:54,172; ;So we have the IOPS again coming from DPACK.
66; ;00:06:54,172 --> 00:06:57,630; ;How much capacity is the customer looking for?
67; ;00:06:57,630 --> 00:07:01,193; ;The average IO size, what's the read/write percent?
68; ;00:07:01,193 --> 00:07:03,669; ;And again we're doing...
69; ;00:07:03,669 --> 00:07:06,864; ;We want to have it calculate deduplication.
70; ;00:07:06,864 --> 00:07:09,408; ;Here is the workloads.
71; ;00:07:09,408 --> 00:07:13,867; ;Again, that we put in for the customer, this ends up equaling 100, of course.
72; ;00:07:13,867 --> 00:07:17,565; ;We see the Tier 1 results and the Tier 3 results.
73; ;00:07:17,565 --> 00:07:23,091; ;So you click on Calculate and it'll come up with that, you know, information for us.
74; ;00:07:23,091 --> 00:07:31,733; ;Now there are if you click on the Assumptions tab, you'll see some of the assumptions that the calculator uses.
75; ;00:07:31,733 --> 00:07:39,252; ;So it's almost like an FAQ if you've got some questions on how did it come up with the values that it did, okay?
76; ;00:07:39,252 --> 00:07:49,366; ;And then you can see this really gives you RAID tiering is assumed for a single tier solution, Data Progression is assumed for a two tier solution.
77; ;00:07:49,366 --> 00:07:53,303; ;Notice, that it is focused on two tiers, okay?
78; ;00:07:53,303 --> 00:07:58,635; ;And again, that's because a majority of our customers use the two-tier approach, okay?
79; ;00:07:58,635 --> 00:08:05,188; ;So that's why the calculator was designed as two tiers, at least in the initial release, okay?
80; ;00:08:05,188 --> 00:08:07,298; ;So here are all different assumptions.
81; ;00:08:07,298 --> 00:08:10,580; ;So just click on Assumptions to see that.
82; ;00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:18,730; ;Now when you click on the Create Report box, the Create Report tab, you get a report, okay?
83; ;00:08:18,730 --> 00:08:23,404; ;And this is the Storage Center sizing tool results based on the input we put in.
84; ;00:08:23,404 --> 00:08:31,642; ;So you see Design Requirements, Tier 1 Configuration, Tier 3 Configuration, and here are your totals, okay?
85; ;00:08:31,642 --> 00:08:36,750; ;And this can be created, saved as a PDF as well.
86; ;00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:43,778; ;So it can be, you know, used really however you need it to.
87; ;00:08:43,778 --> 00:08:51,935; ;So it could be saved as a PDF and it can be sent to a manager or a director or that type of thing.
88; ;00:08:51,935 --> 00:09:09,184; ;When we talk about other tools that are available besides the SC calculator and DPACK, Dell TechCenter is really a very valuable resource, it's got a lot of great information, so I want to call your attention to what's out there on Dell TechCenter and how you can access it.
89; ;00:09:09,184 --> 00:09:16,665; ;So when you get out to the Dell TechCenter, this is the screen that shows up, it's like the storage home screen, okay?
90; ;00:09:16,665 --> 00:09:30,149; ;So, you can see all of the information that you have access to just from this site, so here's the link there to the site, right, just as the sizing calculator was.
91; ;00:09:30,149 --> 00:09:34,532; ;It's available for partners and Dell sales as well, right?
92; ;00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:42,930; ;So notice under Storage, just wanted to call your attention to that from the home page, you see all of the information you can get, lot of that is over here.
93; ;00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:47,224; ;But software-defined storage, FluidFS is all underneath here.
94; ;00:09:47,224 --> 00:09:53,102; ;Power vault is here, so it's all of Dell Storage, PS Series, okay?
95; ;00:09:53,102 --> 00:09:58,725; ;The Storage Networking, Storage Solutions Technical Documents is extremely valuable.
96; ;00:09:58,725 --> 00:10:02,582; ;And of course, the Dell Storage SC Series is under here as well.
97; ;00:10:02,582 --> 00:10:16,909; ;So this is all the information that you can get out of here too among other things, but I have technical white papers, video solutions, compatibility matrix, technical forums, technical wikis, and product spec sheets.
98; ;00:10:16,909 --> 00:10:26,782; ;So it's just almost unlimited the amount of information that you can get from here and it's constantly being updated, that's the beauty of this site.
99; ;00:10:26,782 --> 00:10:30,658; ;Our technical folks are constantly updating this site.
100; ;00:10:30,658 --> 00:10:32,476; ;So that's the Storage home.
101; ;00:10:32,476 --> 00:10:36,160; ;And then you have an option or a tab referred to as Forums.
102; ;00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:40,724; ;And this is what when you highlight forums, this is a screen that looks like, right?
103; ;00:10:40,724 --> 00:10:50,965; ;So what you're really looking at there with forums, a place to ask questions, a place to answer questions, right, to help others, join the conversation basically, right?
104; ;00:10:50,965 --> 00:10:55,379; ;Okay, so you can see here Dell Storage API, 38 posts, okay?
105; ;00:10:55,379 --> 00:10:57,771; ;Here's the most recent posts, right?
106; ;00:10:57,771 --> 00:11:00,871; ;So there's a lot of great threads in here.
107; ;00:11:00,871 --> 00:11:05,026; ;If you're looking for answers, this is very often a great place to start.
108; ;00:11:06,896 --> 00:11:10,198; ;And the last one there, from here is called Wikis.
109; ;00:11:10,198 --> 00:11:16,538; ;A lot of information just sort of from the experts, right?
110; ;00:11:16,538 --> 00:11:26,053; ;So Support Matrix, Dell Storage with Microsoft Storage Spaces Support Matrix, Introduction, Server boot drives, Switches.
111; ;00:11:26,053 --> 00:11:32,950; ;One of the things that I would say about this site is it's very much driven from a technical point of view, right?
112; ;00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:36,315; ;It's not a marketing page, right?
113; ;00:11:36,315 --> 00:11:44,119; ;It's devoted really as much as anything to technical solutions for technical folks in the field, right?
114; ;00:11:44,119 --> 00:11:58,096; ;And not only is it updated by the technical folks as it says there, this page is frequently updated collection of all SC Series, technical documents, and videos produced by Dell Storage engineering, marketing, et cetera, okay?
115; ;00:11:58,096 --> 00:12:05,750; ;Other things that are on this site besides here, it houses application specific data points, right?
116; ;00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:17,295; ;So if you are looking for information on data protection or databases, right, SQL Server, Microsoft Exchange, Oracle, okay?
117; ;00:12:17,295 --> 00:12:20,599; ;Also, we've seen details on FluidFS.
118; ;00:12:20,599 --> 00:12:33,856; ;So here's the website that you want to go to and potentially send your partners to or even customers, right, to access specific technical information about the SC Series.
1; ;00:00:00,668 --> 00:00:07,865; ;All right, in this section, we're going to cover the Native SANCopy Import feature of data mobility.
2; ;00:00:07,865 --> 00:00:13,400; ;We'll cover its overview, architecture, and capabilities.
3; ;00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:15,487; ;We'll start with the overview.
4; ;00:00:15,487 --> 00:00:25,160; ;Native SANCopy Import is a feature which imports block storage resources on to Unity from a VNX.
5; ;00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:31,372; ;That import operation is controlled manually on the Unity system.
6; ;00:00:31,372 --> 00:00:38,805; ;And basically, it utilizes SANCopy on the VNX.
7; ;00:00:38,805 --> 00:00:52,163; ;And the import feature sends a command to the VNX to issue a SANCopy push from the VNX to the Unity.
8; ;00:00:52,163 --> 00:00:58,522; ;It supports SANCopy connectivity over Fibre Channel or iSCSI.
9; ;00:00:58,522 --> 00:01:02,953; ;It imports LUNs and consistency groups.
10; ;00:01:02,953 --> 00:01:09,190; ;LUNs can be either classic thick or thin LUNs.
11; ;00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:17,549; ;The use case for the feature is simply for replacing VNX1 and VNX2 systems with Unity.
12; ;00:01:17,549 --> 00:01:26,993; ;This is a solution for migrating the block resources off from your Unity system.
13; ;00:01:26,993 --> 00:01:38,495; ;And the benefit of this feature is that the user doesn't really have to know anything about VNX administration or SANCopy administration.
14; ;00:01:38,495 --> 00:01:45,061; ;A lot of those nuances are taken care of within the Import feature itself.
15; ;00:01:47,653 --> 00:01:56,813; ;This slide details the attributes that are imported from the source VNX onto Unity.
16; ;00:01:56,813 --> 00:02:02,889; ;And as you can see, not all of the attributes are imported.
17; ;00:02:02,889 --> 00:02:08,678; ;Also, just some things aren't supported from VNX to Unity.
18; ;00:02:08,678 --> 00:02:16,775; ;For example, a classic LUN on VNX, although it can be imported, it will not be a classic LUN on Unity.
19; ;00:02:16,775 --> 00:02:21,105; ;It has no concept of a classic LUN.
20; ;00:02:23,968 --> 00:02:29,130; ;Now let's talk about the process and what happens.
21; ;00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:35,424; ;The very first thing in the process, so it's really before you would start an import at all.
22; ;00:02:35,424 --> 00:02:44,253; ;These are preconfigurations, things, or steps that need to be in place before an import session can proceed.
23; ;00:02:44,253 --> 00:02:56,424; ;So you need to configure SANCopy between the two systems, you need to establish a SANCopy connectivity.
24; ;00:02:56,424 --> 00:03:04,227; ;And for the host, that's going to access the LUN once it's migrated over to Unity.
25; ;00:03:04,227 --> 00:03:11,042; ;You'll need to make sure that host has connectivity and is registered on Unity.
26; ;00:03:11,042 --> 00:03:16,397; ;So with that all in place, then you can create an import connection.
27; ;00:03:16,397 --> 00:03:20,598; ;And that connection will establish the communications between the two systems.
28; ;00:03:20,598 --> 00:03:29,455; ;And the Unity system, the feature will discover the block resources that could be imported by the feature.
29; ;00:03:29,455 --> 00:03:32,178; ;Next, an import session is created.
30; ;00:03:32,178 --> 00:03:39,167; ;You would then choose the block resource that you would want to import.
31; ;00:03:39,167 --> 00:03:51,339; ;And an initial copy then is established and it creates the target object and puts the attributes on that object.
32; ;00:03:51,339 --> 00:03:55,752; ;Then incremental data copy begins.
33; ;00:03:55,752 --> 00:04:03,863; ;And this all goes on with that host connected to that storage resource on VNX.
34; ;00:04:03,863 --> 00:04:12,323; ;This migration doesn't affect the host at all, its access to the data in any fashion.
35; ;00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:31,308; ;To continue after the incremental copy, then differential copies are ongoing to keep up-to-date with changes that that host might be making to that source storage resource.
36; ;00:04:31,308 --> 00:04:44,410; ;After some point, a threshold is reached, a cutover threshold, which then the session can be cut over once that threshold is reached.
37; ;00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:49,546; ;A cutover is disruptive to the host.
38; ;00:04:49,546 --> 00:04:59,135; ;The tool will actually take the host out of the storage group on the VNX so that that host no longer has access to the LUN.
39; ;00:04:59,135 --> 00:05:07,653; ;And a final differential copy will synchronize the two, the source and target objects.
40; ;00:05:07,653 --> 00:05:19,942; ;And after that synchronization takes place, the host then accesses the target for production.
41; ;00:05:19,942 --> 00:05:24,222; ;And the session then completes.
42; ;00:05:24,222 --> 00:05:31,523; ;And the LUN on the VNX can be retired as a separate task from the import.
43; ;00:05:34,705 --> 00:05:36,836; ;Let's talk about feature management.
44; ;00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:45,436; ;The features management are managed via any of the interfaces, Unisphere, UEMCLI, and REST API.
45; ;00:05:45,436 --> 00:05:53,052; ;From Unisphere, it's managed in the protection and mobility section for interfaces and import.
46; ;00:05:53,052 --> 00:06:05,814; ;UEMCLI has a remote/sys/ command set which will establish communications and a session block to establish sessions, and the operations for the sessions.
47; ;00:06:05,814 --> 00:06:15,976; ;Rest API has something similar, remoteSystem to establish connectivity, importSession to create the session and the operations.
48; ;00:06:19,492 --> 00:06:21,963; ;Source VNX requirements.
49; ;00:06:21,963 --> 00:06:28,646; ;The VNX must be a block only or Unified VNX Unified system.
50; ;00:06:28,646 --> 00:06:34,557; ;It can be any VNX1 or VNX2 running any of those OE versions.
51; ;00:06:34,557 --> 00:06:37,537; ;SANCopy must be enabled.
52; ;00:06:37,537 --> 00:06:50,981; ;If the feature isn't enabled or installed on the system, you can get it from the VNX Installation Toolbox from the support site at no cost.
53; ;00:06:50,981 --> 00:06:58,559; ;SANCopy connectivity to Unity, you need to have Fibre Channel or iSCSI connectivity.
54; ;00:06:58,559 --> 00:07:13,700; ;Using the SANCopy ports, you know, you would want to avoid any mirror view ports or any synchronous Fibre Channel ports on Unity.
55; ;00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:19,554; ;On the VNX, you'd also need to configure the reserved LUN pool LUNs for SANCopy.
56; ;00:07:19,554 --> 00:07:26,290; ;And we need one RLP LUN per source LUN, and it should be about 20% the size of the source.
57; ;00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:33,414; ;Some considerations when using the Import feature.
58; ;00:07:33,414 --> 00:07:42,608; ;Anything on VNX that is deduplicated or compressed, that data will be rehydrated before being transmitted to Unity.
59; ;00:07:42,608 --> 00:07:47,235; ;So Unity doesn't support the deduplication or compressed data.
60; ;00:07:47,235 --> 00:07:50,648; ;So it must be rehydrated before being migrated.
61; ;00:07:50,648 --> 00:08:01,610; ;Active import sessions don't support a variety of things, LUN expansion on either the source or the target, host access on the target.
62; ;00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:12,041; ;The only entity that will have access to that LUN is the SANCopy host on the VNX.
63; ;00:08:12,041 --> 00:08:20,634; ;You can't have replication on the target or any snaps or snapshot schedules on the target.
64; ;00:08:20,634 --> 00:08:27,755; ;You can't add or remove LUNs to or from a consistency group on either the source or the target.
65; ;00:08:27,755 --> 00:08:35,582; ;And you wouldn't want to be performing any nondisruptive upgrades on either the source or the target during the import.
66; ;00:08:38,355 --> 00:08:40,333; ;Some more considerations.
67; ;00:08:40,333 --> 00:08:44,620; ;A five-second time synchronization is required between the two systems.
68; ;00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:51,379; ;So a common NTP configuration is recommended.
69; ;00:08:51,379 --> 00:08:58,529; ;If a storage processor on the Unity system is rebooted, the session will failover to the peer.
70; ;00:08:58,529 --> 00:09:07,968; ;If the whole Unity system is rebooted, the session is paused and will resume after the reboot is complete.
71; ;00:09:10,061 --> 00:09:14,154; ;And here are some Native SANCopy Import capabilities.
72; ;00:09:14,154 --> 00:09:19,293; ;And these are really the number of SANCopy sessions that can go on.
73; ;00:09:19,293 --> 00:09:23,754; ;And this is not a limit for Unity.
74; ;00:09:23,754 --> 00:09:29,095; ;It's simply the SANCopy sessions that VNX models support.
75; ;00:09:31,688 --> 00:09:41,963; ;And that completes the overview, architecture, and capabilities of the data mobility features, Native SANCopy.
1; ;00:00:00,609 --> 00:00:09,486; ;All right, now to continue the Data Mobility training, this section covers the Local LUN Move overview, architecture, and capabilities.
2; ;00:00:10,658 --> 00:00:29,656; ;For the overview of the feature, the Local LUN Move feature really just moves LUNs within a Unity system either between pools, you can go from one pool to another, and those pools can be different designs.
3; ;00:00:29,656 --> 00:00:33,422; ;SAS pool to NL-SAS pool, different RAID groups.
4; ;00:00:33,422 --> 00:00:39,034; ;Or you can move a LUN within a pool if it's in a flash pool.
5; ;00:00:39,034 --> 00:00:45,848; ;So the use cases for this are if you're moving it between pools, you might want to perform load balancing.
6; ;00:00:45,848 --> 00:00:54,527; ;If one pool is overworked, you might move a LUN to an underutilized pool.
7; ;00:00:54,527 --> 00:00:56,785; ;You might want to change the storage characteristics.
8; ;00:00:56,785 --> 00:01:06,072; ;You might want to move the LUN from a high-performance disk to an archival disk, maybe a SAS pool to an NL-SAS pool.
9; ;00:01:07,094 --> 00:01:10,473; ;The other use case is to enable inline compression.
10; ;00:01:10,473 --> 00:01:18,225; ;And that's when you would move an existing LUN within a flash pool.
11; ;00:01:18,225 --> 00:01:25,156; ;And what that will do is enable inline compression on data that exists on the LUN.
12; ;00:01:26,203 --> 00:01:28,546; ;It would compress it during the move.
13; ;00:01:32,052 --> 00:01:39,563; ;This shows the details of what gets moved, what attributes on the LUN get moved.
14; ;00:01:39,563 --> 00:01:43,209; ;And you can see there are some attributes that won't.
15; ;00:01:43,209 --> 00:01:54,694; ;If the LUN had a snapshot on it, the snapshot schedule comes over but not the snapshot data, somewhat like fashion replication configuration wouldn't go over.
16; ;00:01:56,132 --> 00:02:00,179; ;Also worth mentioning are the LUN type.
17; ;00:02:00,179 --> 00:02:09,588; ;If you move a thick LUN with the Unisphere GUI, after the LUN is moved, it will be a thin LUN.
18; ;00:02:09,588 --> 00:02:15,226; ;You can move it with UEMCLI and keep this type if you use the correct options.
19; ;00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:24,215; ;All right, let's talk about the process of the move.
20; ;00:02:24,215 --> 00:02:32,712; ;A host will be accessing a LUN out of its original pool normally.
21; ;00:02:34,314 --> 00:02:47,940; ;And the LUN Move feature utilizes the Transparent Data Transfer technology that was introduced in Unity before VVols.
22; ;00:02:47,940 --> 00:03:00,251; ;And it's a multi-threaded engine that transparently moves data between LUNs on the system.
23; ;00:03:00,251 --> 00:03:07,699; ;You initiate the LUN Move operation, it's not much to configure, no communication is needed.
24; ;00:03:09,971 --> 00:03:12,907; ;The LUN Move starts.
25; ;00:03:12,907 --> 00:03:25,307; ;And as we can see here, the data from the existing LUN starts to get populated onto the new LUN on the other pool.
26; ;00:03:25,307 --> 00:03:32,571; ;But the TDX engine presents the LUN in its holistic fashion to the host.
27; ;00:03:32,571 --> 00:03:37,434; ;It's totally non disruptive to the host during the move.
28; ;00:03:40,256 --> 00:03:48,527; ;And when the move completes, the LUN is fully on the new pool.
29; ;00:03:48,527 --> 00:04:01,287; ;The host has access to it, and the old LUN from the original pool is removed, and host access is normal on the new pool.
30; ;00:04:05,223 --> 00:04:14,742; ;Management of the feature, there are management for it in the Unisphere GUI, UEMCLI, and REST API.
31; ;00:04:14,742 --> 00:04:19,758; ;There are actually two ways to get to it within Unisphere.
32; ;00:04:19,758 --> 00:04:28,793; ;On a compression disabled LUN, you would simply select the LUN and from the More Actions select Move.
33; ;00:04:30,426 --> 00:04:47,954; ;If the LUN is a compression enabled LUN on a flash pool, you can choose the option Compress Now, which actually in the background performs a LUN Move within the same pool.
34; ;00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:57,134; ;And UEMCLI has a /move/session and a set of options as well as the REST API.
35; ;00:05:01,427 --> 00:05:03,839; ;What are some considerations when moving the LUN?
36; ;00:05:03,839 --> 00:05:12,791; ;Only LUNs are supported, standalone LUNs or LUNs within a consistency group.
37; ;00:05:12,791 --> 00:05:16,018; ;The LUNs can't be in a replication session.
38; ;00:05:16,018 --> 00:05:19,498; ;They can't be shrinking or expanding.
39; ;00:05:19,498 --> 00:05:24,516; ;They can't be being restored from a snapshot or imported.
40; ;00:05:24,516 --> 00:05:29,796; ;And they can't have any problem, they can't be offline, requiring any kind of recovery.
41; ;00:05:29,796 --> 00:05:37,656; ;And during the move, Unity cannot be upgraded while a Move session is ongoing.
42; ;00:05:40,819 --> 00:05:43,430; ;Move capabilities.
43; ;00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:57,238; ;LUN move is supported on the physical Unity systems and UnityVSA systems, and they will support 100 Move sessions, and 16 of those sessions can be active at one time.
44; ;00:05:59,115 --> 00:06:06,572; ;There are session priority settings, idle, low, below normal, normal, above normal, and high.
45; ;00:06:06,572 --> 00:06:10,581; ;It simply controls the IO rate of the move.
46; ;00:06:10,581 --> 00:06:27,886; ;The move is multi-threaded, there can be 16 active sessions as we stated, and the TDX technology will multiplex those into 10 concurrent sessions.
47; ;00:06:27,886 --> 00:06:35,321; ;And it uses the priority to establish what is in the concurrent session.
48; ;00:06:39,026 --> 00:06:44,434; ;And this completes the LUN Move presentation.
1; ;00:00:01,293 --> 00:00:13,352; ;The next few slides are going to take us through a step by step in the DSM of what is all involved with setting up and executing a Live Migration.
2; ;00:00:13,352 --> 00:00:18,461; ;Live Migrations really have two roles, one is source, the other is destination.
3; ;00:00:18,461 --> 00:00:23,326; ;These roles determine the active volume that is servicing IO.
4; ;00:00:23,326 --> 00:00:30,263; ;The roles can be swapped one time, either automatically or manually.
5; ;00:00:30,263 --> 00:00:37,187; ;In this example, the server sends an IO request that modifies the source volume.
6; ;00:00:37,187 --> 00:00:46,050; ;The changes to the source volume are replicated to the destination Storage Center over Fibre Channel or iSCSI.
7; ;00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:52,389; ;The process really starts even before a Live Migration.
8; ;00:00:52,389 --> 00:00:59,531; ;Before the live migration occurs, the server is sending IO requests only to the volume to be migrated.
9; ;00:00:59,531 --> 00:01:17,215; ;On the slide, the number one there, shows us the server, two is the server IO request sent to a volume in the SC system, and then three is the volume to be migrated, so it would be defined as the source volume.
10; ;00:01:17,215 --> 00:01:22,244; ;Next is the Live Migration configuration before a swap role.
11; ;00:01:22,244 --> 00:01:29,490; ;On the slide, the source SC Series is on the left and the destination SC Series is on the right.
12; ;00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:47,014; ;One is the server, two is the server IO request to the source volume, and three is the source volume, four is the replication over Fibre Channel or iSCSI, and then five is the destination volume.
13; ;00:01:47,014 --> 00:01:52,266; ;Next is the Live Migration configuration after the swap role.
14; ;00:01:52,266 --> 00:02:08,262; ;On this illustration, one is the server, two is the server IO request to the destination volume and this is forwarded to the source SC Series by the destination SC, and four is the new source volume.
15; ;00:02:08,262 --> 00:02:19,659; ;And of course, this is now the source SC Series and this is the destination SC Series after the swap role.
16; ;00:02:19,659 --> 00:02:26,357; ;And last in the process is the Live Migration configuration after the step called complete.
17; ;00:02:26,357 --> 00:02:32,147; ;And here's where the server sends IO requests now only to the migrated volume.
18; ;00:02:32,147 --> 00:02:39,994; ;Here, one is the server, two is the old destination volume here.
19; ;00:02:39,994 --> 00:02:51,279; ;Three is the migrated volume, and four is the server IO request to the migrated volume over Fibre Channel or iSCSI.
20; ;00:02:51,279 --> 00:02:57,301; ;The swap and complete functions must be executed before the Live Migration is finished.
21; ;00:02:57,301 --> 00:03:01,672; ;And we're going to talk about those here in the next few slides.
22; ;00:03:01,672 --> 00:03:11,113; ;Remember, we're going to use Live Migration to move a volume from one SC Series system to another with limited or no downtime.
23; ;00:03:11,113 --> 00:03:15,385; ;The volume to be migrated must be mapped to a server.
24; ;00:03:15,385 --> 00:03:22,579; ;The volume cannot be part of a current replication or current live volume or a current Live Migrate.
25; ;00:03:22,579 --> 00:03:30,282; ;Keep in mind Live Migration is not supported on an SCv2000 system.
26; ;00:03:30,282 --> 00:03:36,729; ;Let's kind of start by going through the step by step in the Dell Storage Manager to do a Live Migrate.
27; ;00:03:36,729 --> 00:03:41,559; ;To start the process, you're going to right click the volume that you're going to migrate.
28; ;00:03:41,559 --> 00:03:50,270; ;You select the Storage Center, right click the Volume and select the option there Live Migrate Volume.
29; ;00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:57,910; ;You also have an option to migrate multiple volumes, can be selected.
30; ;00:03:57,910 --> 00:04:10,611; ;So you see, I just got two here but I can select multiple volumes and migrate it to the same destination SC Series array with the same settings including the map server.
31; ;00:04:10,611 --> 00:04:19,128; ;And we mentioned this earlier, but remember a threshold definition can be created by the user in the Dell Storage Manager interface.
32; ;00:04:19,128 --> 00:04:29,349; ;That definition can trigger an alert, right, and that will notify the user if there are issues are warnings in the SC Series environment.
33; ;00:04:29,349 --> 00:04:41,287; ;There are four different types of threshold definitions that trigger alerts with the recommendation to move a volume from one SC Series system to another.
34; ;00:04:41,287 --> 00:04:50,144; ;The four types of alerts are IO usage alert for high front-end IOs per second on one SC Series.
35; ;00:04:50,144 --> 00:04:56,637; ;The second is an IO usage alert for high latency on a specific volume.
36; ;00:04:56,637 --> 00:05:03,895; ;The third is an IO usage alert for CPU usage on a controller in an SC Series.
37; ;00:05:03,895 --> 00:05:20,799; ;And finally, the fourth type of alert that will trigger a recommendation to move a volume is a storage alert based on the percent of storage used by one of the SC Series systems in the array.
38; ;00:05:20,799 --> 00:05:23,445; ;Let's take a look at an example.
39; ;00:05:23,445 --> 00:05:29,318; ;This is showing a threshold alert that has been generated.
40; ;00:05:29,318 --> 00:05:40,689; ;I'm going to show you in a moment, what caused that alert to show up here, but it was based on an initial threshold definition that was set up.
41; ;00:05:40,689 --> 00:05:48,726; ;When a user clicks on that, you click on the Recommend Storage Center.
42; ;00:05:48,726 --> 00:05:57,797; ;You see the alert, you right click on it, click on Recommend Storage Center, and then the Recommend Storage Center dialog box shows up.
43; ;00:05:57,797 --> 00:05:59,420; ;And it shows the reason for alerts.
44; ;00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:09,845; ;Here is the reason IO usage is the type based on latency on a volume.
45; ;00:06:09,845 --> 00:06:15,715; ;Here is the current Storage Center and here is the Recommended Storage Center.
46; ;00:06:15,715 --> 00:06:24,537; ;If you want to have it Live Migrate the volume to the Recommended Storage Center, you just click on that link there.
47; ;00:06:27,179 --> 00:06:40,825; ;That hyperlink will only be shown, so this hyperlink here will only be shown if the source Storage Center and the recommended Storage Center are SCOS 7.1 or greater.
48; ;00:06:40,825 --> 00:06:51,298; ;Generally, Dell recommends that both SC Series systems are running the same version of a SCOS when you're executing a Live Migration.
49; ;00:06:51,298 --> 00:07:05,386; ;It has to be at least 7.1 and as our volume, as our SCOS versions continue to go higher, we want to make them both same to take advantage of Live Migrate.
50; ;00:07:05,386 --> 00:07:19,449; ;When I do a Live Migration, I have an option that will show up if the user preference is set up to replicate storage to the lowest tier.
51; ;00:07:19,449 --> 00:07:26,537; ;But you'll notice this is not checked, so by default that option is false,  it won't replicate the lowest tier.
52; ;00:07:26,537 --> 00:07:39,207; ;If you check the Enabled box, when you do a Live Migrate, it will do that replication immediately to the lowest tier on the SC Series that it migrates to.
53; ;00:07:39,207 --> 00:07:45,829; ;There's a couple of other options here, there's an option to select an existing destination volume.
54; ;00:07:45,829 --> 00:07:52,306; ;The current name of the source volume will be used as the name of the destination by default.
55; ;00:07:52,306 --> 00:08:01,584; ;And you see the check there and you can use the source volume folder path, if you need to or if you've got a folder structure setup.
56; ;00:08:01,584 --> 00:08:08,078; ;There's also an option to automatically swap the volumes roles after the sync.
57; ;00:08:08,078 --> 00:08:12,892; ;And you see the check there that is enabled by default.
58; ;00:08:12,892 --> 00:08:19,238; ;Keep in mind that the roles have to be swapped in order for the Live Migration to complete.
59; ;00:08:19,238 --> 00:08:31,289; ;In fact, the next slide we take a look at is going to show the procedure to use if a user doesn't enable automatically swapping the roles, if they don't check this box.
60; ;00:08:31,289 --> 00:08:40,390; ;If a swap doesn't occur automatically, a user can swap roles manually before completing a Live Migration.
61; ;00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:50,167; ;Prerequisites for a swap: the Live Migration must be in the syncing or ready to be swapped state.
62; ;00:08:50,167 --> 00:08:56,699; ;And so you'll notice so we did is we highlighted the volume to be swapped, this guy here.
63; ;00:08:56,699 --> 00:09:00,131; ;We choose the swapped source Storage Center.
64; ;00:09:00,131 --> 00:09:03,381; ;Swaps source Storage Center.
65; ;00:09:03,381 --> 00:09:10,124; ;Since the volume is in the ready to be swapped state, that's why we can choose that option.
66; ;00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:23,600; ;After you're done and you've chosen ready to swap, the swap will go to syncing, and you see the choice there, syncing, all right, as once the swap is done, and then it'll go to ready to be completed.
67; ;00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:27,477; ;And then it'll go to ready to be completed.
68; ;00:09:27,477 --> 00:09:37,384; ;You'll also notice that, you can also cancel the swapped roles at this point if you want, you have that that flexibility as well.
69; ;00:09:37,384 --> 00:09:49,207; ;Under Edit Settings, we don't show a picture of it here with this slide, but under Edit Settings, you have an option to enable deduplication.
70; ;00:09:49,207 --> 00:09:50,841; ;We'll talk about that for a moment.
71; ;00:09:50,841 --> 00:09:59,677; ;Deduplication reduces the amount of data transferred and enhances the storage efficiency of the remote Storage Center.
72; ;00:09:59,677 --> 00:10:11,774; ;Deduplication copies only the changed portions of the snapshot history on the source volume rather than all data that's captured in each snapshot.
73; ;00:10:11,774 --> 00:10:22,516; ;So in that Edit Settings options, you can either check that you want deduplication to happen if it's not checked or remove the box if it is checked.
74; ;00:10:22,516 --> 00:10:29,286; ;Those are your choices, so you either select or clear the deduplication checkbox.
75; ;00:10:29,286 --> 00:10:42,618; ;The Live Migration must be in either Syncing or Ready to be Swapped mode in order to edit that deduplication option.
76; ;00:10:42,618 --> 00:10:52,155; ;The last step that has to be performed in a swapped roles process is an option referred to as complete.
77; ;00:10:52,155 --> 00:11:04,068; ;When we do a complete, we go to the Live Migrations tab in DSM, and highlight the volume to be completed.
78; ;00:11:04,068 --> 00:11:11,330; ;It should have a status of ready to be completed, okay?
79; ;00:11:11,330 --> 00:11:19,270; ;Under the bottom tab there, it has details about the Live Migration information.
80; ;00:11:19,270 --> 00:11:28,912; ;In this case, automatically swapped roles, no, so that's what we've gone through this process.
81; ;00:11:28,912 --> 00:11:38,000; ;The QoS Nodes tab is where the Live Migrations that are currently running are displayed with their status.
82; ;00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:47,038; ;We've got a couple under Live Migrations here in the bottom that are sitting with the status of ready to be completed.
83; ;00:11:47,038 --> 00:11:54,780; ;You click on the migration itself to edit settings or edit the schedule.
84; ;00:11:54,780 --> 00:12:12,147; ;To complete a Live Migration what that does, it stops the server IO request to the old source SC Series and then it sends all new IO requests only to the destination SC Series.
85; ;00:12:12,147 --> 00:12:19,782; ;Remember, the old destination SC is now the new source SC because we swapped roles.
86; ;00:12:19,782 --> 00:12:28,545; ;You can complete a single Live Migration or multiple Live Migrations at one time, either way.
87; ;00:12:28,545 --> 00:12:43,205; ;A couple prerequisites to do this step called Complete: swap roles must be complete for the Live Migration and the Live Migration must be in a Ready to be Completed state.
88; ;00:12:43,205 --> 00:12:47,775; ;Let's finish up this module with a couple of review questions.
89; ;00:12:47,775 --> 00:12:57,369; ;First one here, what licensing is required to Live Migrate volumes in Federated SC arrays?
90; ;00:12:57,369 --> 00:12:58,811; ;What do you think?
91; ;00:12:58,811 --> 00:13:00,308; ;Yep.
92; ;00:13:00,308 --> 00:13:05,833; ;No licensing is required, because Live Migrate is included in the base license.
93; ;00:13:05,833 --> 00:13:15,590; ;Just to reinforce that Live Volume, there is a license replication, there's a license, but Live Migrate is included in the base.
94; ;00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:23,913; ;Number two: What feature in Dell Storage Manager recommends volume movement from one array to another?
95; ;00:13:23,913 --> 00:13:25,867; ;That one is Volume Advisor.
96; ;00:13:25,867 --> 00:13:28,410; ;Good. Good.
97; ;00:13:28,410 --> 00:13:32,242; ;And finally, what's the difference between Live Migrate and Live Volume?
98; ;00:13:32,242 --> 00:13:35,085; ;Touched on it briefly.
99; ;00:13:35,085 --> 00:13:44,368; ;Remember, Live Migrate is about volume movement and Live Volume is about high availability and disaster recovery.
1; ;00:00:01,195 --> 00:00:05,680; ;Let's get into the next section here, we'll start with the discussion question.
2; ;00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:14,105; ;You remember the main enhancement of Live Volume in SCOS 7.1 that we've just talked about.
3; ;00:00:14,105 --> 00:00:17,439; ;Live Volume auto failover with Microsoft.
4; ;00:00:17,439 --> 00:00:19,753; ;Good, good.
5; ;00:00:19,753 --> 00:00:24,528; ;We're going to talk a lot about Federation here in this section.
6; ;00:00:24,528 --> 00:00:29,213; ;Federation really is a journey and not a complete solution.
7; ;00:00:29,213 --> 00:00:37,776; ;The next few slides will kind of start us along that journey with features that helped to make up the Federation story.
8; ;00:00:37,776 --> 00:00:46,968; ;SC Series Federation today is a combination of Dell Storage Manager, Live Migrate, and Volume Advisor.
9; ;00:00:46,968 --> 00:00:51,117; ;And we'll talk about all these as we go through the next few slides.
10; ;00:00:51,117 --> 00:01:02,385; ;Dell Storage Manager is the federation boundary, so it recognizes new arrays, new SC Series as they're added, and need to be managed.
11; ;00:01:02,385 --> 00:01:13,215; ;Live Migrate, which is the feature in version SCOS 7.1, provides the functionality that moves volumes between arrays with no downtime.
12; ;00:01:13,215 --> 00:01:18,764; ;And Volume Advisor is intelligent initial volume placement on arrays.
13; ;00:01:18,764 --> 00:01:27,695; ;It also has the ability to recommend the movement of volumes based on space needs, IOPS or threshold requirements.
14; ;00:01:27,695 --> 00:01:32,374; ;We're going to talk about all those in some more detail.
15; ;00:01:32,374 --> 00:01:43,475; ;Synchronous replication between systems in the federation really provides the vehicle that allows the volumes to be moved between Storage Centers.
16; ;00:01:43,475 --> 00:01:52,010; ;Volumes can be moved between arrays with no downtime and no impact to snapshots or replications.
17; ;00:01:52,010 --> 00:02:02,837; ;The Volume Advisor feature can suggest, as we said, the best array to move a volume as well as the best place, best array to put a new volume.
18; ;00:02:02,837 --> 00:02:09,325; ;Another benefit is this, in the Storage Centers in a federation don't have to be the same type.
19; ;00:02:09,325 --> 00:02:11,918; ;It can be heterogeneous federation.
20; ;00:02:11,918 --> 00:02:23,715; ;SC4020, SC7020, SC8000, SC9000, and even the older series 40 systems can all be mixed in a federation environment.
21; ;00:02:23,715 --> 00:02:34,863; ;And data can be moved around between all these different systems using this combination of DSM, Live Migrate, and Volume Advisor.
22; ;00:02:34,863 --> 00:02:45,223; ;So as we said, Live Migrate was released as a SCOS 7.1 and runs on Dell Storage Manager 2016R2 and greater.
23; ;00:02:45,223 --> 00:02:48,329; ;What is Live Migrate?
24; ;00:02:48,329 --> 00:03:00,022; ;It really facilitates one-way migration of an SC volume from one SC array to another, particularly in a federated environment.
25; ;00:03:00,022 --> 00:03:05,608; ;It provides that volume migration workflow for migrating a volume from one to another.
26; ;00:03:05,608 --> 00:03:12,713; ;One thing that's really key about it, it does not require a Live Volume or replication license.
27; ;00:03:12,713 --> 00:03:17,314; ;So this is one of the huge distinctions between Live Migrate and Live Volume.
28; ;00:03:17,314 --> 00:03:22,965; ;There is no license required, it's part of the base license as of SCOS 7.1.
29; ;00:03:22,965 --> 00:03:37,792; ;Live Migrate also offers a simplified workflow and this is all run through the Dell Storage Manager because it's really integrated into Volume Advisor which as we said is part of DSM.
30; ;00:03:37,792 --> 00:03:49,364; ;It works through all of the different SC Series except the SCv2000, so even though, as we said, even the older series 40s can use Live Migrate.
31; ;00:03:49,364 --> 00:03:52,205; ;It can federate multiple systems, that's the other beauty of it.
32; ;00:03:52,205 --> 00:04:01,358; ;I can have for example, 10 SC9000 managed under a single-user interface.
33; ;00:04:01,358 --> 00:04:11,171; ;It allows a federation domain to scale environments as high as 60 petabytes raw and as many as 40,000 volumes.
34; ;00:04:11,171 --> 00:04:17,686; ;Live Migrate allows us to tell a federation story without having to discuss Live Volume.
35; ;00:04:17,686 --> 00:04:31,585; ;Live Volume going forward, will kind of morph into more of a disaster recovery or high availability solution where federation is about movement and the balancing of workloads in a data center.
36; ;00:04:31,585 --> 00:04:37,450; ;Certainly, people get confused with Live Volume and Live Migrate.
37; ;00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:39,136; ;Think of it this way.
38; ;00:04:39,136 --> 00:04:57,816; ;Live Volume is a built-in disaster recovery and disaster avoidance solution that enables always available storage with no disruption to workloads and no loss of data in the event of unplanned outages and disasters, so that's really the key there.
39; ;00:04:57,816 --> 00:05:15,187; ;Live Migrate on the other hand is a solution built into SCOS that enables multisystem federation across SC arrays allowing for the online migration of workloads with no downtime or disruption to the host.
40; ;00:05:15,187 --> 00:05:23,075; ;So it's not built for, unplanned outages or disasters like Live Volume is.
41; ;00:05:23,075 --> 00:05:33,103; ;Live Migrate, it's simply developed for online migrations, particularly in a federation environment.
42; ;00:05:33,103 --> 00:05:44,603; ;So let's take a look at a video that is going to provide an overview of federation as well as a good discussion of how Live Migrate works and how it's licensed.
43; ;00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:54,318; ;Hello, Josh Raw here from the Dell Storage product planning team.
44; ;00:05:54,318 --> 00:05:57,530; ;Today, I'm here to talk to you about Dell Storage Federation.
45; ;00:05:57,530 --> 00:06:01,443; ;And this is specifically with the Dell Storage SC Series here.
46; ;00:06:01,443 --> 00:06:08,121; ;We came out with this concept years ago, I think it was back in 2009-2010 type of time frame.
47; ;00:06:08,121 --> 00:06:11,878; ;We came out with the ability to what we call Live Volume.
48; ;00:06:11,878 --> 00:06:20,502; ;So this was right on the heels of VMware and Microsoft coming out with their VMotion or Live Migrate technologies.
49; ;00:06:20,502 --> 00:06:29,971; ;This allowed the ability to migrate workloads from one compute node to another compute node without any downtime to that application or virtual machine that was running it.
50; ;00:06:29,971 --> 00:06:31,831; ;And so we're thinking that was great.
51; ;00:06:31,831 --> 00:06:43,338; ;I can now scale out my environment to add more compute capacity to my environment, migrate workloads around to the best storage or best compute place, without any downtime.
52; ;00:06:43,338 --> 00:06:48,269; ;We were having multiple customers buying multiple storage arrays in the environment.
53; ;00:06:48,269 --> 00:06:53,733; ;We're thinking, "Wouldn't that be great if we could offer our customers the same kind of technology here?"
54; ;00:06:53,733 --> 00:06:56,755; ;So we came out with the Live Volume technology.
55; ;00:06:56,755 --> 00:07:02,421; ;This allowed us to migrate workloads from one storage array to another storage array with zero downtime.
56; ;00:07:02,421 --> 00:07:08,506; ;So if you look at how that functions in there, we'll start at the compute side first here.
57; ;00:07:08,506 --> 00:07:18,113; ;Maybe you have ESX or Hyper-V layer here, and I've got multiple virtual machines running on those environments.
58; ;00:07:18,113 --> 00:07:30,381; ;With VMotion technology or Live Migrate technology, I can migrate those virtual machines to new nodes here with no downtime to the application or virtual machine that's running that.
59; ;00:07:30,381 --> 00:07:38,235; ;With the storage side of things, of course, our virtual machines need storage in this environment, so I may start with one storage array in my environment.
60; ;00:07:38,235 --> 00:07:44,885; ;One SC storage here with a particular volume that's presenting all my virtual machine workflows.
61; ;00:07:44,885 --> 00:07:51,411; ;Maybe this Storage Center is running out of either compute horsepower or auto capacity.
62; ;00:07:51,411 --> 00:07:58,053; ;What we can do in a federated environment is add another storage array in the environment.
63; ;00:07:58,053 --> 00:08:05,173; ;And we can do this because we managed a multiple arrays raise through what we call our Enterprise Manager product.
64; ;00:08:10,295 --> 00:08:17,762; ;Enterprise Manager sees multiple arrays in the environment and can transition this Live Volume workflow.
65; ;00:08:17,762 --> 00:08:26,230; ;So if I've got a particular volume that's filling up or it needs to be migrated from one array to another, from Enterprise Manager.
66; ;00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:43,975; ;I can start this Live Volume migration to bring in a volume on the secondary array, present it to my virtual machines here and perform a migration task leaving that volume migrated to a new storage array with zero downtime to my applications or hosts in this.
67; ;00:08:43,975 --> 00:08:48,526; ;That's this all functionality that we've had for quite some time.
68; ;00:08:48,526 --> 00:08:52,887; ;Enterprise Manager also has this ability called Volume Advisor.
69; ;00:08:52,887 --> 00:08:59,087; ;Volume Advisor, what its functionality really is to do is to look at my multiple arrays in my environment.
70; ;00:08:59,087 --> 00:09:06,466; ;When I'm creating new storage volumes in my environment, it can recommend the placement on what storage array to put that on.
71; ;00:09:06,466 --> 00:09:13,565; ;For instance, one may be running out of capacity, it will recommend putting new volumes on a different storage array in that environment.
72; ;00:09:13,565 --> 00:09:17,881; ;As well as it will also recommend movement of volumes in my environment.
73; ;00:09:17,881 --> 00:09:33,359; ;So today if my arrays are licensed for Live Volume, it will recommend that maybe this one's running out of capacity or performance, it will recommend moving a volume from one array to another to alleviate that issues here.
74; ;00:09:33,359 --> 00:09:36,226; ;That's all functionality that is there today.
75; ;00:09:36,226 --> 00:09:39,178; ;Of course, Live Volume requires a few things.
76; ;00:09:39,178 --> 00:09:46,463; ;It requires a replication license as well as the Live Volume license to be able to operate in that environment.
77; ;00:09:46,463 --> 00:09:56,231; ;Here in Storage Center 7.1, we're going to introduce the capability what we call Live Migrate into Storage Center and Enterprise Manager.
78; ;00:09:56,231 --> 00:10:01,503; ;Live Migrate does not require a replication or Live Volume license.
79; ;00:10:01,503 --> 00:10:05,168; ;Live Migrate is built into the base functionality of every array.
80; ;00:10:05,168 --> 00:10:11,738; ;If you can run Storage Center 7.1 on the array, you are able to do Live Migrate operations with this.
81; ;00:10:11,738 --> 00:10:20,150; ;Just like Live Volume, it's a one-way street where Live Volume has kind of turned into more of a HA or DR product.
82; ;00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:25,630; ;Especially with Live Volume auto-failover capabilities, with Live Migrate it's a one-way street.
83; ;00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:41,833; ;It essentially uses some of the same technology as Live Volume, but it's one-way operation so it migrates the data over there as well as the mapping profiles to the new hosts allowing me to seamlessly migrate my data in the environment.
84; ;00:10:41,833 --> 00:10:50,922; ;Especially, if you start looking at some of our products, we have the SC9000, great scale up to 6 petabytes of storage behind it.
85; ;00:10:50,922 --> 00:10:57,500; ;A lot of customers do not want to put that much storage behind the environment and they want to go with smaller arrays in their environment.
86; ;00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:03,940; ;Maybe they choose the SC4000 or maybe the SC7000 coming up here shortly.
87; ;00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:15,650; ;To keep my boundaries low on if I have data corruption or something like that, I want to keep my byte-size chunks in there.
88; ;00:11:15,655 --> 00:11:26,772; ;They'll choose to add multiple arrays to my environment and scale out that workloads to keep my disaster boundaries a little bit smaller in that environment.
89; ;00:11:26,772 --> 00:11:32,648; ;Thank you for joining us today, and this is Storage Federation.
90; ;00:11:32,648 --> 00:11:38,179; ;I want to leave you with that, Live Migrate operations coming out soon and look for that technology.
91; ;00:11:38,179 --> 00:11:39,192; ;Thank you.
1; ;00:00:00,839 --> 00:00:10,114; ;In the next few slides, we'll discuss Live Volume features and what's new with Live Volume in the release of SCOS 7.1.
2; ;00:00:10,114 --> 00:00:13,148; ;We'll start with the discussion question.
3; ;00:00:13,148 --> 00:00:16,352; ;What is Live Volume in the SC Series?
4; ;00:00:16,352 --> 00:00:17,849; ;Anybody have any idea?
5; ;00:00:17,849 --> 00:00:19,313; ;Go on and think about that.
6; ;00:00:21,721 --> 00:00:33,996; ;A Live Volume is defined as a special volume that is replicated and mapped to host from both a source and destination SC Series system at the same time.
7; ;00:00:33,996 --> 00:00:40,199; ;And we'll be talking about how that works and the value of that and when you would use it.
8; ;00:00:40,199 --> 00:00:48,781; ;For disaster avoidance and advanced storage migrations, ensuring data is highly available, or for quick disaster recovery.
9; ;00:00:48,781 --> 00:00:53,891; ;SC Series Live Volume feature acts as a storage hypervisor.
10; ;00:00:53,891 --> 00:01:01,005; ;Live Volume allows data to be copied between arrays with no interruption to host access.
11; ;00:01:01,005 --> 00:01:10,002; ;Storage essentially follows the application as migrated volumes automatically map to associated hosts, regardless of physical location.
12; ;00:01:10,002 --> 00:01:14,623; ;Live Volume supports any virtualized server environment.
13; ;00:01:14,623 --> 00:01:20,641; ;Live Volume functionality is fully integrated into the virtualized SC Series platform.
14; ;00:01:20,641 --> 00:01:25,237; ;This eliminates the need for additional hardware or server side agents.
15; ;00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:40,142; ;Synchronous replication capability keeps Live Volumes 100% consistent, allowing them to also be used for planned as well as unplanned outages and disaster recovery.
16; ;00:01:40,142 --> 00:01:52,421; ;With synchronous Live Volume, a recovery point objective, or RPO, of zero can be established and met so that all the customers' data is protected.
17; ;00:01:52,421 --> 00:02:01,782; ;Since server mappings are virtualized, no host side changes are required to manually restore data access using a secondary array.
18; ;00:02:01,782 --> 00:02:06,875; ;The recovery time objectives can be reduced to minutes.
19; ;00:02:06,875 --> 00:02:19,451; ;Live Volume has a Managed Replication feature that replicates data to a third recovery site, enabling a more robust variety of disaster recovery plans.
20; ;00:02:19,451 --> 00:02:26,341; ;Live Volume Managed Replication is specifically designed to leverage Live Volume's capabilities.
21; ;00:02:26,341 --> 00:02:48,424; ;Whenever SC Series swaps primary and secondary arrays, either manually for disaster recovery, or automatically in response to changing traffic patterns, the third site arrays shifts its replication source to the new primary volume, ensuring more comprehensive business continuity and data protection.
22; ;00:02:49,925 --> 00:03:03,474; ;In SCOS 6.7 and Enterprise Manager 2015 R2, Live Volume auto failover was introduced in VMware environments.
23; ;00:03:03,474 --> 00:03:09,451; ;SC Series customers could create a failsafe high-availability environment.
24; ;00:03:09,451 --> 00:03:17,175; ;As we said, Live Volume virtualizes LUN mappings to keep host applications running even during storage changes.
25; ;00:03:17,175 --> 00:03:22,442; ;Hosts can write to and/or read from the mirrored volume on either array.
26; ;00:03:22,442 --> 00:03:26,560; ;They just see multiple paths to the same volume.
27; ;00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:37,573; ;With the release of SCOS 7.1 and Dell Storage Manager 2016 R2, Live Volume auto failover has been added to Windows environments.
28; ;00:03:38,863 --> 00:03:51,796; ;This includes support for Windows 2008 and 2008R2, 2012, 2012R2, Hyper-V, and physical clustering.
29; ;00:03:54,708 --> 00:04:09,986; ;This release also supports VMware's physical mode raw device maps, or pRDMs, used mainly for Windows in-guest clustering of Windows Servers that are running on top of ESX hypervisors.
30; ;00:04:09,986 --> 00:04:17,269; ;It's built into the SC Series solution, so there's no extra hardware or software that's required.
31; ;00:04:17,269 --> 00:04:25,834; ;It also provides auto failover replication support for Live Volume Managed Replication.
32; ;00:04:25,834 --> 00:04:36,403; ;SCOS 7.1 and Dell Storage Manager 2016 R2 also provide some stretch cluster support enhancements to VMware.
33; ;00:04:36,403 --> 00:04:48,605; ;In a vSphere Metro Storage Cluster, VMSC, failed virtual machines are restored on new physical servers without losing their storage mappings.
34; ;00:04:48,605 --> 00:05:01,723; ;The main feature released with SCOS 6.7 with Live Volume was support for automatic failover with synchronous replication in a VM environment.
35; ;00:05:01,723 --> 00:05:07,895; ;This allowed us to share a virtual storage volume between two arrays in a synchronous topology.
36; ;00:05:07,895 --> 00:05:16,488; ;Previous to that, as of 6.5 is when synchronous replication for Live Volume was introduced.
37; ;00:05:16,488 --> 00:05:21,746; ;So even prior to 6.5, it was only asynchronous in a Live Volume environment.
38; ;00:05:21,746 --> 00:05:29,719; ;And really synchronous replication provides the foundation for auto failover with Live Volume.
39; ;00:05:29,719 --> 00:05:34,743; ;The whole idea was to provide a solution with no single point of failure.
40; ;00:05:36,329 --> 00:05:49,703; ;With 7.1, we've incorporated that same functionality, that automatic failover between arrays functionality is supported in Microsoft environments.
41; ;00:05:49,703 --> 00:05:55,325; ;In this example we show a Live Volume being used with clustered server.
42; ;00:05:55,325 --> 00:06:05,453; ;In this example, the cluster is a stretch cluster where we've got part of the cluster in Storage Center A and the other side in Storage Center B.
43; ;00:06:05,453 --> 00:06:09,149; ;They're probably synchronously replicated between the two.
44; ;00:06:09,149 --> 00:06:16,156; ;Data passes from host A to Storage Center A and then is replicated to Storage Center B.
45; ;00:06:16,156 --> 00:06:26,243; ;Now if data...so everything is fine here, data is writing from the virtualized host into Storage Center A.
46; ;00:06:26,243 --> 00:06:40,018; ;If something were to happen to that host, it will switch over, the VM moves down here to virtualized host B because this guy is down at the moment.
47; ;00:06:40,018 --> 00:06:45,968; ;Then data will write up through Storage Center B up to Storage Center A.
48; ;00:06:45,968 --> 00:06:58,337; ;Since the data is now coming from B, we'll swap roles and the primary Live Volume that was up there will be down here to Storage Center B.
49; ;00:06:58,337 --> 00:07:09,956; ;So now host B will go to Storage Center B and then be replicated up to Storage Center A, at least until we get the host A back online again.
50; ;00:07:09,956 --> 00:07:19,982; ;As we said, Live Volume auto failover is supported in a VMware virtual infrastructure in both Uniform and Non-Uniform host access configurations.
51; ;00:07:19,982 --> 00:07:23,549; ;This was as of SCOS 6.7.
52; ;00:07:23,549 --> 00:07:32,901; ;This slide is going to demonstrate Live Volume auto failover in a Uniform access scenario since that's really more common than the Non-Uniform.
53; ;00:07:32,901 --> 00:07:36,797; ;But realize they both are supported.
54; ;00:07:36,797 --> 00:07:45,308; ;The difference between the two is the Uniform access provides VMware host mapping to the Live Volume through both arrays.
55; ;00:07:45,308 --> 00:07:53,357; ;And it also provides the ability for the workload to continue running even though a site or array has failed.
56; ;00:07:53,357 --> 00:08:06,770; ;The difference then with the Non-Uniform access is the VMware host is mapped to only one array and utilizes VMware high availability to failover the VMs from the failed site or array.
57; ;00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:19,459; ;We're going to walk through the animation on this slide here in a moment, just to give you an idea of how Live Volume auto failover works in a VMware Uniform host access configuration.
58; ;00:08:19,459 --> 00:08:28,660; ;But of course realize this exact same scenario will work in a Windows environment as of SCOS 7.1.
59; ;00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:40,762; ;In our scenario here, we've got actually three data centers A, B, and C, and the Dell Storage Manager of course can manage all of these systems.
60; ;00:08:40,762 --> 00:08:49,169; ;It says Uniform mapping, well we're mapping only two arrays SC1, Storage Center 1 and Storage Center 2.
61; ;00:08:49,169 --> 00:08:59,319; ;This is where we're replicating the data between the primary Live Volume to the secondary Live Volume.
62; ;00:08:59,319 --> 00:09:03,047; ;So what happens if a disaster strikes data center A?
63; ;00:09:03,047 --> 00:09:12,885; ;What we're showing is that everything goes down in A, so the Storage Center, the host, obviously the links, everything connected with it go down.
64; ;00:09:14,227 --> 00:09:36,235; ;The DSM witness, because that's actually sitting in data center 3, and Storage Center 2 establish a quorum and trigger the promotion of the secondary site or Storage Center 2 to take over, to become the primary Live Volume.
65; ;00:09:37,297 --> 00:09:46,891; ;So at that point because this has failed because we have the backup location, VM1 will move down to here as well.
66; ;00:09:46,891 --> 00:09:51,028; ;And this has already moved, so this is now the primary Live Volume.
67; ;00:09:51,028 --> 00:09:54,410; ;And Storage Center 2 has become the primary.
68; ;00:09:54,410 --> 00:10:07,374; ;Once site A is brought back online, the SC Series, the SCOS actually prevents split brain, and that's huge, right?
69; ;00:10:07,374 --> 00:10:15,179; ;The SCOS auto-repairs the Live Volume and that's a big thing with the auto failover feature.
70; ;00:10:15,179 --> 00:10:19,574; ;It automatically will repair the Live Volume.
71; ;00:10:19,574 --> 00:10:29,323; ;It will re-establish the sync and systems are once again in protected mode, all done through the Live Volume software.
72; ;00:10:29,323 --> 00:10:38,970; ;And as we said, VMware is featured here in this example, but as of 7.1, in a Windows environment, this would work the same way.
73; ;00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:45,027; ;Let's walk through another Live Volume scenario here and see how the data is recovered.
74; ;00:10:45,027 --> 00:10:56,648; ;In this scenario, the primary volume on Storage Center A fails for whatever reason, might be a bad HBA, might just be a bad cable, something along that line.
75; ;00:10:56,648 --> 00:11:07,999; ;Notice that when the primary volume then becomes inaccessible, access to that volume moves to the secondary data center over here in Storage Center B.
76; ;00:11:10,222 --> 00:11:22,901; ;There is a connection between Storage Center B and Storage Center C, so the data can also be replicated to a remote location just in case of a site disaster.
77; ;00:11:22,901 --> 00:11:41,015; ;The connection between Storage Center A and B can be either synchronous or asynchronous, but we show it as synchronous here, and that's the most common way that you'd connect there between two geographically close locations.
78; ;00:11:41,015 --> 00:11:57,451; ;The connection between Storage Center B and Storage Center C can also be either synchronous or asynchronous, but again, most common is going to be asynchronous, because Storage Center C is typically a disaster recovery data center.
79; ;00:11:57,451 --> 00:12:03,357; ;And it's located a long distance from both Storage Center A and Storage Center B.
80; ;00:12:03,357 --> 00:12:15,295; ;So this ability to asynchronously replicate to a disaster recovery location is a very powerful feature that is referred to as we talked about it earlier Live Volume Managed Replication.
81; ;00:12:15,295 --> 00:12:25,321; ;Live Volume Managed Replication works well but can only be set up between the primary Live Volume and the DR site.
82; ;00:12:25,321 --> 00:12:27,654; ;So it has to be, it's only primary.
83; ;00:12:27,654 --> 00:12:30,988; ;It can't work from a secondary Live Volume location.
84; ;00:12:30,988 --> 00:12:39,930; ;That's why it's important that the primary Live Volume gets moved when the main Live Volume fails.
85; ;00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:50,696; ;Notice then in the animation there on the slide, you see once Storage Center A is recovered, it goes back to being the primary Live Volume.
86; ;00:12:50,690 --> 00:12:55,560; ;The Live Volume application is what's doing this.
87; ;00:12:55,560 --> 00:13:07,050; ;But you see that when the primary storage center comes back online, the connection to the DR site moves with the primary Live Volume and the disaster recovery site.
88; ;00:13:07,052 --> 00:13:20,464; ;Now we see everything back as it originally was: I've got the primary Live Volume here, I'm replicating to the secondary data center over here, and I'm going asynchronously down to Storage Center C.
89; ;00:13:20,464 --> 00:13:31,068; ;What if there's a natural disaster or some such and both Storage Center sites A and B are clobbered?
90; ;00:13:31,068 --> 00:13:50,747; ;Well, here is of course the advantage of having Storage Center C in a remote location, because in Storage Center C, because I have this Live Managed Replication, I'll be able to take the active snapshot and recover back to the view volume.
91; ;00:13:50,747 --> 00:14:00,859; ;And if I'm taking these snapshots every 15 minutes, I will have a view volume back at 11:45 that I can recover back to.
92; ;00:14:00,859 --> 00:14:13,996; ;This is just the snapshot volume that was taken 15 minutes prior to the active snapshot, and this being the current running volume as after the disaster.
93; ;00:14:13,996 --> 00:14:18,026; ;Let's go through a couple of review questions here, starting with the first one.
94; ;00:14:18,026 --> 00:14:22,102; ;What types of replication are supported with Live Volume?
95; ;00:14:25,578 --> 00:14:30,008; ;Yeah, that's going to be synchronous and asynchronous.
96; ;00:14:30,008 --> 00:14:31,489; ;Good.
97; ;00:14:31,489 --> 00:14:38,731; ;What environments are supported with Live Volume auto failover as of SCOS version 7.1?
98; ;00:14:40,774 --> 00:14:43,222; ;That's VMware and Microsoft.
99; ;00:14:43,222 --> 00:14:47,553; ;VMware started in 6.7, Microsoft in 7.1.
100; ;00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:53,448; ;What environments are supported with Live Volume async/sync with manual failover?
101; ;00:14:55,187 --> 00:14:56,209; ;Okay.
102; ;00:14:56,209 --> 00:15:02,308; ;That's all operating systems supported by SCOS and running MPIO.
103; ;00:15:02,308 --> 00:15:11,231; ;And finally, what technology allows a Live Volume to replicate with a third SC Series array and follow the primary Live Volume?
104; ;00:15:11,231 --> 00:15:13,517; ;We talked about that quite a bit.
105; ;00:15:13,517 --> 00:15:18,100; ;Yeah, Live Volume Managed Replication.
106; ;00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:19,155; ;Good.
1; ;00:00:01,303 --> 00:00:12,469; ;Next, we'll review what screens are available from the viewers menu and also see how to set up and view different reports as well as how to set up and monitor threshold alerts.
2; ;00:00:12,469 --> 00:00:18,248; ;These next handful of screens that you'll see have been available in Enterprise Manager for quite some time.
3; ;00:00:18,248 --> 00:00:23,013; ;And now they've just been ported over into Dell Storage Manager.
4; ;00:00:23,013 --> 00:00:27,168; ;DSM includes other viewers to help monitor system resources.
5; ;00:00:27,168 --> 00:00:30,036; ;You kind of see those viewers in the lower left hand corner.
6; ;00:00:30,036 --> 00:00:32,163; ;And of course, we have them displayed up here.
7; ;00:00:32,163 --> 00:00:40,020; ;Let's take a quick thumbnail of each of these and then we're going to dive into more details as we go forward.
8; ;00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:48,258; ;Storage is just manage and display information about the Storage Center, which we've really focused on so far in our examination of the interface.
9; ;00:00:48,258 --> 00:00:53,164; ;Servers, display server and mapped volume information.
10; ;00:00:53,164 --> 00:01:02,362; ;Replications & Live Volumes displays current volumes which are replicating, activating, or restoring back to the primary site.
11; ;00:01:02,362 --> 00:01:05,415; ;Monitoring, which is Alerts viewer.
12; ;00:01:05,415 --> 00:01:14,322; ;Threshold Alerts, which is where we can create threshold definitions, view threshold alerts, create and run threshold queries.
13; ;00:01:14,322 --> 00:01:21,174; ;Chargeback, this where we can create reports displaying storage costs by department.
14; ;00:01:21,174 --> 00:01:25,737; ;And this is a separate license required for Chargeback, so that's why there's an additional charge.
15; ;00:01:25,737 --> 00:01:32,368; ;And then finally Reports, and these are the automated reports that are generated that can be viewed from here.
16; ;00:01:32,368 --> 00:01:36,643; ;We'll talk about each of these in some more detail as we move forward.
17; ;00:01:36,643 --> 00:01:40,698; ;We'll start our look through the viewers by looking at the monitoring viewer.
18; ;00:01:40,698 --> 00:01:48,622; ;The monitoring viewer displays Storage Center alerts, events, and storage logs.
19; ;00:01:48,622 --> 00:01:57,187; ;Here, you can see all the alerts or events or logs for all of your Storage Centers from that single pane of glass.
20; ;00:01:57,187 --> 00:02:11,650; ;Certainly, you could uncheck any of these and, say, look at just one, look at multiple, but if you look under Storage Array here, you'll see, you know, 3, 14, there's some more with 3, 25.
21; ;00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:19,304; ;You'll see all of those listed here because we're saying, "Show me all of the alerts."
22; ;00:02:19,304 --> 00:02:22,708; ;You're just going to click monitoring from down here.
23; ;00:02:22,708 --> 00:02:34,178; ;And then if you want to see alerts, you click Alerts, if you want to see events, click Events, Storage Logs, or Audit Logs, any of those can be seen right from the Monitoring viewer.
24; ;00:02:34,178 --> 00:02:41,283; ;As we have discussed, DSM collects and stores information from all configured Storage Centers.
25; ;00:02:41,283 --> 00:02:47,910; ;Information can be viewed by generating reports from the Storage Center Client.
26; ;00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:56,129; ;Reports can be generated manually or automatically for the following types.
27; ;00:02:56,129 --> 00:03:04,293; ;We have Storage Center Summary, Volume Storage, Disk Class, Replications, and Alerts.
28; ;00:03:04,293 --> 00:03:07,091; ;You see those five across the top here.
29; ;00:03:07,091 --> 00:03:10,018; ;Remember, these are reports that are generated for us.
30; ;00:03:10,018 --> 00:03:20,034; ;So I can click on any one of these and potentially see reports by any five as long as I have set those five different choices up.
31; ;00:03:20,034 --> 00:03:23,172; ;And we'll talk about that coming up in a few slides.
32; ;00:03:23,172 --> 00:03:29,900; ;You'll notice that you have daily, weekly, or potentially monthly reports.
33; ;00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:33,132; ;And you can look at any one of those as you go through.
34; ;00:03:33,132 --> 00:03:39,284; ;Reports can also include table reports for IO as well as storage.
35; ;00:03:39,284 --> 00:03:47,169; ;We just talked about the Reports viewer, and we see this list of reports in the Reports viewer slide.
36; ;00:03:47,169 --> 00:03:55,781; ;We'll talk more about the Reports viewer and get some more details on it, but one question comes up is where do these reports come from?
37; ;00:03:55,781 --> 00:03:59,426; ;They're actually, they come from being scheduled.
38; ;00:03:59,426 --> 00:04:01,998; ;You can schedule automated reports.
39; ;00:04:01,998 --> 00:04:03,564; ;So where is that done?
40; ;00:04:03,564 --> 00:04:12,740; ;Well, you actually go under the Summary tab and on the top there's Edit Data Collector Settings and then Automated Reports.
41; ;00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:19,174; ;As far as Automated Reports go, you can see all of the different ways that we can get reports.
42; ;00:04:19,174 --> 00:04:32,029; ;Here are those five ways that we talked about, different reports that you can see, by Storage Center Summary, by Disk Class, Alerts, Volume Storage, and Replications.
43; ;00:04:32,029 --> 00:04:35,715; ;Also, you see where the daily, weekly, and monthly came from.
44; ;00:04:35,715 --> 00:04:38,423; ;In this case, we've got them all checked.
45; ;00:04:38,423 --> 00:04:47,157; ;One of the things we found from our customers is sometimes that can really load them down with reports, and so some of them, they go well.
46; ;00:04:47,157 --> 00:04:50,663; ;Here's another 10 reports that I don't use.
47; ;00:04:50,663 --> 00:04:55,081; ;After a while, you might want to uncheck a lot of these depending on how often you look at it.
48; ;00:04:55,081 --> 00:05:03,187; ;Maybe you don't need these every single day or maybe you just need alerts on a daily basis but not volume storage for example.
49; ;00:05:03,187 --> 00:05:08,512; ;There's also Table Reports Settings for either IO Reports or Storage Reports.
50; ;00:05:08,512 --> 00:05:09,955; ;And these are real valuable.
51; ;00:05:09,955 --> 00:05:18,829; ;You have the daily, weekly, monthly, and you may not want all of those, but look at some of the report types particularly for IOs.
52; ;00:05:18,829 --> 00:05:25,177; ;I have what are the Most Active Volumes, what are the Most Active Servers, what are the Most Active Disks.
53; ;00:05:25,177 --> 00:05:28,706; ;I can get all of that from the IO Table Report.
54; ;00:05:28,706 --> 00:05:31,445; ;Then we also have Storage Reports.
55; ;00:05:31,445 --> 00:05:39,578; ;Volume Reports, Server Reports, all giving us an idea of how full is the storage getting.
56; ;00:05:39,578 --> 00:05:42,287; ;There's also Chargeback Reports.
57; ;00:05:42,287 --> 00:05:47,944; ;These report options, I can store these reports in a public directory.
58; ;00:05:47,944 --> 00:05:55,126; ;Here we went to the local hard drive, just threw it in, made a report called Reports.
59; ;00:05:55,126 --> 00:06:03,456; ;However, you can put this somewhere where maybe only the managers have permissions to access the reports in that directory.
60; ;00:06:03,456 --> 00:06:11,147; ;Also, you can attach automated reports to an email just as you can attach table reports to an email.
61; ;00:06:11,147 --> 00:06:26,730; ;The other cool thing about this screen, these reports can be in whatever format that you want, any of these five at least, or six, excuse me, Text, CSV, XML, Excel, HTML, or PDF.
62; ;00:06:26,730 --> 00:06:33,364; ;It just might be what that particular user is comfortable in getting.
63; ;00:06:33,364 --> 00:06:43,517; ;These reports are generated automatically for all of the systems that are being managed from this DSM.
64; ;00:06:43,517 --> 00:06:49,891; ;You can also select to do these same reports by an individual SC Series as well.
65; ;00:06:49,891 --> 00:06:54,587; ;You don't necessarily have to do it globally, you can choose an individual one.
66; ;00:06:54,587 --> 00:07:00,636; ;As we said, these are automatically generated at certain times of the day, week, or month.
67; ;00:07:00,636 --> 00:07:05,404; ;But you also have the ability to run a report now.
68; ;00:07:05,404 --> 00:07:12,310; ;There is the option, just click on Generate Reports Now, and this screen will show up.
69; ;00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:14,865; ;Generate daily, weekly, or monthly reports.
70; ;00:07:14,865 --> 00:07:19,094; ;So I can run these reports then at any time.
71; ;00:07:19,094 --> 00:07:25,843; ;And the same would hold true if I do a report immediately, I can save it somewhere out on the network.
72; ;00:07:25,843 --> 00:07:37,717; ;As we said, the Reports viewer displays reports that have been created automatically based on what we just set up in the Automated Reports section.
73; ;00:07:37,717 --> 00:07:42,766; ;This allows the user to view automated reports for all the systems.
74; ;00:07:42,766 --> 00:07:48,799; ;Once a report is open, the administrator can select from the tabs to view different parts of the report.
75; ;00:07:48,799 --> 00:07:50,276; ;And we'll look at that in a minute.
76; ;00:07:50,276 --> 00:07:56,298; ;But notice the timing on these Storage Centers it's right around midnight.
77; ;00:07:56,298 --> 00:08:10,537; ;So there's a daily at 11:55, there's a weekly 12:03am, 11:55pm, there is a daily about midnight, almost straight up midnight, another weekly one.
78; ;00:08:10,537 --> 00:08:13,713; ;And these were all on SC 14.
79; ;00:08:13,713 --> 00:08:17,484; ;SC 18 same at 11:55, 12:03.
80; ;00:08:17,484 --> 00:08:32,291; ;These times are predefined internally and the idea is that they could be run at when there's least amount of activity going on in the system.
81; ;00:08:32,291 --> 00:08:39,992; ;Under the Sub Reports here, you will see the different types of reports that can be generated.
82; ;00:08:39,992 --> 00:08:43,630; ;And actually, if I go to the next slide, you'll able to see that little bit easier.
83; ;00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:45,387; ;I'll do that from here.
84; ;00:08:45,387 --> 00:08:47,461; ;This shows four of the six.
85; ;00:08:47,461 --> 00:08:49,985; ;Let's just kind of detail these.
86; ;00:08:49,985 --> 00:08:59,156; ;The Storage Center Summary Report displays the storage summary for the system.
87; ;00:08:59,156 --> 00:09:07,808; ;The Volume Storage, that will display a summary of the storage usage for each volume in the system.
88; ;00:09:07,808 --> 00:09:16,857; ;Disk Class displays the amount of space available for each disk class in the system as well as the overall disk space available.
89; ;00:09:16,857 --> 00:09:24,276; ;And then Replications display a summary of each volume that is being replicated including its progress.
90; ;00:09:24,276 --> 00:09:31,370; ;The other two that aren't on this list that we don't see in this display are Alerts, which displays current alerts in the system.
91; ;00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:40,983; ;And then if licensed, you'd get a Chargeback Report, which saves all the chargeback data or just Chargeback savings data if that's preferred.
92; ;00:09:40,983 --> 00:09:43,870; ;Let's talk about how to view a specific report then.
93; ;00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:48,674; ;From here I'm in the Reports viewer is where I'm starting.
94; ;00:09:48,674 --> 00:09:56,990; ;The difference that I'm doing here to be able to get this display is I choose- I want to look at a particular report that was generated.
95; ;00:09:56,990 --> 00:10:01,091; ;In my case here, I want to look at a monthly report.
96; ;00:10:01,091 --> 00:10:04,413; ;And these are the options that I have for that monthly report.
97; ;00:10:04,413 --> 00:10:07,676; ;The Storage Center Summary, this is what I'm getting here.
98; ;00:10:07,676 --> 00:10:15,587; ;This summarizes that information from this particular monthly report at this particular time.
99; ;00:10:15,587 --> 00:10:24,183; ;So I'm getting the details of the system summary for that monthly report that was automatically generated.
100; ;00:10:24,183 --> 00:10:31,539; ;I have the functionality from right within here to print the report or I can save it.
101; ;00:10:31,539 --> 00:10:34,308; ;Choose one or the other, I can do that.
102; ;00:10:34,308 --> 00:10:40,324; ;Now if I elect to see something other than the Storage Center Summary, what if I want to see the Volume Storage?
103; ;00:10:40,324 --> 00:10:46,672; ;As we know on this monthly report, we've also got a Volume Storage Report.
104; ;00:10:46,672 --> 00:10:55,690; ;And so I click on Volume Storage tab and I get this report here, which of course I could do the same thing, I could save it or I could print it.
105; ;00:10:55,690 --> 00:11:01,048; ;And the same thing holds true for Disk Class and Replications.
106; ;00:11:01,048 --> 00:11:11,480; ;And then certainly for more details on this, refer to the Dell Storage Manager administrator's guide to dig down deeper into the different reports.
107; ;00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:20,248; ;Threshold Alerts within DSM is a utility that lets an administrator set a predefined limit for Storage Center objects.
108; ;00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:31,440; ;So if the value limit for that object is reached, the Data Collector notifies the administrator either with an email or displaying that notification in an Alerts tab.
109; ;00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:35,660; ;It just kind of depends how the Threshold Alert is configured.
110; ;00:11:35,669 --> 00:11:44,537; ;Using Threshold Alerts consists of defining the threshold and applying it to all Storage Center systems or system components.
111; ;00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:51,725; ;Threshold alerts consists of threshold definitions and threshold queries.
112; ;00:11:51,725 --> 00:11:58,698; ;A threshold definition sets a user limit on one or more storage objects as we just talked about.
113; ;00:11:58,698 --> 00:12:07,031; ;Definitions can be run on the Storage Center during set times for monitoring systems and sending out alerts.
114; ;00:12:07,031 --> 00:12:10,335; ;Once a threshold is found, it is stored.
115; ;00:12:10,335 --> 00:12:18,042; ;And that's where the threshold manager sends emails out to all users configured to receive those email alerts.
116; ;00:12:18,042 --> 00:12:21,140; ;Threshold queries are a little different.
117; ;00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:31,588; ;You want a threshold query on IO Usage or Storage or Replications, the big difference though is threshold queries are run on demand.
118; ;00:12:31,588 --> 00:12:37,920; ;So there's no set monitoring schedule and the query and the query results can be saved.
119; ;00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:41,209; ;Where do I create threshold definitions?
120; ;00:12:41,209 --> 00:12:43,564; ;There are a couple different places to do it.
121; ;00:12:43,564 --> 00:12:46,961; ;But one of them is here from the Threshold Alerts location.
122; ;00:12:46,961 --> 00:12:51,971; ;I'm under Definitions, and it's right here: Create Threshold Definition.
123; ;00:12:51,971 --> 00:12:53,626; ;I can do it right from there.
124; ;00:12:53,626 --> 00:12:58,501; ;As I said, there's a few other locations in the DSM interface where you can do the same.
125; ;00:12:58,501 --> 00:13:03,004; ;And you see that here, Definitions and Create Threshold Definition.
126; ;00:13:03,004 --> 00:13:16,140; ;It's a good idea before Creating Threshold Definitions to view historical reporting data on a system-by-system basis, just to determine which thresholds really need to be monitored.
127; ;00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:25,585; ;As you might guess, this would require to have a Storage Center for a while, probably for a period of six months or so, maybe a little less depending how active it is.
128; ;00:13:25,585 --> 00:13:30,806; ;But before you get a comfort level with how you should be setting up these definitions.
129; ;00:13:30,806 --> 00:13:39,430; ;As we said, you want to select Threshold Alerts, click the Definitions tab, and then Create Threshold Definitions is where you want to go next.
130; ;00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:46,544; ;You'll give your threshold definition a name, Volume IO pending threshold in this case.
131; ;00:13:46,544 --> 00:13:51,392; ;The different types, you have IO Usage, Storage, or Replication.
132; ;00:13:51,392 --> 00:13:58,262; ;IO Usage, you see there is the default, but you could also do it by Storage.
133; ;00:13:58,262 --> 00:14:02,923; ;Or if you're doing a lot of Replications, that's another way to do it.
134; ;00:14:02,923 --> 00:14:16,628; ;Under the Alert Object Type, these are all the things I can get alerts on: the Storage Center, an individual Volume, which is the default, a Server, Disk, Disk Class, Controller, Controller Port, or Storage Profile.
135; ;00:14:16,628 --> 00:14:23,390; ;You can see, you can really dig deep into what you want to get thresholds on.
136; ;00:14:23,390 --> 00:14:35,405; ;If you're trying to analyze if there's a certain controller that is having an issue, in this case from a latency standpoint, maybe it's a Controller Port, you've got it narrowed down to that being the bottleneck.
137; ;00:14:35,405 --> 00:14:41,887; ;So you can really, you know, dig in and really find out what's going on.
138; ;00:14:41,887 --> 00:14:45,515; ;The third one there is the Alert Definition.
139; ;00:14:45,515 --> 00:14:53,164; ;You can do it by IOs per second, kilobytes per second, latency, or IOs pending.
140; ;00:14:53,164 --> 00:14:54,867; ;This one is a great one.
141; ;00:14:54,867 --> 00:15:00,191; ;What we're really looking for here, is what kind of latency are we getting.
142; ;00:15:00,191 --> 00:15:03,723; ;What kind of latency are we getting on a particular volume?
143; ;00:15:03,723 --> 00:15:09,287; ;That's what we're going to analyze here by this particular threshold definition.
144; ;00:15:09,287 --> 00:15:16,479; ;A user can set the Notification Settings for an error, a warning, or informational.
145; ;00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:22,490; ;So depending on how many IOs pending, in other words, what kind of latency are we seeing.
146; ;00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:24,524; ;How many IOs are being stacked up?
147; ;00:15:24,524 --> 00:15:27,154; ;I could put the number of IOs here.
148; ;00:15:27,154 --> 00:15:31,931; ;And the higher that IO, the more likely it would generate an error.
149; ;00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:52,906; ;The more IOs that are pending, I want to get an email on those when that occurs maybe one time if I have, I don't know, 10 IOs, 20 IOs sitting stacked, I may want to get an email when that happens one time, maybe if I have five for informational settings.
150; ;00:15:52,906 --> 00:15:58,734; ;If I've 5 IOs, 10 IOs, something like that, some fairly small number.
151; ;00:15:58,734 --> 00:16:01,459; ;I may not even care if I get an email on that.
152; ;00:16:01,459 --> 00:16:04,722; ;That's the idea with information, warnings, and errors.
153; ;00:16:04,722 --> 00:16:11,128; ;It just sort of depends on what we've got pending in this particular case.
154; ;00:16:11,128 --> 00:16:14,521; ;Now there's multiple different ways as you can tell to run this.
155; ;00:16:14,521 --> 00:16:19,459; ;This happens to be an IO pending one, but it could be more than that.
156; ;00:16:19,459 --> 00:16:23,375; ;Notice that you can enable the Schedule Settings.
157; ;00:16:23,375 --> 00:16:29,526; ;The default is like 8:00 to 5:00 every day.
158; ;00:16:29,526 --> 00:16:32,941; ;So you can narrow that down to Monday to Friday.
159; ;00:16:32,941 --> 00:16:40,864; ;Or obviously, you can narrow this, pinpoint it down to when users first come in the morning, they first start logging in.
160; ;00:16:40,864 --> 00:16:44,064; ;Then what are we seeing for IOs pending.
161; ;00:16:44,064 --> 00:16:50,115; ;It might be, you know, 7am to 9am, Monday through Friday for example.
162; ;00:16:50,115 --> 00:16:52,200; ;Maybe it's over the lunch hour.
163; ;00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:55,275; ;All right, 11am to 1pm, or what have you.
164; ;00:16:55,275 --> 00:17:00,265; ;Any of these things can be set up as threshold definitions.
165; ;00:17:00,265 --> 00:17:06,647; ;Remember, when you set up these threshold definitions, these definitions are always running.
166; ;00:17:06,647 --> 00:17:13,033; ;Whenever we hit that threshold, that's when I get an email or that's when an alert is generated.
167; ;00:17:13,033 --> 00:17:20,707; ;Once I set up that definition, it's always out there, unless I either change the definition or delete it entirely.
168; ;00:17:20,707 --> 00:17:26,169; ;Threshold queries can be defined by the user to quickly check for issues.
169; ;00:17:26,169 --> 00:17:33,414; ;Just like definitions, queries can be created for IO Usage, Storage, and Replication.
170; ;00:17:33,414 --> 00:17:37,086; ;The big thing with queries is they're run on demand by the user.
171; ;00:17:37,086 --> 00:17:41,060; ;But those can be saved for future use.
172; ;00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:46,430; ;You see over here on the left, there is Public and Personal Queries.
173; ;00:17:46,430 --> 00:17:52,451; ;When you're saving a query, the user can choose to save it for private use or for public use.
174; ;00:17:52,451 --> 00:17:58,380; ;If it's saved for public use, any user logging into Dell Storage Manager can run the query.
175; ;00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:05,989; ;To create a threshold query, select the Threshold Alerts viewer, click the Queries tab, right up here.
176; ;00:18:05,989 --> 00:18:15,871; ;Under the Save Query Filter Values, give that query a name if you're intending to save that to run this again in a future time.
177; ;00:18:15,871 --> 00:18:21,670; ;You can check Public if you want it made available to all DSM users.
178; ;00:18:21,670 --> 00:18:26,788; ;Or if you don't click Public, it will become a personal query.
179; ;00:18:26,788 --> 00:18:34,224; ;Under the Query Filter sections, you can do All Storage Centers or you can pick an individual Storage Center that you want to run this query against.
180; ;00:18:34,224 --> 00:18:39,720; ;You have a Definition, you have the Storage Object, and you have the Definition options.
181; ;00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:45,405; ;These are the same options that we just saw, when we set up the threshold definition.
182; ;00:18:45,405 --> 00:18:47,140; ;I have a start time.
183; ;00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:52,130; ;This query is an on demand threshold.
184; ;00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:57,290; ;So I can put last hour and when do I want to start and what time.
185; ;00:18:57,290 --> 00:19:12,060; ;And then I can put a Threshold Value, depending on what my definition is, I can put that value and if I want alerts to occur as in do I want to get an email on this or do I want a threshold alert to be generated.
186; ;00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:19,429; ;Once I've got everything set up, I then go ahead and hit the Run key or the Run button here.
187; ;00:19:19,429 --> 00:19:24,791; ;And I will get some results based on the information I put in up here.
188; ;00:19:24,791 --> 00:19:30,229; ;The neat thing about this is I can save these results as well.
189; ;00:19:30,229 --> 00:19:31,816; ;Click on Save Results.
190; ;00:19:31,816 --> 00:19:36,345; ;I have these six ways of saving this output.
191; ;00:19:36,345 --> 00:19:39,508; ;Here, I put it again local, but you can see where I put it.
192; ;00:19:39,508 --> 00:19:41,586; ;We called it IO query.
193; ;00:19:41,586 --> 00:19:46,639; ;And this is a new one, IO query, and we created a PDF file.
194; ;00:19:46,639 --> 00:19:48,303; ;So I could save it.
195; ;00:19:48,303 --> 00:19:49,608; ;Remember, I'm saving it.
196; ;00:19:49,608 --> 00:19:52,638; ;This would save out in the Public Query section.
197; ;00:19:52,638 --> 00:19:57,012; ;So any DSM user could go ahead and look at it if they wanted to.
198; ;00:19:57,012 --> 00:20:04,458; ;Keep in mind then the threshold queries only run on demand.
199; ;00:20:04,458 --> 00:20:12,363; ;The Threshold Alerts viewer displays alerts generated by threshold queries and definitions under the Alerts tab.
200; ;00:20:12,363 --> 00:20:18,360; ;From the Threshold Alerts viewer, I just highlight the Alerts tab there.
201; ;00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:30,670; ;And notice, this will show me the alerts, but if I just want to see what definitions I've got set up or what threshold queries I've got saved, I can look at that here.
202; ;00:20:30,670 --> 00:20:34,445; ;But in this case, I want to take a look at the threshold alerts that have been generated.
203; ;00:20:34,445 --> 00:20:36,056; ;So I just click on the Alert tab.
204; ;00:20:36,056 --> 00:20:38,759; ;I've got two different alerts here.
205; ;00:20:38,759 --> 00:20:43,625; ;I've got Current Threshold Alerts, and I've got Historical Threshold Alerts.
206; ;00:20:43,625 --> 00:20:55,607; ;The Current Threshold Alerts are for Storage Center objects that exceeded their assigned threshold definition the last time Threshold Alerts were run.
207; ;00:20:55,607 --> 00:21:03,473; ;If a component is currently above a threshold definition, the component is displayed up here in the Current Threshold Alerts.
208; ;00:21:03,473 --> 00:21:15,777; ;If a component was above a threshold definition at one point but no longer is now, it is moved down here to the Historical Threshold Alerts section.
209; ;00:21:15,777 --> 00:21:23,376; ;Either one of these, any one of these Current Threshold Alerts or Historical Threshold Alerts can be saved.
210; ;00:21:23,376 --> 00:21:25,601; ;There's that little floppy disk icon again.
211; ;00:21:25,601 --> 00:21:29,924; ;They can be saved to either of the six formats, okay?
212; ;00:21:29,924 --> 00:21:32,868; ;This gives a refresh.
213; ;00:21:32,868 --> 00:21:45,830; ;If I've recently looked at the alerts, let's say I just ran a query and I wanted to check an alert, I can do a refresh there and this screen will be refreshed and updated with the most current information.
214; ;00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:50,985; ;It's time for a few review questions here to test your knowledge of what we just covered.
215; ;00:21:50,985 --> 00:21:55,002; ;With what frequency can reports be automatically generated?
216; ;00:21:55,002 --> 00:21:57,208; ;Remember that one?
217; ;00:21:57,208 --> 00:22:00,598; ;Yeah, daily, weekly, or monthly.
218; ;00:22:00,598 --> 00:22:02,845; ;Good.
219; ;00:22:02,845 --> 00:22:06,927; ;What type of threshold alert is run on demand?
220; ;00:22:06,927 --> 00:22:08,395; ;Remember that one?
221; ;00:22:08,395 --> 00:22:10,254; ;Yeah, threshold query.
222; ;00:22:10,254 --> 00:22:11,589; ;Good.
223; ;00:22:11,589 --> 00:22:13,336; ;And then the third one, true or false.
224; ;00:22:13,336 --> 00:22:19,035; ;Automated reports can be attached to an email once they've been generated.
225; ;00:22:19,035 --> 00:22:21,023; ;And indeed that is true.
1; ;00:00:01,631 --> 00:00:03,638; ;Here's a discussion question for us.
2; ;00:00:03,638 --> 00:00:07,473; ;Name the two types of Data Progression used in SC Series array?
3; ;00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:11,445; ;You probably know that one already.
4; ;00:00:11,445 --> 00:00:17,194; ;We've got the traditional Data Progression and On-demand Data Progression.
5; ;00:00:17,194 --> 00:00:27,503; ;In the next few slides, we're just going to talk about the difference between the two and try to point out some of the things that do make them different.
6; ;00:00:27,503 --> 00:00:36,411; ;Let's look at Data Progression, and particularly looking at the differences between traditional Data Progression and On-demand Data Progression.
7; ;00:00:36,411 --> 00:00:40,767; ;We'll start with, we'll look at traditional Data Progression.
8; ;00:00:40,767 --> 00:00:55,917; ;What Data Progression does, it leverages costs and performance differences between types of drives, between storage tiers, allowing the maximum use of lower-cost, high-capacity SAS drives.
9; ;00:00:55,917 --> 00:01:10,613; ;Typically, they're going to be in tier 3 for stored data, while maintaining performance oriented drives, that's going to be in tier 1, SSDs typically, could be 15K drives for frequently accessed data.
10; ;00:01:10,613 --> 00:01:22,647; ;Data Progression takes advantage of this by automatically tracking block usage and migrating data between tiers based on Storage Profiles.
11; ;00:01:22,647 --> 00:01:25,240; ;And here are the Storage Profiles here.
12; ;00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:28,892; ;As we have said, the recommended profile, that's the default.
13; ;00:01:28,892 --> 00:01:31,703; ;This optimizes Data Progression across all tiers.
14; ;00:01:31,703 --> 00:01:35,837; ;So most of our customers will use that recommended Data Progression.
15; ;00:01:38,035 --> 00:01:50,302; ;The other options for system-defined Storage Profiles are you can pin a volume into tier 1, tier 2, or tier 3 by choosing high priority, medium priority, or low priority.
16; ;00:01:50,302 --> 00:01:59,177; ;Keep in mind though that if you say I want a particular volume to always be in tier 3, low priority.
17; ;00:01:59,177 --> 00:02:05,664; ;That means that it won't ever move out of tier 3 unless you change its Storage Profile.
18; ;00:02:05,664 --> 00:02:18,941; ;That volume will remain in tier 3 even as that volume starts getting used more and some pages are used more often where you might want to have it move up to faster storage, it won't.
19; ;00:02:18,941 --> 00:02:23,884; ;It will always remain in tier 3 and the same with tier 1 or tier 2.
20; ;00:02:23,884 --> 00:02:35,381; ;If you choose those Storage Profiles, that volume will always remain in that tier unless you change the Storage Profile for that volume.
21; ;00:02:35,381 --> 00:02:46,872; ;Here's the interface in the Dell Storage Manager client that shows the four different system-defined Storage Profiles from recommended to low priority.
22; ;00:02:46,872 --> 00:02:50,263; ;You can also create a Storage Profile.
23; ;00:02:50,263 --> 00:02:55,165; ;At any point, you can create a user-defined profile.
24; ;00:02:55,165 --> 00:02:57,644; ;This one shows tier 3 Storage Profile.
25; ;00:02:57,644 --> 00:03:05,485; ;But you can create any new profile you want from within the DSM interface from the screen.
26; ;00:03:05,485 --> 00:03:13,333; ;Keep in mind, traditional Data Progression runs on all SC Series systems that are not considered flash-optimized.
27; ;00:03:13,333 --> 00:03:16,694; ;So that's going to be a lot of systems.
28; ;00:03:16,694 --> 00:03:19,195; ;Most of our systems are not flash-optimized.
29; ;00:03:19,195 --> 00:03:22,490; ;The only exception to that is SCv2000.
30; ;00:03:22,490 --> 00:03:28,565; ;And SCv2000, their Storage Profiles, we'll talk about in the next slide.
31; ;00:03:28,565 --> 00:03:44,164; ;Remember that systems in the SCv2000 family are all single tier, so therefore we use the functionality referred to as RAID tiering to move data between RAID 10 and RAID 5 or RAID 6 in a single tier.
32; ;00:03:44,164 --> 00:03:49,729; ;It does not move data between tiers because, there's only one tier that's available.
33; ;00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:54,803; ;Because of that, there's no flexibility to add another Storage Profile.
34; ;00:03:54,803 --> 00:04:06,214; ;So the three Storage Profiles that you see here - Balanced, Maximum Efficiency, and Maximized Performance - those are the ones that system that customers will use.
35; ;00:04:06,214 --> 00:04:08,373; ;Let's take a quick look at each of those.
36; ;00:04:08,373 --> 00:04:15,592; ;With balanced, it balances efficiency and performance for any volume using that Storage Profile.
37; ;00:04:15,592 --> 00:04:20,419; ;This tells you what happens with the balanced profile.
38; ;00:04:21,912 --> 00:04:26,035; ;All writes go to tier 1, RAID 10.
39; ;00:04:26,035 --> 00:04:32,709; ;When snapshots are taken, they're taken in tier 1 because of course that's the only tier we've got.
40; ;00:04:32,709 --> 00:04:41,210; ;And then those volumes, those pages are moved to RAID 5 and 6, so this is going to improve the amount of space that we've got.
41; ;00:04:43,421 --> 00:04:46,447; ;The next type is Maximize Efficiency.
42; ;00:04:46,447 --> 00:04:56,537; ;Maximize Efficiency, it writes new data to RAID 5 or RAID 6 and it keeps that snapshot data in RAID 5 or RAID 6 as well.
43; ;00:04:56,537 --> 00:05:03,811; ;It's great for volumes with less important data or infrequently used data, that would be Maximize Efficiency.
44; ;00:05:03,811 --> 00:05:16,341; ;And then finally Maximize Performance, it's going to write new data into tier 10 and take snapshots -excuse me, into tier 1 - and it's going to take snapshots on RAID 10.
45; ;00:05:16,341 --> 00:05:18,823; ;This is going to increase performance.
46; ;00:05:18,823 --> 00:05:32,608; ;It's going to take up more space, but those volumes that have the Maximize Performance Storage Profile will have indeed better performance than either Balanced or Maximize Efficiency.
47; ;00:05:32,608 --> 00:05:37,541; ;We mentioned the flash-optimized solution a couple of times in this module.
48; ;00:05:37,541 --> 00:05:54,687; ;Remember, the flash-optimized solution is one where I've got write-intensive SSDs in tier 1, read-intensive SSDs in tier 2, and then 7.2K spinning drives in tier 3.
49; ;00:05:54,687 --> 00:06:01,134; ;If I've got that scenario, I have a flash-optimized solution.
50; ;00:06:01,134 --> 00:06:12,145; ;The flash-optimized solution came out, I want to say late 2014 with version 6.4.
51; ;00:06:12,145 --> 00:06:24,808; ;The key part of this is we wanted to make sure that we weren't filling up these write-intensive SSD drives because, of course, they're very expensive and they're not very big.
52; ;00:06:24,808 --> 00:06:30,858; ;The idea was that we wanted to make sure we weren't filling up tier 1.
53; ;00:06:30,858 --> 00:06:34,975; ;We wanted to keep that available space for new writes as much as possible.
54; ;00:06:34,975 --> 00:06:49,947; ;So that's the idea with On-demand Data Progression because with On-demand Data Progression what happens is as soon as a snapshot is taken, On-demand Data Progression will run.
55; ;00:06:49,947 --> 00:06:57,054; ;And when that On-demand Data Progression runs, it moves those pages from tier 1 down to tier 2.
56; ;00:06:57,054 --> 00:07:03,611; ;There's no waiting until like 7pm as the traditional Data Progression works.
57; ;00:07:03,611 --> 00:07:09,795; ;On-demand Data Progression works as soon as a snapshot is taken.
58; ;00:07:09,795 --> 00:07:15,769; ;On-demand Data Progression also produced a new type of snapshot.
59; ;00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:19,331; ;And this type of snapshot is called a space management snapshot.
60; ;00:07:19,331 --> 00:07:30,839; ;The idea is that if tier 1 is 95% full, the system itself, the software is going to take that space management snapshot.
61; ;00:07:30,839 --> 00:07:37,617; ;And the whole idea is that we want to make sure there's room on those write-intensive SSDs.
62; ;00:07:37,617 --> 00:07:51,422; ;It'll take that space management snapshot and then after the space management snapshot is taken, then of course the On-demand Data Progression runs and pages are moved from tier 1 to tier 2.
63; ;00:07:51,422 --> 00:07:55,889; ;So keep in mind those space management snapshots are not mountable.
64; ;00:07:55,889 --> 00:08:04,021; ;The only purpose of those is to free up the space in the tier 1 write-intensive SSD.
65; ;00:08:04,021 --> 00:08:10,859; ;With the introduction of On-demand Data Progression, it meant more Storage Profiles had to be made available.
66; ;00:08:10,859 --> 00:08:16,487; ;The original Storage Profiles were not going to work, the traditional Storage Profiles.
67; ;00:08:16,487 --> 00:08:25,866; ;So the engineers developed a series of profiles, five storage profiles that are used in a flash-optimized solution.
68; ;00:08:25,866 --> 00:08:29,597; ;So we're going to kind of review each of those now starting with the first one.
69; ;00:08:29,597 --> 00:08:31,641; ;Flash Only with Progression.
70; ;00:08:31,641 --> 00:08:39,456; ;The idea here is that new writes are going to come in to RAID 10 on those write-intensive SSDs.
71; ;00:08:39,456 --> 00:08:49,870; ;Once a snapshot is taken, then On-demand Data Progression runs and those pages will move down to tier 2 but they won't go any further down than that.
72; ;00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:53,075; ;So they'll always remain on flash.
73; ;00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:57,222; ;The next one is Flash-optimized with Progression.
74; ;00:08:57,222 --> 00:09:00,017; ;And this is actually the default.
75; ;00:09:00,017 --> 00:09:14,768; ;What happens here is I'm writing into tier 1, those write-intensive SSDs to RAID 10, when we do a snapshot then On-demand Data Progression moves into tier 2.
76; ;00:09:14,768 --> 00:09:22,913; ;And then at that point, the traditional nightly progression will run.
77; ;00:09:22,913 --> 00:09:28,459; ;And at that point, it will potentially move those pages down to tier 3.
78; ;00:09:28,459 --> 00:09:39,572; ;This provides the most efficient storage for enclosures containing both read-intensive and write-intensive as well as spinning media.
79; ;00:09:39,572 --> 00:09:42,723; ;The next one then is Low Priority.
80; ;00:09:42,723 --> 00:09:49,604; ;And with low priority, those volumes are going to be pinned to tier 3 and they're not going to move out of tier 3.
81; ;00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:57,960; ;They're going to be on the spinning disk, typically the 7.5K RPM drives.
82; ;00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:00,529; ;Next one is Low Priority with Progression.
83; ;00:10:00,529 --> 00:10:05,936; ;So here, you're starting that volume in tier 3.
84; ;00:10:05,936 --> 00:10:14,339; ;However, if performance warrants, it will migrate those pages up to tier 2.
85; ;00:10:14,339 --> 00:10:18,460; ;Notice that it won't go up to tier 1 with Low Priority with Progression.
86; ;00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:21,948; ;It will remain in tier 2.
87; ;00:10:21,948 --> 00:10:29,716; ;So we're still saving those tier 1 spaces for what we consider the highest priority volumes.
88; ;00:10:29,716 --> 00:10:33,042; ;And then the fifth one is write-intensive, or tier 1.
89; ;00:10:33,042 --> 00:10:37,617; ;Here writes go into tier 1, those write-intensive drives.
90; ;00:10:37,617 --> 00:10:45,020; ;Snapshots are taken, they're actually kept in tier 1 at RAID 10 as well, and data remains in tier 1.
91; ;00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:53,454; ;These are things that are useful for storing things like transaction logs and temporary database files that are continually being replenished.
92; ;00:10:53,454 --> 00:10:58,558; ;We want the performance, we don't necessarily need the snapshots.
93; ;00:10:58,558 --> 00:11:03,955; ;So it perhaps doesn't sound quite as... Or isn't quite as bad as it might sound.
94; ;00:11:05,142 --> 00:11:09,584; ;Let's wrap up this module then by looking at a couple more review questions.
95; ;00:11:09,584 --> 00:11:16,031; ;The first one, what type of Data Progression is used with an SC Series Flash-optimized solution?
96; ;00:11:16,031 --> 00:11:17,459; ;We just talked about that.
97; ;00:11:17,459 --> 00:11:19,350; ;Yep, On-demand Data Progression.
98; ;00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:27,701; ;In an SCv2000, what Storage Profile always keeps data in RAID 10 to increase performance?
99; ;00:11:29,446 --> 00:11:31,862; ;I'm going to give you the answer there, it's part of the question.
100; ;00:11:31,862 --> 00:11:34,002; ;Maximize Performance.
101; ;00:11:34,002 --> 00:11:37,297; ;Remember, that's a Storage Profile on an SCv2000.
102; ;00:11:37,297 --> 00:11:50,453; ;And finally, true or false, with traditional Data Progression if a volume has a tier 1 Storage Profile, it will move data to tier 3 based on inactivity for that volume.
103; ;00:11:50,453 --> 00:11:51,689; ;Is that true or false?
104; ;00:11:53,323 --> 00:11:54,365; ;False.
105; ;00:11:54,365 --> 00:11:57,215; ;Remember, it will always stay in tier 1.
106; ;00:11:57,215 --> 00:12:06,099; ;So if you set up a volume to be in the tier 1 Storage Profile, it will always stay in tier 1, it will not move down to any other tier.
1; ;00:00:02,608 --> 00:00:06,339; ;A discussion question, kind of a prelude for things to come.
2; ;00:00:06,339 --> 00:00:13,961; ;What tool in the SC Series helps fine tune Data Progression by setting up rules to assist in placing the data?
3; ;00:00:15,017 --> 00:00:17,171; ;And we kind of gave you some hints on that earlier.
4; ;00:00:19,957 --> 00:00:21,848; ;Storage profile.
5; ;00:00:21,848 --> 00:00:23,145; ;Yeah, good.
6; ;00:00:23,145 --> 00:00:24,889; ;Storage profile.
7; ;00:00:24,889 --> 00:00:35,133; ;Here we're going to talk about Storage Center snapshot and Data Progression management and how storage profiles come into that whole equation.
8; ;00:00:37,391 --> 00:00:50,511; ;This slide is gonna kind of build out and it's going to really emphasize and show you the symmetry, I would say, between Data Progression and snapshots, and how they have to work together.
9; ;00:00:50,511 --> 00:01:00,666; ;This slide is gonna kind of build on itself to help you kind of recognize the connection between the two.
10; ;00:01:00,666 --> 00:01:05,998; ;In our scenario here, we've got a performance tier and a capacity tier.
11; ;00:01:05,998 --> 00:01:19,711; ;And as we said this earlier that most of our customers today have two tiers, tier 1 and tier 3, and we're kind of lumping tier 1 and 2 together as a performance tier, but kind of looking at it as two tiers.
12; ;00:01:19,711 --> 00:01:26,115; ;This is our timeline to kind of give an idea of how things are happening.
13; ;00:01:26,115 --> 00:01:29,084; ;Let's kind of walk through it here.
14; ;00:01:29,084 --> 00:01:37,188; ;Remember, data is initially written as we talked about it, writes data RAID 10 to the fastest tier in the array.
15; ;00:01:37,188 --> 00:01:43,978; ;That's gonna be the performance tier, typically RAID 10 into Tier 1 SSDs probably.
16; ;00:01:43,978 --> 00:01:50,986; ;It could be 15K drive if it's all spinning disk, but those are RAID 10 written to the fastest drives.
17; ;00:01:50,986 --> 00:01:53,056; ;Then a snapshot is taken.
18; ;00:01:53,056 --> 00:01:59,796; ;When that snapshot is taken, remember those pages are marked as accessible read only.
19; ;00:01:59,796 --> 00:02:09,187; ;They remain in RAID 10, but those pages can no longer be changed, remember, they're frozen and labeled as accessible read only.
20; ;00:02:09,187 --> 00:02:10,894; ;But still in RAID 10.
21; ;00:02:10,894 --> 00:02:17,811; ;Data Progression runs, On-Demand Data Progression will run right after that.
22; ;00:02:17,811 --> 00:02:21,171; ;Remember, a snapshot will trigger On-Demand Data Progression.
23; ;00:02:21,171 --> 00:02:27,289; ;When that happens, those pages are then moved into RAID 5.
24; ;00:02:27,289 --> 00:02:32,908; ;So they're still accessible read only because they were frozen by the snapshot.
25; ;00:02:32,908 --> 00:02:37,593; ;Data Progression runs and it moves to RAID 5.
26; ;00:02:37,593 --> 00:02:44,334; ;You're freeing up some space right there in tier 1 by going from RAID 10 to RAID 5.
27; ;00:02:45,936 --> 00:02:55,298; ;Now new data obviously, things keep happening, I'm writing new data, so a new page is created, RAID 10.
28; ;00:02:55,298 --> 00:03:05,018; ;I've got C1 it was referred to as, notice what happens then to page C, okay?
29; ;00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:25,774; ;The next Data Progression that happens that is considered an inaccessible read only page and it will get moved immediately down to tier 3, it's a capacity tier in this case, and it will be RAID 6.
30; ;00:03:25,774 --> 00:03:39,386; ;That's an inaccessible page and as soon as Data Progression runs, that's moved down to tier 3, so there is no waiting 12 days, whatever the case is.
31; ;00:03:39,386 --> 00:03:46,303; ;As soon as it's inaccessible read only it gets moved down to tier 3 the next time Data Progression runs.
32; ;00:03:48,465 --> 00:03:56,956; ;Now you'll see page B shows as aged data.
33; ;00:03:56,956 --> 00:04:09,728; ;Again, looking at how this would work, that could be 12 days, so that page hasn't changed within 12 days, or to be more accurate, 12 Data Progression cycles.
34; ;00:04:09,728 --> 00:04:16,067; ;And Data Progression will run, the scheduled Data Progression runs every day at a certain time, right?
35; ;00:04:16,067 --> 00:04:30,666; ;These are going to, say 12 runs of Data Progression happen, when that occurs after 12 days that page B will move down to tier 3, and it's considered...
36; ;00:04:30,666 --> 00:04:37,232; ;It's a read only page and it will move down to tier 3 and be in RAID 6.
37; ;00:04:37,232 --> 00:04:51,496; ;Obviously this is conceptual in nature, in reality the data layout is gonna be a whole lot more complex, but we want to give you this to give you an idea of really how Data Progression and snapshots work together.
38; ;00:04:53,741 --> 00:04:57,500; ;What's involved with managing snapshots?
39; ;00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:02,331; ;And in our case the Data Instant Replay feature in the SC Series.
40; ;00:05:02,331 --> 00:05:13,848; ;You can see physically where you can view those as you go into the Dell Storage Manager under the Storage tab - I'm highlighting a volume that I've got created.
41; ;00:05:13,848 --> 00:05:29,275; ;And then under Snapshots you see a list of all the snapshots, you'll have the expiration time, the size, the space recovery, and they have been coalesced, and what percentage is it actually taking up.
42; ;00:05:29,275 --> 00:05:32,674; ;You see all that in the Dell Storage Manager.
43; ;00:05:32,674 --> 00:05:37,430; ;A couple of things to think about, how often should snapshots be scheduled?
44; ;00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:47,933; ;Really what you wanna do is to determine the Recovery Point Objective for each volume, or at least the most critical volumes that you wanna make sure you have snapshots of.
45; ;00:05:47,933 --> 00:06:02,232; ;The Recovery Point Objective, the RPO, is defined as the age of files that must be recovered from backup in order for normal operations to resume after a data loss or a service outage.
46; ;00:06:02,232 --> 00:06:10,491; ;If it's critical data, a database for example, you probably want to be, a half hour, perhaps even 15 minutes.
47; ;00:06:10,491 --> 00:06:19,443; ;You can't afford to be much more behind than that, so you might take a snapshot every 15 minutes for those critical volumes.
48; ;00:06:19,443 --> 00:06:28,715; ;File volume, for example, that might be something that once a day will be fine which is not accessed to all that often.
49; ;00:06:30,544 --> 00:06:37,812; ;As far as expiration goes, we talked about that expiration has to occur.
50; ;00:06:37,812 --> 00:06:42,069; ;Every setup that you have has an expiration date.
51; ;00:06:42,069 --> 00:06:45,075; ;So you want to expire snapshots that are no longer useful.
52; ;00:06:45,075 --> 00:06:48,125; ;Obviously it's going to free up storage.
53; ;00:06:48,125 --> 00:06:53,928; ;When views are no longer needed, make sure you unmap and then delete them.
54; ;00:06:55,155 --> 00:07:00,856; ;As we said snapshots can occur automatically, they can also be done any time On-Demand.
55; ;00:07:00,856 --> 00:07:09,173; ;So any time a user wants to do a snapshot, you just right click the Volume and say create snapshot.
56; ;00:07:09,173 --> 00:07:19,634; ;There are few different ways that you're able to create a snapshot, and this is where you're gonna manage them within the Dell Storage Manager.
57; ;00:07:19,634 --> 00:07:24,447; ;We're gonna take a look at different storage profiles that are used in the SC Series.
58; ;00:07:24,447 --> 00:07:31,916; ;Remember, that storage profiles determine the RAID level and tiers on which data is stored.
59; ;00:07:31,916 --> 00:07:37,863; ;So if you look here, this is in the Dell Storage Manager interface, right, the DSM.
60; ;00:07:37,863 --> 00:07:40,420; ;And you see the different storage profiles.
61; ;00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:48,968; ;Now the first four you have the recommended, high priority, medium priority, and the low priority.
62; ;00:07:50,415 --> 00:07:56,812; ;As we talked about earlier, the recommended storage profile is what we typically use.
63; ;00:07:56,812 --> 00:08:07,451; ;And you'll notice how many volumes in this fictional environment, in SC25, 13 volumes are using the recommended storage profile.
64; ;00:08:07,451 --> 00:08:13,119; ;Notice that you can create a storage profile, and you see the option right here.
65; ;00:08:13,119 --> 00:08:17,613; ;You'll notice that there was a tier 3 storage profile created.
66; ;00:08:17,613 --> 00:08:24,272; ;And someone put one volume in that storage profile.
67; ;00:08:24,272 --> 00:08:30,015; ;What is the tier 3 storage profile, it says tiers used, tier 3.
68; ;00:08:30,015 --> 00:08:41,112; ;That means if I create a volume using that storage profile, the tier 3 storage profile, data will always stay in tier 3.
69; ;00:08:41,112 --> 00:08:47,885; ;And actually that's the high-priority, medium-priority, and low-priority profiles also work that way.
70; ;00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:59,680; ;If I create a new volume and I want it in the tier 1, always to stay in tier 1, I want that data to always be on the fast drives, I can do that.
71; ;00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:11,360; ;I just put it in the high priority, use the high-priority storage profile and it will always remain in tier 1 if I want to do it that way.
72; ;00:09:11,365 --> 00:09:13,848; ;This is traditional storage profiles.
73; ;00:09:13,848 --> 00:09:20,489; ;In the next couple slides, we're gonna look at a couple of other types of storage profiles depending on the solution that was purchased.
74; ;00:09:21,739 --> 00:09:28,686; ;Remember the Data Progression, as we've talked about, moves pages from one tier of storage to another.
75; ;00:09:28,686 --> 00:09:35,083; ;In an SCv2000, there is functionality referred to as RAID tiering.
76; ;00:09:35,083 --> 00:09:43,613; ;RAID tiering moves data between RAID 10 and RAID 5 or RAID 6 in a single tier.
77; ;00:09:43,613 --> 00:09:51,159; ;It does not move data between tiers since data in an SCv2000, remember, is only in tier 1.
78; ;00:09:51,159 --> 00:09:59,979; ;Because of that, we've got different storage profiles that have to be set up in an SCv2000.
79; ;00:09:59,979 --> 00:10:06,073; ;And I say have to be set up, but actually come predefined, there are really three storage profiles.
80; ;00:10:06,073 --> 00:10:07,936; ;Let's take a quick look at those.
81; ;00:10:07,936 --> 00:10:21,861; ;There's the balanced profile, and that's going to be RAID 10 Active Parity RAID Replay, kind of what we just defined, in this case here RAID 10 active, RAID 6 replay.
82; ;00:10:21,861 --> 00:10:27,595; ;This RAID tiering happens by default at 7 pm every night.
83; ;00:10:27,595 --> 00:10:34,611; ;There are three storage profiles available for SCv2000 systems.
84; ;00:10:34,611 --> 00:10:40,371; ;As we see, balanced is the first one.
85; ;00:10:40,371 --> 00:10:41,797; ;Now what does balanced mean?
86; ;00:10:41,797 --> 00:10:48,761; ;Balance balances efficiency and performance for any volume that uses that storage profile.
87; ;00:10:50,015 --> 00:10:54,645; ;When a volume uses the balanced profile, all new data is written to tier 1.
88; ;00:10:54,645 --> 00:11:03,910; ;When a snapshot is created, Data Progression moves that snapshot data from RAID 10 to RAID 5 or 6, in this case RAID 6.
89; ;00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:08,551; ;RAID 6 tiering occurs between RAID types only as we just mentioned.
90; ;00:11:09,898 --> 00:11:13,310; ;The second type is called maximum efficiency.
91; ;00:11:13,310 --> 00:11:24,303; ;What happens with this profile, it writes new data to RAID 5 or RAID 6 and it keeps snapshot data in that same RAID level - RAID 5 or 6.
92; ;00:11:24,303 --> 00:11:30,128; ;So it's useful for volumes with less important data and data that doesn't change that often.
93; ;00:11:30,128 --> 00:11:34,990; ;There is really no RAID tiering done at all with this profile.
94; ;00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:38,029; ;And then the third one is called maximum performance.
95; ;00:11:38,029 --> 00:11:43,421; ;This is for volumes that you want increased performance on.
96; ;00:11:43,421 --> 00:11:50,796; ;It's useful for volumes that are critical volumes and/or volumes that frequently change.
97; ;00:11:50,796 --> 00:11:54,904; ;It's data that's used a lot.
98; ;00:11:54,904 --> 00:11:59,126; ;And again, there is no RAID tiering done with this profile either.
99; ;00:11:59,126 --> 00:12:06,378; ;Keep in mind these are the three storage profiles, are the only profiles available on the SCv2000.
100; ;00:12:06,378 --> 00:12:15,626; ;The administrator doesn't have an option like they do on the other SC Series models to create his or her own profile.
101; ;00:12:17,254 --> 00:12:26,688; ;The other type of storage profile was developed specifically for a solution referred to as a Flash Optimized Solution.
102; ;00:12:26,688 --> 00:12:46,140; ;With the Flash Optimized Solution, you've got three different tiers used: tier 1 are write-intensive SSDs, tier 2 are read-intensive SSDs, and tier 3 are spinning disk, typically 7.2K HDDs or spinning disk.
103; ;00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:59,511; ;In order to support the Flash Optimized Solution which, of course, works with On-Demand Data Progression, a new type of storage profiles had to be created.
104; ;00:12:59,511 --> 00:13:10,890; ;When a customer initializes a new Flash Optimized SC Series, there are new Storage Center options for storage profiles.
105; ;00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:13,028; ;And you see those options here.
106; ;00:13:13,028 --> 00:13:14,480; ;Let's run through them quickly.
107; ;00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:17,900; ;The first one, flash only with progression.
108; ;00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:31,250; ;Writes are written to tier 1, RAID 10, to these write-intensive SSDs, and the snapshots are moved to tier 2 - RAID 5 or RAID 6.
109; ;00:13:31,254 --> 00:13:36,495; ;In this case, it's showing RAID 5 snapshot and those are read-intensive SSDs.
110; ;00:13:36,495 --> 00:13:50,192; ;This is great for storing volumes with data that requires optimal read performance, an example such as gold images or linked clones, and there may be some databases in there as well.
111; ;00:13:50,192 --> 00:13:55,250; ;The second one is flash optimized with progression.
112; ;00:13:55,250 --> 00:14:12,807; ;And this writes to tier 1, to the write-intensive SSDs at RAID 10, snapshots are moved to the read-intensive SSDs in tier 2 in RAID 5, and then off to tier 3, the HDDs that are RAID 6.
113; ;00:14:12,807 --> 00:14:23,644; ;This is the default, and it provides the most efficient storage for an enclosure that contains both read-intensive and write-intensive SSDs.
114; ;00:14:24,736 --> 00:14:28,368; ;The next one then is low priority or tier 3.
115; ;00:14:28,368 --> 00:14:40,551; ;You have writes to tier 3 RAID 10, snapshots stay in tier 3, go to RAID 5 or 6 depending on how you've got the tier 3 set up, and data always remains in tier 3.
116; ;00:14:40,551 --> 00:14:45,979; ;This is gonna provide the most cost-efficient storage sitting in the tier 3.
117; ;00:14:47,057 --> 00:14:50,648; ;The fourth one then is low priority with progression.
118; ;00:14:50,648 --> 00:14:55,134; ;This uses tier 2 to tier, excuse me, tier 3 to tier 2.
119; ;00:14:55,134 --> 00:14:59,619; ;Writes are going to occur into tier 3 as RAID 10.
120; ;00:14:59,619 --> 00:15:11,342; ;Snapshots are moved to tier 3 RAID 6 or they can go up to tier 2 RAID 5 if those pages are frequently accessed.
121; ;00:15:11,342 --> 00:15:20,001; ;They won't move up to tier 1, so they're not going to go to the write-intensive SSDs, but they will go to the read-intensive SSDs.
122; ;00:15:20,001 --> 00:15:29,785; ;It's useful for migrating large amounts of data to SC Series without overloading tier 1 because these pages will not get up to tier 1.
123; ;00:15:29,785 --> 00:15:32,842; ;And then the last one is write-intensive.
124; ;00:15:32,842 --> 00:15:39,028; ;This is writes to tier 1 RAID 10, snapshots are also kept in tier 1 as RAID 10.
125; ;00:15:39,028 --> 00:15:46,125; ;Data is going to be as fast as it can be sitting up in tier 1 write-intensive SSDs.
126; ;00:15:46,125 --> 00:15:51,139; ;And it's really useful for storing transaction logs, as well as temporary database files.
127; ;00:15:53,971 --> 00:15:58,455; ;Let's go through our last couple of review questions for this module.
128; ;00:15:58,455 --> 00:16:05,371; ;First one, "When a snapshot is taken, what happens to pages that were originally written to tier 1, RAID 10?"
129; ;00:16:05,371 --> 00:16:07,562; ;Remember that one.
130; ;00:16:07,562 --> 00:16:13,154; ;Remember, they are frozen and marked as Read Only, that happens when a snapshot occurs.
131; ;00:16:13,154 --> 00:16:19,612; ;"What SC Series system includes a Maximize Performance Storage Profile?"
132; ;00:16:19,612 --> 00:16:20,614; ;We just discussed that.
133; ;00:16:20,614 --> 00:16:22,937; ;Yep, SCv2000.
134; ;00:16:22,937 --> 00:16:24,414; ;Good.
135; ;00:16:24,414 --> 00:16:29,091; ;And then finally, "What do Storage Profiles determine?"
136; ;00:16:29,091 --> 00:16:32,993; ;And this is why they go hand in hand with Data Progression.
137; ;00:16:32,993 --> 00:16:38,217; ;They determine the RAID level and tiers on which data is stored.
1; ;00:00:01,130 --> 00:00:06,566; ;This lesson covers an overview of the File Import for SMB feature.
2; ;00:00:06,566 --> 00:00:13,995; ;It describes the feature and its use case and identifies its requirements and capabilities.
3; ;00:00:15,932 --> 00:00:23,390; ;File Import for SMB is an enhancement to the existing native file migration feature of Unity.
4; ;00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:35,169; ;It extends the capability to migrate a CIFS Server configured on a VNX VDM and its associated file systems to a Unity NAS Server and files systems.
5; ;00:00:36,527 --> 00:00:41,561; ;The VNX VDM name becomes the Unity NAS Server name.
6; ;00:00:41,561 --> 00:00:47,796; ;The VNX CIFS Server comp name becomes the Unity SMB Server name.
7; ;00:00:47,796 --> 00:00:55,198; ;The import of file data from the VNX is configured and controlled on the Unity system.
8; ;00:00:55,198 --> 00:01:02,524; ;The feature will import the VDM network addressing, routing, and VLAN configuration.
9; ;00:01:02,524 --> 00:01:15,042; ;It also imports the CIFS Server configured on the VDM, its CIFS shares along with the associated file systems, their data, and CIFS security or permissions.
10; ;00:01:16,164 --> 00:01:24,335; ;The use case of the feature is for replacing VNX1 and VNX2 legacy systems with Unity.
11; ;00:01:24,335 --> 00:01:35,274; ;The feature provides a solution for migrating a CIFS Server configured on a VDM and the associated file systems from the older systems onto Unity.
12; ;00:01:37,256 --> 00:01:47,485; ;The File Import for SMB feature will import various configurations from the VNX VDM and its physical Data Mover.
13; ;00:01:47,485 --> 00:02:00,719; ;The CIFS related configuration such as shares, local users and groups, DFS links, home directories, and network interfaces are imported to the Unity NAS Server.
14; ;00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:06,842; ;File systems mounted to the VDM are also imported including quotas.
15; ;00:02:06,842 --> 00:02:14,791; ;However, file system snapshots, snapshot schedules, or replication configurations are not imported to Unity.
16; ;00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:26,007; ;Network gateway, DNS, and routing configurations from the VNX physical Data Mover are imported to the Unity NAS Server.
17; ;00:02:26,007 --> 00:02:34,522; ;However, any NTP, CAVA, FTP, SFTP, and CEPP configurations will not be imported.
18; ;00:02:35,661 --> 00:02:45,214; ;Supported CIFS global parameters on the Data Mover will be imported as parameters specific to the Unity NAS Server.
19; ;00:02:47,114 --> 00:03:00,224; ;As with the File Import for NFS, the File Import for SMB feature uses the Inband Migration Tool, IMT, on Unity to manage and control the data migration.
20; ;00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:09,050; ;The tool migrates data to the Unity system and can start while clients are accessing data on the source VNX system.
21; ;00:03:09,050 --> 00:03:14,721; ;The first step in the process is to establish communications between the systems.
22; ;00:03:14,721 --> 00:03:20,312; ;This involves creating mobility interfaces and creating an import connection.
23; ;00:03:20,312 --> 00:03:33,490; ;The Inband Migration Tool will handle all of the communications and data transfer between the legacy VNX and Unity systems and control access to the authoritative data set.
24; ;00:03:33,490 --> 00:03:43,102; ;Next, an import session is started which will create the target NAS server and file systems on Unity, inheriting their names from the VNX.
25; ;00:03:44,193 --> 00:03:58,515; ;Essentially, the session starts with the Unity system making a remote call to the VNX to initiate a "pull" of its specified file storage resources from the VNX to Unity.
26; ;00:03:58,515 --> 00:04:09,209; ;Once created, an initial baseline copy is performed, copying the source VDM and file system attributes to the target NAS server and file systems.
27; ;00:04:10,568 --> 00:04:19,564; ;It is important to note that the Inband Migration Tool will not activate the network interface imported to the target NAS server.
28; ;00:04:20,962 --> 00:04:28,838; ;The initial copy also includes file system data that has not changed in the last hour, cold data.
29; ;00:04:28,838 --> 00:04:35,078; ;This will be the bulk of data to be copied from VNX to Unity.
30; ;00:04:35,078 --> 00:04:41,034; ;After the initial baseline copy completes, the session will be ready for cutover.
31; ;00:04:41,034 --> 00:04:47,741; ;Prior to cutover, the clients will access the authoritative data set from the source VNX.
32; ;00:04:49,636 --> 00:04:53,404; ;The next step in the process is the session cutover.
33; ;00:04:53,404 --> 00:04:59,167; ;The cutover operation is disruptive to the IO process for the SMB protocol.
34; ;00:04:59,167 --> 00:05:08,008; ;The cutover operation will rename the CIFS Server on the VNX and in the domain, then down its interface.
35; ;00:05:08,008 --> 00:05:14,616; ;The interface of the NAS server is activated and the NAS Server is joined to the domain.
36; ;00:05:14,616 --> 00:05:21,358; ;Depending upon clients and applications, usually they automatically reconnect on retry.
37; ;00:05:21,358 --> 00:05:30,556; ;Client access to the authoritative data set is cutover to the Unity NAS server and is managed by the Inband Migration Tool.
38; ;00:05:30,556 --> 00:05:37,038; ;The session performs an incremental copy to retrieve the remaining data from the VNX.
39; ;00:05:37,038 --> 00:05:46,797; ;Since this is the data that is an hour or less old, the copy will complete significantly faster than the previous baseline copy.
40; ;00:05:46,797 --> 00:05:53,228; ;The Inband Migration Tool maintains data synchronization on the systems after cutover.
41; ;00:05:53,228 --> 00:06:00,769; ;Any new client writes will be written to the NAS server and also mirrored to the VNX by the tool.
42; ;00:06:00,769 --> 00:06:08,902; ;Client reads of data that have not yet been imported to the NAS server will be retrieved from the VNX by the tool.
43; ;00:06:08,902 --> 00:06:19,772; ;The data is also copied to the Unity system, so future reads of that data will be serviced from Unity and will not have to traverse the VNX again.
44; ;00:06:19,772 --> 00:06:26,077; ;This overhead will therefore degrade client access performance during the import.
45; ;00:06:26,077 --> 00:06:35,489; ;When the incremental copy completes, the data on the systems reaches synchronization and the session is then ready to be committed.
46; ;00:06:35,489 --> 00:06:39,736; ;After cutover, the session can be paused and resumed.
47; ;00:06:39,736 --> 00:06:48,020; ;It can also be canceled and the migration will be rolled-back to the VNX without incurring any data loss.
48; ;00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:50,854; ;The rollback is disruptive to IO.
49; ;00:06:50,854 --> 00:06:58,501; ;It will deactivate the NAS server interface on the Unity system and bring up the VNX VDM interface.
50; ;00:06:58,501 --> 00:07:02,949; ;The VNX CIFS Server is renamed back to its original name.
51; ;00:07:02,949 --> 00:07:09,142; ;Clients reconnect to again access the authoritative data set from the VNX.
52; ;00:07:09,142 --> 00:07:16,339; ;The rollback also removes the created NAS server and associated file systems on the Unity system.
53; ;00:07:18,163 --> 00:07:22,438; ;The final step in the process is the session commit.
54; ;00:07:22,438 --> 00:07:32,967; ;The session state transitions to Ready to Commit when the data is fully imported and synchronized between the source VNX and the target Unity systems.
55; ;00:07:32,967 --> 00:07:45,118; ;When the session is committed, the Inband Migration Tool stops splitting client writes to the file system and the ability to rollback to the VNX is no longer available.
56; ;00:07:45,118 --> 00:07:50,617; ;A Summary Report of the import is available for download from the Unity system.
57; ;00:07:50,617 --> 00:07:54,840; ;It should be reviewed to confirm the import operation completeness.
58; ;00:07:55,964 --> 00:08:05,252; ;The authoritative data set is now solely on the Unity system and production data access is provided by the NAS server.
59; ;00:08:05,252 --> 00:08:12,933; ;The VNX VDM with its associated file systems can be retired as a separate management task.
60; ;00:08:14,738 --> 00:08:22,930; ;The File Import feature is fully managed from Unisphere, UEMCLI commands, and REST API calls.
61; ;00:08:22,930 --> 00:08:28,420; ;In Unisphere, the feature is managed from the Protection and Mobility menu selection.
62; ;00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:35,201; ;The SP interfaces on Unity for importing data are managed from its Interfaces option.
63; ;00:08:35,201 --> 00:08:39,441; ;The VDM import is fully managed from the Import option.
64; ;00:08:39,441 --> 00:08:44,948; ;Import sessions created with Unisphere are automatically started on creation.
65; ;00:08:46,054 --> 00:08:54,764; ;In UEMCLI, connectivity to the remote VNX is managed using the /remote/sys command and its attributes.
66; ;00:08:54,764 --> 00:09:02,528; ;The VDM import is managed using the /import/session/nas command and its attributes.
67; ;00:09:02,528 --> 00:09:09,190; ;Unlike Unisphere, after a session is created with UEMCLI, it must be manually started.
68; ;00:09:10,201 --> 00:09:19,029; ;With REST API, connectivity to the remote VNX is managed using its remoteSystem call and attributes.
69; ;00:09:19,029 --> 00:09:26,079; ;The VDM import is managed using its CreateVDMImport call and attributes.
70; ;00:09:26,079 --> 00:09:41,339; ;Session operations are managed using the CutoverVDMImport, CancelVDMImport, PauseVDMImport, ResumeVDMImport, and CommitVDMImport calls.
71; ;00:09:41,339 --> 00:09:48,030; ;Like UEMCLI, when an import session is created with REST, it must be manually started.
72; ;00:09:49,865 --> 00:09:56,061; ;There are several requirements for the source VNX in order to support the File Import feature.
73; ;00:09:56,061 --> 00:10:03,221; ;VNX Gateway models are not supported by the feature, only VNX File or VNX Unified systems.
74; ;00:10:04,227 --> 00:10:12,528; ;The source VNX must be running a File Operating Environment version that supports configuring CIFS on a Virtual Data Mover.
75; ;00:10:12,528 --> 00:10:18,759; ;VNX1 systems must be running File OE version 7.1.X or later.
76; ;00:10:18,759 --> 00:10:27,411; ;All versions of File OE for VNX2 systems starting at 8.1.X support the File Import feature.
77; ;00:10:27,411 --> 00:10:33,820; ;Another VNX requirement is that the VDM must be configured with a single CIFS Server.
78; ;00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:38,260; ;A VDM configured with multiple CIFS Servers is not supported.
79; ;00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:45,499; ;A VDM configured for multiprotocol with CIFS and NFS is also not supported.
80; ;00:10:45,499 --> 00:10:51,545; ;The VDM must have at least one interface for client data access.
81; ;00:10:51,545 --> 00:11:01,917; ;If the VNX Data Mover with the VDM to be migrated is used for other storage needs, the Data Mover will need an interface to access DNS.
82; ;00:11:01,917 --> 00:11:05,018; ;That interface cannot be attached to the VDM.
83; ;00:11:05,018 --> 00:11:10,874; ;Since after the import operation, any interface attached to the VDM will be downed.
84; ;00:11:10,874 --> 00:11:17,778; ;Therefore, having a dedicated interface for the Data Mover to access DNS is needed.
85; ;00:11:17,778 --> 00:11:25,447; ;A five-second time synchronization between the source VNX and the destination Unity systems is required.
86; ;00:11:25,447 --> 00:11:35,295; ;It is therefore recommended that a common NTP configuration be used for both the source VNX and the destination Unity systems.
87; ;00:11:37,274 --> 00:11:44,517; ;There are several steps required for preparing the VNX for importing the CIFS configured VDM into Unity.
88; ;00:11:45,574 --> 00:11:51,079; ;The CIFS Server on the VDM must be enabled for local users and groups.
89; ;00:11:51,079 --> 00:11:58,481; ;This local user is used when copying the source VDM file system data to the Unity NAS Server.
90; ;00:11:58,481 --> 00:12:02,490; ;The default local Administrator account is supported.
91; ;00:12:02,490 --> 00:12:11,357; ;Optionally, a similar custom user account can be created on the CIFS Server and made a member of the local Administrators group.
92; ;00:12:11,357 --> 00:12:16,680; ;By default, the local user account password must be reset upon first use.
93; ;00:12:17,867 --> 00:12:26,369; ;The local user account can be managed using the Microsoft Computer Management MMC and connecting it to the CIFS Server.
94; ;00:12:26,369 --> 00:12:30,343; ;The client running it must be a member of the domain.
95; ;00:12:30,343 --> 00:12:37,712; ;There are two Data Mover CIFS parameter values needed for importing the VNX data to Unity.
96; ;00:12:37,712 --> 00:12:43,955; ;The acl.extacl CIFS parameter value must be set to 28.
97; ;00:12:43,955 --> 00:12:49,305; ;This is needed to preserve UNIX ownership of the data which is needed for quota support.
98; ;00:12:50,379 --> 00:12:56,953; ;The acl.mappingErrorAction CIFS parameter value must be set to 11.
99; ;00:12:56,953 --> 00:13:03,020; ;This is needed to define mapping unknown SIDs to the UIDs and GIDs.
100; ;00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:08,079; ;Examples for checking and setting these parameters are shown here.
101; ;00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:20,408; ;For the source VNX VDM, beyond the requirement of having at least one interface for client access, an interface needs to be created for the file import data migration.
102; ;00:13:20,408 --> 00:13:28,420; ;This interface must begin with the specific name of "nas_migration_".
103; ;00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:39,442; ;The Inband Migration Tool looks for this interface to form a connection with the Unity system for the migration of the VDM and its file system data to Unity.
104; ;00:13:39,442 --> 00:13:43,848; ;The interface must be attached to the VDM via CLI.
105; ;00:13:43,848 --> 00:13:55,929; ;An example command is shown attaching an interface named nas_migration_SMB to a VDM named CIFS_VDM.
106; ;00:13:55,929 --> 00:14:01,602; ;Another required preparation step is needed that relates to the migration interface.
107; ;00:14:01,602 --> 00:14:15,241; ;To prevent clients from accidentally connecting to the VDM CIFS server over the migration interface, the migration interface is assigned to a DNS sub-domain of the CIFS Server.
108; ;00:14:15,241 --> 00:14:22,045; ;This will prevent the interface from being displayed should the client query the DNS name of the CIFS Server.
109; ;00:14:22,045 --> 00:14:25,595; ;The server_cifs command is used to make this assignment.
110; ;00:14:25,595 --> 00:14:42,053; ;In the example shown, the CIFS Server CIFS01 is in the hmarine.test domain, and the nas_migration_SMB interface is assigned to the sub-domain import.hmarine.test.
111; ;00:14:43,902 --> 00:14:53,043; ;When importing data using specific VNX features that are not supported on Unity, some considerations need to be made.
112; ;00:14:53,043 --> 00:15:02,785; ;Where DHSM stub files are present on a VNX file system, these files will be normal files when imported to Unity.
113; ;00:15:02,785 --> 00:15:21,363; ;For VNX file systems where space efficiency features of compression and deduplication are present, Unity factors in the space savings realized on the source VNX and creates an appropriately sized Unity file system for importing the data as normal files.
114; ;00:15:22,443 --> 00:15:28,308; ;The compressed VNX data is uncompressed for importing to Unity.
115; ;00:15:28,308 --> 00:15:36,740; ;Some other considerations relate to not changing VNX configurations when an import session is in progress.
116; ;00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:47,892; ;It is recommended that quota settings, DNS, Gateway, and routing settings remain unchanged on the VNX while an import session is ongoing.
117; ;00:15:48,954 --> 00:15:52,768; ;The Unity system cannot prevent these actions.
118; ;00:15:52,768 --> 00:16:01,197; ;Any VNX configuration changes will not be imported correctly on Unity and could break the import session.
119; ;00:16:01,197 --> 00:16:08,713; ;The same consideration applies to deleting file systems on VNX when an import session is in progress.
120; ;00:16:09,622 --> 00:16:20,168; ;When an import session is in progress to a Unity SP that is rebooted, the session will failover to the peer SP and continue normally.
121; ;00:16:20,168 --> 00:16:28,531; ;If a Unity system is rebooted that has an ongoing import session, the session is paused during the system reboot.
122; ;00:16:28,531 --> 00:16:33,256; ;After the reboot completes, the session is automatically resumed.
123; ;00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:40,556; ;The File Import feature capabilities are the same for the Unity family.
124; ;00:16:40,556 --> 00:16:46,281; ;File Import is supported on all physical Unity models and UnityVSA.
125; ;00:16:47,369 --> 00:16:52,876; ;The system is capable of supporting one VDM import session per SP.
126; ;00:16:52,876 --> 00:17:03,662; ;For a physical Unity system, there can be two simultaneous VDM import sessions if one session is to SPA and the other session is to SPB.
127; ;00:17:03,662 --> 00:17:09,461; ;The system is capable of supporting 1,000 file system imports.
128; ;00:17:09,461 --> 00:17:15,932; ;This number is shared by the two VDM import sessions possible on the physical Unity systems.
129; ;00:17:15,932 --> 00:17:28,877; ;For example, if one VDM session had 750 file systems and another VDM session had 250 file systems, this would be within the file system import capability.
130; ;00:17:28,877 --> 00:17:37,938; ;For UnityVSA systems that can only have one VDM import session, that session is capable to import 1,000 file systems.
131; ;00:17:39,627 --> 00:17:45,307; ;Information for a File Import is available from various locations.
132; ;00:17:45,307 --> 00:17:51,577; ;This information is valuable for resolving import problems if they are encountered.
133; ;00:17:51,577 --> 00:17:56,780; ;Prior to starting an Import session, a pre-check is run on the VNX.
134; ;00:17:56,780 --> 00:18:00,950; ;If the pre-check fails, a session will not be started.
135; ;00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:12,037; ;A log file for the pre-check is generated on the VNX Control Station in the hidden /home/sysadmin/.migration folder.
136; ;00:18:12,037 --> 00:18:16,028; ;It can be reviewed to identify the pre-check failure issue.
137; ;00:18:16,028 --> 00:18:25,071; ;If a session starts, its status and health are displayed from the Unisphere Protection & Mobility Sessions page.
138; ;00:18:25,071 --> 00:18:36,594; ;A cemtracer_migration.log file is also available from Unity within the /EMC/CEM/log directory.
139; ;00:18:36,594 --> 00:18:43,195; ;A Session Summary Report is available for download in Unisphere from the Sessions page.
140; ;00:18:43,195 --> 00:18:53,209; ;The report contains information for the session, all operations performed, and records any errors or problems associated with the session.
141; ;00:18:55,314 --> 00:18:57,687; ;This completes the presentation.
1; ;00:00:00,885 --> 00:00:09,716; ;Okay, in this section of the Data Mobility training, we're going to cover the File Import feature, and overview, architecture, and capabilities.
2; ;00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:27,258; ;So for its overview, the File Import feature is a native feature to Unity and it migrates data from a VNX, specifically an NFSv3 configured VDM to a Unity NAS server.
3; ;00:00:28,306 --> 00:00:35,425; ;That import session will be manually controlled by the user as data migrates to Unity.
4; ;00:00:36,506 --> 00:00:52,874; ;Things that get migrated are not only the data but also the NAS server or the VDM networking onto the NAS server, the naming services that would be associated to that VDM, the file systems, and any NFS exports associated to it.
5; ;00:00:52,874 --> 00:01:08,083; ;It has really one use case, it's simply used to migrate data that's on a VNX1 or VNX2 onto Unity so that you can replace that legacy VNX system with Unity.
6; ;00:01:12,857 --> 00:01:16,745; ;This slide shows a little bit more in detail about what gets imported.
7; ;00:01:16,745 --> 00:01:24,764; ;So on the VNX, we have to deal with configurations that are on the physical Data Mover and on the Virtual Data Mover.
8; ;00:01:24,764 --> 00:01:29,965; ;And not all of the configuration information is imported.
9; ;00:01:29,965 --> 00:01:34,317; ;Another point of interest is the Export Host Entries.
10; ;00:01:34,317 --> 00:01:41,694; ;There exists no one-to-one mapping of host entries that are available on the VNX to Unity.
11; ;00:01:41,694 --> 00:01:52,050; ;So the Unity system simply parses those entries and comes up with the best fit configuration for the NAS server.
12; ;00:01:54,761 --> 00:01:57,386; ;A little bit about the import process.
13; ;00:01:57,386 --> 00:02:01,276; ;So the first thing to talk about is the Inband Migration Tool.
14; ;00:02:01,276 --> 00:02:08,992; ;It's an engine that runs on the Unity system, and it will be controlling the migration that maintains the authoritative data set.
15; ;00:02:10,245 --> 00:02:20,386; ;It establishes or it issues commands to the VNX to import the data from the VNX.
16; ;00:02:20,386 --> 00:02:31,113; ;It also does this in a fashion that is non-disruptive to clients who are accessing data from the VNX.
17; ;00:02:31,113 --> 00:02:37,759; ;This migration happens more or less seamlessly to the client as it accesses data.
18; ;00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:58,040; ;So the first part of the process is to establish communications between the two systems and this is to allow the Inband Migration Tool to start issuing commands and understanding the configuration on the VNX that needs to be imported to the Unity system.
19; ;00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:01,148; ;So the session then gets started.
20; ;00:03:01,148 --> 00:03:15,728; ;And when you start a session, you are really selecting a specific VDM, so that VDM's configuration is created as a NAS server on the Unity system.
21; ;00:03:15,728 --> 00:03:26,738; ;Also, file systems that that VDM would be associated with also get created on the Unity system, all automatically by the Inband Migration Tool.
22; ;00:03:28,681 --> 00:03:31,584; ;The next thing to happen is a baseline copy.
23; ;00:03:31,584 --> 00:03:42,275; ;And the baseline copy includes file system information that is cold, meaning it hasn't changed within the last hour.
24; ;00:03:42,275 --> 00:03:46,498; ;There's also some configuration information that goes over.
25; ;00:03:46,498 --> 00:04:03,007; ;The networking associated with the VDM will be copied over and applied to the NAS server, but the Inband Migration Tool will not bring up any interface that is migrated over.
26; ;00:04:03,007 --> 00:04:21,655; ;It controls the interface on a NAS server and actually the interface being up on the VDM, so that's the manner in which it controls the authoritative data set, where the client is going to look for the data.
27; ;00:04:23,309 --> 00:04:32,118; ;Another thing that that baseline copy includes is any export configurations that are on those file systems.
28; ;00:04:32,118 --> 00:04:49,841; ;Next comes a series of copies to get the remaining data, the data that's newer, the data that's maybe being stored currently by clients who are actively accessing that file system.
29; ;00:04:49,841 --> 00:05:01,229; ;So if the client put on a new set of data, that new set data would be copied over by an incremental process that runs in the background.
30; ;00:05:05,033 --> 00:05:10,519; ;So the next step in the process is a cutover, and there are a lot of things happening.
31; ;00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:21,598; ;The Inband Migration Tool first will down the interface on the VDM that's on the VNX and up the interface on the NAS server.
32; ;00:05:21,598 --> 00:05:37,845; ;So the client will seamlessly access that interface for its data and the Inband Migration Tool will treat the NAS server, the data on the NAS server, as the authoritative data set.
33; ;00:05:41,514 --> 00:05:59,187; ;So if a client performs a write operation, the writes are not only stored on the NAS server on the Unity system but the Inband Migration Tool will also send or mirror those writes over to the VNX.
34; ;00:05:59,187 --> 00:06:07,465; ;This is so that the dataset that's on the VNX will be updated with any new data.
35; ;00:06:09,836 --> 00:06:32,293; ;Another thing that the Inband Migration Tool will do is if a client asks for data that hasn't yet been imported, the Inband Migration Tool traverses over to the VDM, gets the data, and it copies it to the NAS server as well as delivers it to the client as the client requested.
36; ;00:06:32,293 --> 00:06:39,258; ;Any future reads of that data can be serviced from the NAS server, it won't need to traverse over to the VNX again.
37; ;00:06:44,089 --> 00:07:01,613; ;And at some point, the data will become synchronized, that background copy operation will eventually yield a synchronization between the dataset that's on the Unity NAS server and the dataset that's on the VNX.
38; ;00:07:01,613 --> 00:07:15,439; ;So at this point, you could cancel this whole migration and the system would be rolled back and, during a rollback, we'll talk more about this in later sections.
39; ;00:07:15,439 --> 00:07:34,454; ;But if the session were to be canceled, the Inband Migration Tool would down the NAS server interface, up the VDM's interface so that the client would access its data set from the VNX, and then it would destroy what it created on the Unity system.
40; ;00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:39,839; ;The NAS server would be deleted and any of the associated file systems.
41; ;00:07:43,343 --> 00:07:52,356; ;So getting down to the final phases of the import process, now comes a commit session.
42; ;00:07:52,356 --> 00:08:04,562; ;And when a commit is made, the Inband Migration Tool stops splitting writes, there's no longer any ability to roll back.
43; ;00:08:04,562 --> 00:08:17,828; ;Once a commit is made, the data that's on the NAS server will be the production data and there will be no going back to the VNX.
44; ;00:08:21,663 --> 00:08:31,284; ;The tool also makes a Summary Report available, it can be downloaded and reviewed to see how the import session went.
45; ;00:08:33,939 --> 00:08:53,697; ;And as I said, the NAS server would be the production entity at this point, can't use the VNX anymore and you would retire the VNX VDM and any of its associated file systems as a separate task from the migration.
46; ;00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,954; ;Now let's talk about how the feature is managed.
47; ;00:08:58,954 --> 00:09:05,296; ;There's a full set of management from Unisphere as well as UEMCLI and REST API.
48; ;00:09:05,296 --> 00:09:22,951; ;So from Unisphere, basically the protection and mobility section has two entities, the Interfaces, that sets up the communications with the remote system, and the Import, that sets up the sessions.
49; ;00:09:22,951 --> 00:09:40,535; ;So within UEMCLI, establishing the communications is done with the /remote/sys commands, establishing the import sessions are sessions NAS, and they do have operational commands: cutover, cancel, pause.
50; ;00:09:40,535 --> 00:09:54,184; ;And likewise, in REST, there's a remote sys which establishes the communications, the CreateVDMImport, and then the actual operational commands.
51; ;00:09:57,614 --> 00:10:01,001; ;What are the requirements on the source VNX?
52; ;00:10:01,001 --> 00:10:07,878; ;So we need a VNX file only or Unified, Gateways are not supported.
53; ;00:10:07,878 --> 00:10:15,048; ;And we need the OE to be able to support configuring NFS on a VDM.
54; ;00:10:15,048 --> 00:10:26,816; ;So that functionality started in VNX OE code 7.1 for VNX1 and 8.1 in VNX2.
55; ;00:10:26,816 --> 00:10:30,791; ;The VDM needs to be configured for NFSv3.
56; ;00:10:30,791 --> 00:10:39,212; ;And if it's configured for NFSv4 or Secure NFS, you must disable that configuration before importing.
57; ;00:10:39,212 --> 00:10:44,865; ;If pNFS is configured, any pNFS configuration won't be imported.
58; ;00:10:46,117 --> 00:10:56,427; ;Nested Mount Point File Systems, if the VDM is involved with a Nested Mount Point File System, it won't be imported.
59; ;00:10:58,267 --> 00:11:16,944; ;The source VNX VDM interfaces have two requirements: one, interface must be available for clients to access that VDM and there needs to be an additional interface attached that has a specific name.
60; ;00:11:16,944 --> 00:11:23,328; ;And this is the interface that's going to migrate the data from the VNX to the Unity system.
61; ;00:11:23,328 --> 00:11:26,649; ;And that interface has a specific naming requirement.
62; ;00:11:26,649 --> 00:11:36,507; ;The name must be nas_migration_ and some other user-provided section to that name.
63; ;00:11:36,507 --> 00:11:38,505; ;And in this example...
64; ;00:11:38,505 --> 00:11:45,987; ;And that name can only be applied via CLI, as shown here using the NAS server command.
65; ;00:11:45,987 --> 00:11:57,448; ;And the example creates an interface on the VDM and attaches it, called nas_migration_VDM.
66; ;00:12:01,243 --> 00:12:03,564; ;File Import considerations.
67; ;00:12:03,564 --> 00:12:14,353; ;So the first part talks about feature sets that are supported on the VNX that aren't supported on Unity.
68; ;00:12:14,353 --> 00:12:26,442; ;So DHSM tiering feature: so if you have stub files on the VNX that's being migrated, they won't be stub files as they are migrated on.
69; ;00:12:26,442 --> 00:12:34,343; ;Those stub files will be imported and inflated as normal files.
70; ;00:12:34,343 --> 00:12:46,524; ;Likewise, compression and deduplication features, any of the compressed or deduplicated files will come over as normal files.
71; ;00:12:46,524 --> 00:13:03,934; ;A good thing is that this feature will understand the space savings that were realized on the VNX and it will know to increase the file system size appropriately for those fully inflated files to be imported.
72; ;00:13:03,934 --> 00:13:08,565; ;VNX operations discouraged during the import.
73; ;00:13:08,565 --> 00:13:27,920; ;So things that the baseline copy brings over like the quotas, the name services, the DNS and Gateway and network settings, those come over once during the baseline copy.
74; ;00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:34,466; ;And if those are changed on the VNX, the import feature won't capture those.
75; ;00:13:34,466 --> 00:13:39,848; ;So you shouldn't be changing any of those along with deleting any of the associated file systems.
76; ;00:13:44,086 --> 00:13:48,510; ;Another consideration is time synchronization between the two systems.
77; ;00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:57,044; ;So you need at least a five-second time synchronization between the VNX Data Mover and the Unity system.
78; ;00:13:57,044 --> 00:14:04,036; ;So we would recommend a common NTP server configuration.
79; ;00:14:04,036 --> 00:14:16,622; ;If the Unity Storage Processor involved with the session is rebooted for any reason, the session will fail over to the surviving SP.
80; ;00:14:16,622 --> 00:14:23,907; ;If the Unity system is rebooted in totality, the import session is paused during its reboot time.
81; ;00:14:23,907 --> 00:14:30,038; ;And once it's rebooted, it will automatically resume after the reboot.
82; ;00:14:34,043 --> 00:14:49,313; ;File Import capabilities, the whole Unity family of products supports this feature, all of the physical models and also the UnityVSA, the virtual Unity system also supports it.
83; ;00:14:52,455 --> 00:15:03,376; ;Only one VDM import session can be ongoing per SP at a time, so physical systems can have two sessions, one to one SP and one to another.
84; ;00:15:04,947 --> 00:15:11,499; ;UnityVSA, as it only has one Virtual Storage Processor, you can only do one session at a time.
85; ;00:15:11,499 --> 00:15:16,197; ;Only 1,000 file systems can be imported per system.
86; ;00:15:16,197 --> 00:15:28,036; ;So what that means on a physical system, you can have a total of two sessions that will have a total of 1,000 file systems.
87; ;00:15:28,036 --> 00:15:45,529; ;So if a VDM is being imported to one Storage Processor that has 750 file systems, another session can be ongoing to another Storage Processor, and that can have up to 250 file systems for the grand total of 1,000.
88; ;00:15:45,529 --> 00:15:52,176; ;On a UnityVSA, you could import a VDM that had 1,000 file systems.
89; ;00:15:55,898 --> 00:16:03,816; ;And that concludes the overview, architecture, and capabilities for the File Import feature.
1; ;00:00:02,277 --> 00:00:06,110; ;We've been talking about new features of 7.0 and 7.1.
2; ;00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:18,194; ;Let's switch gears a little bit here and we're going to finish out this module by talking about some traditional functionality that's been in the SC Series really from its inception.
3; ;00:00:18,194 --> 00:00:28,130; ;And we'll start with a discuss question here that many of you may be familiar with, "What Dell patented feature moves data to the optimum storage platform in an SC Series array?"
4; ;00:00:32,471 --> 00:00:34,478; ;Right. Data progression.
5; ;00:00:34,478 --> 00:00:44,844; ;Yep, data progression will move data to the optimum storage location based on how much that data has been accessed.
6; ;00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:56,315; ;In the next few slides, we're going to talk about Fluid Data architecture, and how data progression fits into that Fluid Data architecture approach.
7; ;00:00:58,156 --> 00:01:06,345; ;The SC Series is built around the concept of Fluid Data architecture and Fluid Data architecture technology.
8; ;00:01:06,345 --> 00:01:13,418; ;So really, Fluid Data architecture is the framework on which data progression tiering operates.
9; ;00:01:13,418 --> 00:01:30,229; ;Fluid Data architecture enables sophisticated and fully-integrated storage capabilities by managing data at the page level for efficient space utilization, quick recovery of snapshots, and affordable information lifecycle management.
10; ;00:01:30,229 --> 00:01:39,333; ;By managing the disk drives at the page level and not the drive level, the level of flexibility is significantly increased.
11; ;00:01:39,333 --> 00:01:46,243; ;What you're doing really here is looking at, this is a page pool, right?
12; ;00:01:46,243 --> 00:01:49,871; ;And their individual pages are in here.
13; ;00:01:49,871 --> 00:01:59,803; ;Those individual pages can be 512K, they can be 2 megabytes, or they can be 4 megabytes.
14; ;00:01:59,803 --> 00:02:05,843; ;Traditionally, with spinning disks, you'd see 2 megabyte as the default page size.
15; ;00:02:05,843 --> 00:02:15,128; ;With more and more flash solutions, the recommendation now is to use 512 KB, these little pages.
16; ;00:02:15,128 --> 00:02:21,275; ;So again, the key is that we're managing at that page level and not the individual drive level.
17; ;00:02:21,275 --> 00:02:34,906; ;Fluid Data architecture records and tracks specific information about every page of data, thereby providing system intelligence on how the page is being used.
18; ;00:02:34,906 --> 00:02:38,602; ;This is all metadata that we're seeing here.
19; ;00:02:38,602 --> 00:02:42,738; ;These are metadata that are associated with each page.
20; ;00:02:42,738 --> 00:02:47,328; ;This metadata takes up very small amount of resources.
21; ;00:02:48,469 --> 00:02:54,449; ;But it's critical in terms of being able to move these pages around.
22; ;00:02:54,449 --> 00:03:11,513; ;Remember now the pages go into a tier of storage, whether it's tier 1, tier 2, or tier 3, it's not the whole volume that goes into a tier it's actually pages of that that make up that volume.
23; ;00:03:11,513 --> 00:03:16,900; ;And what you see here, these are all metadata that are associated with these pages.
24; ;00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:30,734; ;So I get when was the volume created, accessed, and modification time, how often has that page been accessed, what type and tier of disk drive is that page in, what RAID level is that page on.
25; ;00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:38,220; ;What is the corresponding volume, what was the time stamp for a snapshot of that page?
26; ;00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:45,860; ;And what is the status of that page? Is it active? Is it frozen? Is it accessible? Is it inaccessible?
27; ;00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:52,150; ;So all of these things are kept at the page level, not the drive level.
28; ;00:03:52,153 --> 00:03:55,105; ;Let's take a closer look then at data progression.
29; ;00:03:55,105 --> 00:04:06,396; ;Data progression leverages cost and performance differences between storage tiers, allowing the maximum use of lower-cost, high-capacity.
30; ;00:04:06,396 --> 00:04:21,170; ;So typically, that's gonna be SAS drives, 7.2K for stored data, while maintaining performance-oriented SSD drives, or 15K SAS drives for frequently accessed data.
31; ;00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:36,491; ;Data progression takes advantage of this by automatically tracking those pages that we just talked about on the previous slide and migrating data between those storage classes based on something called a Storage Profile.
32; ;00:04:36,491 --> 00:04:50,550; ;A quick note on that, for snapshot data progression to work properly, ideally, there would be at least one snapshot taken every day and an hour overlap for snapshot expiration.
33; ;00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:58,078; ;So for example, if there was only a single daily snapshot taken, the minimum expiration time should be 25 hours.
34; ;00:04:58,078 --> 00:05:07,726; ;There's always an expiration on any time you create a snapshot, there will be an expiration time associated with that snapshot.
35; ;00:05:07,726 --> 00:05:10,786; ;We mentioned system profiles.
36; ;00:05:10,786 --> 00:05:16,282; ;Internally, in the system, there are system-defined Storage Profiles.
37; ;00:05:16,282 --> 00:05:24,130; ;The default Storage Profile that most of our customers use is the recommended Storage Profile.
38; ;00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:36,208; ;Here what you're doing is you're letting the software, the data progression software, manipulate those pages of data to the different tiers of storage.
39; ;00:05:37,575 --> 00:05:45,092; ;Cost and performance are optimized when volumes use that recommended storage profile.
40; ;00:05:46,239 --> 00:05:54,774; ;Data movement to the proper storage class is automated based on real time usage, the amount of times that page was accessed.
41; ;00:05:54,774 --> 00:05:59,141; ;All applications and operating systems require zero modification.
42; ;00:05:59,141 --> 00:06:04,379; ;Data management administrative time then, of course, is minimized.
43; ;00:06:04,379 --> 00:06:11,189; ;We're gonna talk a little bit more about storage profiles in the upcoming slides.
44; ;00:06:11,189 --> 00:06:14,750; ;You can see what it's showing there.
45; ;00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:22,108; ;High-priority in tier 1, medium-priority in tier 2, and low-priority is in tier 3.
46; ;00:06:22,108 --> 00:06:27,094; ;Those are the way that those storage profiles work.
47; ;00:06:27,094 --> 00:06:43,366; ;One thing to call out here, if data progression is not licensed and a system uses RAID 10 and RAID 5, or RAID 10 dual mirror and RAID 6, data is migrated within a tier but can't be migrated between tiers.
48; ;00:06:43,366 --> 00:06:47,454; ;And so auto tiering is in effect what happens.
49; ;00:06:47,454 --> 00:06:50,845; ;You are auto tiering within one tier of storage.
50; ;00:06:50,845 --> 00:06:58,447; ;Just as a quick note as well, the drives, the fastest drives are in tier 1.
51; ;00:06:58,447 --> 00:07:10,920; ;So whether that be SSD drives, whether that be 15k SAS drives, whatever the fastest drives are, those drives are gonna go into tier 1.
52; ;00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:17,383; ;The slowest drives then are gonna go into tier 3, down here.
53; ;00:07:17,383 --> 00:07:26,329; ;The fastest drive's up here, the slowest drives or the 7.2k drives are in tier 3, and then all other drives will be in tier 2.
54; ;00:07:26,329 --> 00:07:32,273; ;Many of our solutions that we see today have two tiers, tier 1 and tier 3.
55; ;00:07:32,273 --> 00:07:46,368; ;But the fastest go here, the slowest go tier 3, and anything else is going to go in tier 2 to allow for data progression to work.
56; ;00:07:46,368 --> 00:07:52,634; ;Let's talk about how data progression works and try to answer this question, "where's the data?"
57; ;00:07:52,634 --> 00:08:03,620; ;The data progression software allows the user to create volumes which will take advantage of using multiple RAID types and multiple different types of disks.
58; ;00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:19,262; ;This will enable frequently accessed data to be on the highest performing RAID type on the highest performance class of disk, while less frequently accessed data will reside on lower performance RAID type on a lower performance disk.
59; ;00:08:19,262 --> 00:08:31,337; ;If I'm using the recommended storage profiles, we just talked about storage profiles a moment ago, if I'm using the recommended storage profiles when I write new data, they're gonna go into tier 1.
60; ;00:08:31,337 --> 00:08:35,713; ;They're gonna go into tier 1 as RAID 10.
61; ;00:08:35,713 --> 00:08:42,407; ;Because RAID 10 is the fastest, has the fastest write capability of any type of RAID.
62; ;00:08:42,407 --> 00:08:51,146; ;So it's gonna write into tier 1, to the fastest drives at the fastest RAID types, and that's gonna be RAID 10.
63; ;00:08:53,164 --> 00:08:54,309; ;Groups...
64; ;00:08:54,309 --> 00:09:07,626; ;Disk speeds 7l, 10k, 15k and SSDs, so what happens then is data progression uses that Fluid Data architecture to move data to performance-appropriate and cost-effective disk drives.
65; ;00:09:07,626 --> 00:09:10,577; ;So I can have some pages in tier 1.
66; ;00:09:10,577 --> 00:09:18,644; ;Aged snapshots will move down to tier 2 into RAID 5.
67; ;00:09:18,644 --> 00:09:23,390; ;You can also, RAID 5 would be single redundancy.
68; ;00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:25,313; ;RAID 6 would be dual redundancy.
69; ;00:09:25,313 --> 00:09:31,504; ;So this could be RAID 6 as well down in tier 2, but that's typically aged snapshot data.
70; ;00:09:31,504 --> 00:09:35,105; ;Those are pages that haven't been accessed as often.
71; ;00:09:35,105 --> 00:09:42,862; ;Typically if a page hasn't been accessed in 12 days, it will move down to tier 2.
72; ;00:09:42,862 --> 00:09:47,427; ;This is using the recommended storage profile.
73; ;00:09:47,427 --> 00:09:53,746; ;Aged snapshot data, if it's another 12 days, it will move down to tier 3.
74; ;00:09:53,746 --> 00:09:56,465; ;This is doing it by the page.
75; ;00:09:56,465 --> 00:09:57,471; ;And then something called...
76; ;00:09:57,471 --> 00:10:03,829; ;If a page has got a status of inaccessible, it will immediately jump down to tier 3.
77; ;00:10:03,829 --> 00:10:06,983; ;And we'll talk more about that here in the upcoming slides.
78; ;00:10:06,983 --> 00:10:11,214; ;Keep in mind that, notice you'll also see arrows back up.
79; ;00:10:11,214 --> 00:10:13,331; ;So the same thing happens here.
80; ;00:10:13,331 --> 00:10:26,357; ;If data is sitting down in tier 3, typically cold data, if it starts heating up, in other words, these pages start getting accessed more, they will move up to tier 2, and then up to tier 1.
81; ;00:10:26,357 --> 00:10:32,019; ;And generally it takes about three days of activity to move up a tier.
82; ;00:10:32,019 --> 00:10:39,111; ;Three days to move up to tier 2, another three days of activity to move up to tier 1.
83; ;00:10:39,111 --> 00:10:43,508; ;And again, this is using that recommended storage profile.
84; ;00:10:43,508 --> 00:10:50,639; ;This is traditional data progression what was released initially with the SC Series.
85; ;00:10:50,639 --> 00:10:59,942; ;On-Demand data progression helps take full advantage of read-intensive SSD drives or RI drives.
86; ;00:10:59,942 --> 00:11:12,653; ;The SC Series engineers developed approach to data progression to support these write-intensive SSDs and read-intensive SSDs.
87; ;00:11:12,653 --> 00:11:15,100; ;It was called On-Demand data progression.
88; ;00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:21,787; ;In effect what happens with on-demand data progression, it's scheduled to run following a snapshot.
89; ;00:11:23,005 --> 00:11:29,998; ;Traditional data progression typically runs at a time designated by the customer.
90; ;00:11:31,050 --> 00:11:33,717; ;The default is like 7 pm.
91; ;00:11:33,717 --> 00:11:44,035; ;But typically what you're trying to do is for traditional data progression to run at a time where there's not a lot of activity, not a lot of other activity on the storage array.
92; ;00:11:45,274 --> 00:11:51,231; ;With on-demand data progression, it's effectively gonna run after a snapshot.
93; ;00:11:51,231 --> 00:12:11,677; ;So whether that snapshot is created by a snapshot profile, by an application snapshot such as the snapshot manager, or a manual snapshot, pages will be moved from write-intensive SSDs to read-intensive SSDs once that snapshot is completed for the volume.
94; ;00:12:11,677 --> 00:12:14,943; ;These snapshots are considered mountable.
95; ;00:12:14,943 --> 00:12:18,718; ;They are just like any other snapshots in our array.
96; ;00:12:19,874 --> 00:12:30,307; ;There's a new type of snapshot that was introduced with On-Demand data progression and that is something called a Space Management Snapshot.
97; ;00:12:30,307 --> 00:12:44,770; ;What happens with the space management snapshot is when tier 1, when the write-intensive SSDs fill to roughly 95 percent capacity, a space management snapshot is taken.
98; ;00:12:44,770 --> 00:12:51,577; ;And once that space management snapshot is taken, the pages are moved from tier 1 to tier 2.
99; ;00:12:51,577 --> 00:12:57,605; ;That happens automatically when you get to 95 percent, so the user doesn't have to remember to do it.
100; ;00:12:57,605 --> 00:13:08,601; ;The only reason we do that space management snapshot is to free up space on these write-intensive SSD drives that are sitting in tier 1.
101; ;00:13:10,907 --> 00:13:17,195; ;They are the most expensive drives, so we want to make sure we're saving room on those drives for new writes that come in.
102; ;00:13:17,195 --> 00:13:21,053; ;Remember new writes are coming in at RAID 10.
103; ;00:13:21,053 --> 00:13:23,977; ;So a space management snapshot is taken.
104; ;00:13:23,977 --> 00:13:28,100; ;Now these snapshots are not mountable.
105; ;00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:36,217; ;So they are strictly to save space in tier 1, hence the name Space Management snapshot.
106; ;00:13:36,217 --> 00:13:43,697; ;I just want to call your attention to that note down there, "Most tier 3 drives sold today are 7.2k RPM."
107; ;00:13:43,697 --> 00:13:53,125; ;And we just call that out because the slide shows 7.2, 10 or 15k RPM drives are typically used in tier 3.
108; ;00:13:53,125 --> 00:14:03,062; ;These days 95 percent or more drives that are in tier 3 are 7.2k RPM spinning discs.
109; ;00:14:05,602 --> 00:14:11,211; ;Let's talk about a licensed storage center feature called FastTrack.
110; ;00:14:11,211 --> 00:14:21,911; ;With FastTrack enabled, data is promoted and demoted from the outer and inner tracks of a disk using the same algorithms that are implemented for data progression.
111; ;00:14:26,118 --> 00:14:31,670; ;When you think of FastTrack, think of it as data progression tiers on a spinning platter.
112; ;00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:42,124; ;So if you are on the outside edge of the platter, that's like the RAID 10 because that's gonna be the fastest access.
113; ;00:14:42,124 --> 00:14:47,941; ;Because this is gonna reserve the outside of the platters for the most active pages.
114; ;00:14:47,941 --> 00:14:51,377; ;That's really what FastTrack is designed to do.
115; ;00:14:51,377 --> 00:14:58,750; ;One thing to be aware of with FastTrack is it only applies to spinning disk drives, not SSDs.
116; ;00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:06,373; ;So it is truly a function of the spinning media and not the SSD drives.
117; ;00:15:06,373 --> 00:15:18,786; ;As we said, reserves the outer half of the tracks for the most active pages, and it dynamically and automatically places those pages on the outside of the platter.
118; ;00:15:18,786 --> 00:15:28,390; ;FastTrack configuration optimizes the storage usage and seek time is minimized because those pages are on the outside of the platter.
119; ;00:15:28,390 --> 00:15:33,623; ;So it doesn't have to go internal to the drives to find a page.
120; ;00:15:33,623 --> 00:15:39,760; ;Those pages that it uses the most are on the outside of the platters.
121; ;00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:43,371; ;Let's talk about snapshots in the SC Series.
122; ;00:15:43,371 --> 00:15:50,767; ;In the SC Series, currently, a snapshot is licensed as something referred to as a Data Instant Replay.
123; ;00:15:50,767 --> 00:15:59,935; ;If you've been a longtime user or have worked with the SC Series for a while, you are familiar with that term "Replay."
124; ;00:15:59,935 --> 00:16:03,548; ;In the interface nowadays, you will see the term "snapshot" used.
125; ;00:16:03,548 --> 00:16:12,663; ;Data Instant Replay is the license feature as of this release, and snapshots are what we're actually gonna be talking about here.
126; ;00:16:12,663 --> 00:16:15,862; ;They leverage Fluid Data architecture.
127; ;00:16:15,862 --> 00:16:24,692; ;A couple of things you can see there, they allow quick recovery from data hazards by creating any number of space-efficient Point-in-Time Copies.
128; ;00:16:24,692 --> 00:16:29,472; ;Internally you'll hear those referred to as PITCs, it's what they're referred to as.
129; ;00:16:29,472 --> 00:16:33,206; ;You can roll back time for instantaneous restore.
130; ;00:16:33,206 --> 00:16:39,004; ;They're great for testing with production data, and you can reduce frequency of tape backups.
131; ;00:16:39,004 --> 00:16:47,838; ;So they by no means they replace tape backups, but they can be used to reduce the amount of time as you take a tape backup.
132; ;00:16:47,838 --> 00:16:53,044; ;Other things that are nice about our snapshot functionality, there's no pre-allocation needed.
133; ;00:16:53,044 --> 00:16:55,606; ;So there's not anything set up.
134; ;00:16:55,606 --> 00:17:06,777; ;When the SC Series is installed, you're not setting up a certain percentage of snapshot space or a certain amount of megabytes or gigabytes for snapshots.
135; ;00:17:06,777 --> 00:17:08,922; ;There's no pre-allocation at all.
136; ;00:17:08,922 --> 00:17:12,166; ;There's no duplication of data.
137; ;00:17:12,166 --> 00:17:17,999; ;It automatically coalesces the data, we'll talk about how that works here in the next few slides.
138; ;00:17:17,999 --> 00:17:26,831; ;There's pretty much an unrestricted number of snapshots per volume just based on the way that the snapshot functionality works in the SC Series.
139; ;00:17:26,831 --> 00:17:32,570; ;I can have multiple schedules per volume, so I can have any number of snapshots taken.
140; ;00:17:32,570 --> 00:17:37,213; ;If it's a critical volume, you might want one every half hour or so.
141; ;00:17:37,213 --> 00:17:41,005; ;If it's less critical, one a day is plenty, right?
142; ;00:17:41,005 --> 00:17:49,892; ;Another key takeaway is that snapshots that are recovered are full read-write volumes, and they can be mapped up to any server that you want.
143; ;00:17:53,901 --> 00:18:01,667; ;In the next couple of slides here, we want to take you through how a snapshot works, and how it...
144; ;00:18:01,667 --> 00:18:09,400; ;Give you kind of a little microcosm of how it works, to give you kind of an idea of how you can recover a snapshot as well.
145; ;00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:20,095; ;We started out with our fictitious volume here, we're writing data, and let's say, remember these pages are, 2 meg pages.
146; ;00:18:20,095 --> 00:18:23,250; ;So you're not talking about an actual volume here.
147; ;00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:25,196; ;But let's look at it from this standpoint.
148; ;00:18:25,196 --> 00:18:35,224; ;I've got five 2 meg pages, A, B, C, D, and E, and those are active and they're being written to, and all is good.
149; ;00:18:35,224 --> 00:18:37,271; ;I want to take a snapshot.
150; ;00:18:37,271 --> 00:18:43,815; ;We have time zero listed there, could be 1 pm as an example.
151; ;00:18:43,815 --> 00:18:51,887; ;So what happens is those pages that are snapped at that time are frozen.
152; ;00:18:51,887 --> 00:19:09,534; ;There's no movement, this is a Point-in-Time Copy as we said but the snapshots in the SC Series differ from the traditional Point-in-Time Copy concept in the blocks or pages as we call them are frozen and they're not copied.
153; ;00:19:09,534 --> 00:19:13,882; ;These pages here have been frozen.
154; ;00:19:13,882 --> 00:19:20,890; ;C1 represents a page that was written, maybe just a change made.
155; ;00:19:20,890 --> 00:19:26,944; ;If I use an example of, take a real basic example here of a PowerPoint.
156; ;00:19:26,944 --> 00:19:34,255; ;I'm building a PowerPoint presentation, and I take a snapshot of that PowerPoint presentation.
157; ;00:19:35,123 --> 00:19:40,606; ;After the snapshot, another 10 minutes later, I make a change.
158; ;00:19:40,606 --> 00:19:43,141; ;I add some animation, for example.
159; ;00:19:43,141 --> 00:19:45,698; ;And so that's a new page.
160; ;00:19:45,698 --> 00:19:49,220; ;That is C1 as we'll say in our example here.
161; ;00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:52,519; ;I then take another snapshot.
162; ;00:19:52,519 --> 00:20:00,943; ;It can be a manual snapshot and I'm saying I want to make sure that this is protected and this includes that animation.
163; ;00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:06,702; ;I make some more changes, maybe I add a new slide.
164; ;00:20:06,702 --> 00:20:10,670; ;Maybe I add some more animation, whatever the case.
165; ;00:20:10,670 --> 00:20:12,995; ;That's going to create new pages.
166; ;00:20:12,995 --> 00:20:17,487; ;So any time I make any changes, I'm going to create new pages.
167; ;00:20:17,487 --> 00:20:26,157; ;The key takeaway there is none of these pages that have been snapped, they are all frozen, and they cannot be changed.
168; ;00:20:26,157 --> 00:20:37,730; ;Any changes that occur, whether it even be adding animation or whether it be even deleting animation, but those pages can't be changed - which makes sense if you think about it.
169; ;00:20:37,730 --> 00:20:44,866; ;Because those pages would be what I would have to recover back to if I had to recover from that snapshot.
170; ;00:20:44,866 --> 00:20:48,365; ;I've got 2 new pages there.
171; ;00:20:48,365 --> 00:20:50,757; ;That is considered an active snapshot.
172; ;00:20:50,757 --> 00:20:57,692; ;In our interface if you look at an active snapshot, think of that almost like an active volume.
173; ;00:20:57,692 --> 00:21:02,121; ;Those are pages, the C2 and E1 can be changed.
174; ;00:21:02,121 --> 00:21:10,391; ;So if I added animation, I removed animation, that's all those affected on the existing pages - like C2 and E1 in this case.
175; ;00:21:10,391 --> 00:21:22,983; ;If I look at the current volume, one that's being used, it's actually made up of pages A, B, C2, D and E1.
176; ;00:21:22,983 --> 00:21:34,650; ;Because there has not been any changes made to A, B, and D, those pages, and C2 and E1 are more recent changes to those pages.
177; ;00:21:35,476 --> 00:21:36,516; ;Let's talk about them.
178; ;00:21:36,516 --> 00:21:40,342; ;What if I have to recover a volume?
179; ;00:21:40,342 --> 00:21:42,472; ;Let's talk about snapshot recovery.
180; ;00:21:42,472 --> 00:21:55,621; ;Here you are seeing the source volume, the current volume as we refer to it as, but let's say that we have to recover back to time 0.
181; ;00:21:55,621 --> 00:21:59,656; ;Remember, we said we took this snapshot at 1 o'clock.
182; ;00:21:59,656 --> 00:22:05,735; ;What if I want to recover back to that, using our fictional example of a PowerPoint slide?
183; ;00:22:05,735 --> 00:22:08,312; ;What if I had to recover back to that?
184; ;00:22:08,312 --> 00:22:09,976; ;Well, I can do that.
185; ;00:22:09,976 --> 00:22:16,575; ;This recovered volume then is considered a View Volume.
186; ;00:22:16,575 --> 00:22:29,038; ;If you take a look at the pages that are part of the View Volume, you notice that it is A, B, C, D, and E, all the ones that were there when that snap was taken at 1 o'clock.
187; ;00:22:29,038 --> 00:22:44,739; ;Those make up a recovered volume in this case, and again going back to our sort of real world example, that's gonna be our PowerPoint presentation as of 1 o'clock when that was taken.
188; ;00:22:44,739 --> 00:22:56,297; ;If I add now, let's say this is my recovered snapshot from 1 o'clock, I want to add another slide to that deck.
189; ;00:22:56,297 --> 00:23:04,337; ;I can certainly do that, notice it's being added to the recovered volume, to that branch.
190; ;00:23:04,337 --> 00:23:11,092; ;It becomes part of the newest data set and it's considered active on volume 2.
191; ;00:23:11,092 --> 00:23:14,240; ;It has no effect here on the source volume.
192; ;00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:19,732; ;The point that we're trying to make here is these are two completely separate volumes.
193; ;00:23:19,732 --> 00:23:26,143; ;And I can do what I want with this volume, and I can continue to work on the source volume as well.
194; ;00:23:26,143 --> 00:23:39,707; ;If the snapshot was taken then on volume 2, this being volume 2, only the new writes on volume 2 would be in that snapshot, and it would be independent of volume 1 data.
195; ;00:23:39,707 --> 00:23:49,187; ;As we discussed earlier, every snapshot you create has to have an expiration time or an expiration date associated with it.
196; ;00:23:49,187 --> 00:23:58,202; ;Because remember, snapshots do not replace long-term backups - they do need to be expired when they are no longer required.
197; ;00:23:58,202 --> 00:24:10,831; ;When a snapshot expires the required pages are coalesced, is the term used, into the next snapshot.
198; ;00:24:10,831 --> 00:24:16,237; ;You see this snapshot has hit its expiration time.
199; ;00:24:16,237 --> 00:24:19,896; ;Newer written data takes precedence in a conflict.
200; ;00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:31,894; ;Let's kind of watch as the expiration occurs, as I should say the coalescing occurs based on the expiration.
201; ;00:24:31,894 --> 00:24:42,737; ;That coalescing is what's going to free up space that was originally used for the initial snapshot.
202; ;00:24:42,737 --> 00:24:50,907; ;Space from older data that's no longer required is then released back into the common pool to free up more space.
203; ;00:24:53,878 --> 00:24:59,670; ;We've mentioned this earlier that pages have different accessibility characteristics.
204; ;00:24:59,670 --> 00:25:16,771; ;You kind of see this a volume that we've had, four actual snapshots taken on it, and these pages here, A3 and F1, represent the active snapshot.
205; ;00:25:16,771 --> 00:25:25,417; ;The pages you see there, A3 and F1, the blue pages, are considered accessible read-write data.
206; ;00:25:25,417 --> 00:25:32,916; ;This is the newest and most current data and anything changed in these pages will be changed on the current volume.
207; ;00:25:32,916 --> 00:25:36,759; ;So those pages have not been...
208; ;00:25:36,759 --> 00:25:39,998; ;There's no snapshot been taken on any of those pages.
209; ;00:25:39,998 --> 00:25:49,004; ;That's as opposed to the yellow pages there, which are considered accessible but they're read-only.
210; ;00:25:49,004 --> 00:26:01,741; ;Remember that any time a snapshot is taken, those pages are frozen and marked as read-only, so these are accessible read-only pages, that's the internal term for them.
211; ;00:26:05,453 --> 00:26:10,570; ;A snapshot was taken of those pages, and those pages have not been changed since then.
212; ;00:26:10,570 --> 00:26:21,591; ;Remember that you can see what's all part of the current volume ar the blues and the yellows, I guess, or the golds.
213; ;00:26:21,591 --> 00:26:27,700; ;The third one you see, the red pages, those are considered inaccessible read-only.
214; ;00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:43,237; ;Inaccessible read-only pages are pages that have been frozen and they move immediately down to the most inexpensive disk, they go down to tier 3, if that's the case.
215; ;00:26:43,237 --> 00:26:45,980; ;So that means data has been changed on those pages.
216; ;00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:53,050; ;You'll see that on all the red ones, you'll see a newer page than the one that was initially done.
217; ;00:26:53,050 --> 00:27:11,885; ;The pages, their snapshot has been taken, the data is marked read-only and can only be accessed through recovering of a View Volume, kind of like the example we used where we went back to the initial snapshot at 1 pm.
218; ;00:27:11,885 --> 00:27:18,956; ;Snapshot data consists of only the data that has been changed, the deltas.
219; ;00:27:18,956 --> 00:27:27,522; ;And again, after a snapshot is taken on a volume, all active pages move to a status of read-only.
220; ;00:27:27,522 --> 00:27:37,801; ;As we've talked about earlier on the previous slide, the current volume, that is made up of accessible read-write data and accessible read-only data.
221; ;00:27:40,512 --> 00:27:44,090; ;It's time for some review questions here.
222; ;00:27:44,090 --> 00:27:48,422; ;First one, "List the two types of data pages that can be read only."
223; ;00:27:50,691 --> 00:27:54,313; ;Right, accessible and inaccessible.
224; ;00:27:54,313 --> 00:27:56,285; ;Yeah, just talked about that.
225; ;00:27:56,285 --> 00:27:57,359; ;True or false.
226; ;00:27:57,359 --> 00:28:02,795; ;The FastTrack feature can improve performance on both HDDs and SSDs.
227; ;00:28:02,795 --> 00:28:05,243; ;So spinning drives or SSDs.
228; ;00:28:05,243 --> 00:28:07,340; ;Can it improve performance on both?
229; ;00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:08,627; ;No, it can't, right?
230; ;00:28:08,627 --> 00:28:11,939; ;Just spinning hard drives, the HDDs.
231; ;00:28:11,939 --> 00:28:17,003; ;And then finally, what type of data progression allows for Space Management snapshots?
232; ;00:28:19,671 --> 00:28:21,350; ;On Demand Data progression.
233; ;00:28:21,350 --> 00:28:23,606; ;Yeah, good, good.
